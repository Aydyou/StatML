0	2	a	Sorry I have to write a review for this, but I am not able to find the hours this location is open. Does anyone have that information???  :)  Thank you in advance!
1	1	a	"I have had my car washed here once before and was very impressed with the level of detail that the guy took with the interior. As a result I chose to return with my car for an. interior detailed specifically. \nI explained that I wanted to have the carpets cleaned and the interior cleaned thoroughly. The vehicle is only two years old so this isn't a difficult task. I dropped the vehicle off and was told it would take an hour and a half to two hours. 45 minutes later I received a phone call telling me my vehicle was done.\nWhen I arrived it took only a moment to discover that the interior had hardly been touched. They had wiped down my leather seats with some shiny substance and touched nothing else. The guy had the audacity to ask me if the job was acceptable    \nI politely explained that obviously there was some type of miscommunication and that my vehicle was not complete. I pointed out several obvious areas that established the vehicle still needed to be vacuumed, the dash still needed to be wiped down, there \nwere drip spots on the console where the straw in my drink had flipped fluid and dried. \nAs they began the process of actually cleaning my vehicle, The bullshit excuses began. These guys actually suggested that they chose not to armor all my wheels, and extra that I had been charged for specifically, because it \""stains the wheels over time\"" ridiculous!!!\nIn the end I was charged $80 for an interior detail with carpet cleaning, the majority of which was never done. Total scam artists stay away!!!"
2	1	a	"Sign outside says $4.99 for two entries. When you ask about it, they tell you that the sign is for some kind of buffet style food before 3pm. When I left I checked the she sign did not say anything about \""before 3pm\"". So there are you standing there ready to eat some food and you just order anyway. I did not really appreciate the bait and switch scam crap. The portions were decent although the food was kind of bland. I give one star because I did not like going in for the special advertised on the window and then told it is not available. That is not the proper way to run a business."
3	2	a	A Yogurtland is a Yogurtland. They are all pretty much the same to me: good quality yogurt, decent selection of flavors, lots of yummy toppings, and fair per ounce pricing.  Since I like Yogurtland, I was excited when this location opened up in Henderson. \n\nJust like the Town Square location, by biggest gripe with this Yogurtland is that they do not cut their fruit toppings smaller. And that is admittedly a very minor gripe. \nThis location also gets rather busy in the evenings...  Currently on Monday evenings  buy-1-get-1-free promotion that runs from 4-7 pm, you can pretty much count on a long line on Mondays. \n\nThe good far outweighs the bad at Yogurtland in my opinion. There is always a large selection of flavors, including sugar free options. The yogurt and toppings have nutritional info like the calories count per ounce, helpful for us ladies watching our waistlines. The staff is usually quite friendly and helpful. The toppings are fresh, there is a good variety of fruit toppings as well candy, and my personal favorite popping boba! \n\nBe sure to download the Yogurtland app, not only do you not have to dig through your wallet for a rewards card, but you also get 3 free ounces if you do!
4	2	a	The dirty chai is the single greatest smoothie I have ever had in my life. And I've had a lot of smoothies. This place is amazing. I've been talking about it for weeks. Found it on Yelp when I was driving through Vegas, on my way to Utah for work. Can not say enough about it. Great staff, gorgeous place, delicious smoothie!!! Thank you Grass Roots!
5	2	a	This is a small juice/smoothie/soup bar, and don't let the size or area of town steer you away. This place is a hidden gem! \n\nI had been wanting to step in here after I my Bikram classes, unfortunately, they are not open very late (I take evening classes). I had happen to take an early class and was able to try this place out. \n\nI ordered their Tortilla Soup, which was amazing!!! I'm so impressed by the freshness and creativeness of this soup. Since almost everything they use is vegan, it was refreshing to be able to have vegan tortilla soup! Best part was it was MADE TO ORDER. They blend everything together right there in front of you even asking how spicy I had wanted it. \n\nI will definitely be back in the future to try other items. However, it is a bit expensive so it doesn't have me wanting to come back every day.
6	2	a	I reviewed a message from the manager, Dawn, less than 24 hours from my first visit apologizing about the situation. I think it's great when a manager can admit to faults and grow themselves and their team from mistakes. I was not expecting her to reach out to me or invite me to come back for a great experience. I understand that mistakes happen and they are all teachable moments, it just depends on the accountability and ownership and their actions to rectify moving forward. I have accepted her invitation to come back and look forward to the great experience she guarantees I will have.
7	1	a	"Mmm there are many places that offer \""clean eating \"" with more flavor.  Their sauce is ... Just weak , no flavor :( so sad because I would love a healthy yummy option near here .   \n\n2 stars came only from good service , manager and servers were very pleasing just my tummy was not pleased .  \n\nAlso their \""side\"" veg option sucks , it's just one Huuuge order of same plain veg.   Needs mixing up option.  And people , huge loads of white rice is never the best \""clean\"" food lol"
8	2	a	Loved the Japchae!
9	1	a	Too bad I can't give this place zero stars. The only people that actually say good things about this place are just family members of the owners and friends of the owners. The absolute worst service me and my girlfriend have EVER received at a beauty salon. First they are completely rude to us while they're working on my girlfriend's hair and then they over charge us money when it clearly says that hair cuts are $5 and get completely defensive when we call them out on it. The owners themselves were came out and were completely rude to us. THE WORST PLACE EVER, DO YOURSELF A FAVOR AND GO TO ANY BEAUTY SALON THAT IS NOT THIS ONE.
10	2	a	Good gelato, but not quite as good as the Gelato Spot!  We stopped in today and the staff was super welcoming and friendly.  I tried the strawberries and champagne and really liked it.  Great treat when visiting the Biltmore shopping center!
11	2	a	I love this firehouse!! Friendly staff and delicious food! Very clean too. I got the turkey bacon ranch sub...sooo good! Make sure to try some of their house sauce with your sub!  Delish!
12	2	a	Alston is a talented professional in every sense of the word. I recently had the pleasure of working with him on a charity event for our local Museum of Art where he helped to source, dress and create the looks for the entertainment of the evening, twenty five in total. His creativity & level of excitement was infectious and the quality of his work was far beyond our expectations. I would highly recommend him to anyone, I can whole-heartedly say that they won't be disappointed.
13	2	a	Last week my hairdresser really did a job on my hair. I had 4 or 5 different colors in my hair and he chopped it really bad. So I thought I would take a chance and make an appointment with Jennifer, to my amazement she worked magic on my hair. She  re colored my hair and did an amazing hair cut. She was an absolute doll very nice, funny and very professional. I finally found someone who knows how to ask you what you would like done and she does it even better. I would recommend her absolutely. Thanks. Sheri z
14	2	a	This place is amazing. So glad they opened up in my neighborhood. Burgers are amazing and the staff is extremely polite.
15	2	a	"New place that opened up within the past month on the SE side of town, near No. 1 boba, on Silverado Ranch and Eastern. Shop FACES silverado ranch. Same \""building\"" as No 1 boba. \n\nI was told that the ice cream is from San Jose. \n\nThis is not your ordinary ice cream ! Taro has a slight texture where you can feel the \""grainy-ness\"" of the root in the ice cream. Macapuno (young coconut) has actual pieces of young coconut (like what you'd get from inside a young coconut). \n\nThese two are my favorite. Not too sweet. Good flavoring. \n\nGreen tea was a little disappointing. Not too strong in green tea flavor (im a sucker for strong tea flavor hence why i like Cafe Teaze's teas) \n\nHeath Bar Ice cream was good too ! nice to get some good sized bite pieces in the ice cream for you to be surprised by and enjoy :D \n\nCookies and cream is very well made. Cookies throughout and flavored nicely ! \n\nAs i had mentioned in my tip, dont let the prices scare you. They are VERY generous in scoop sizes and you do get your money's worth ! \n\nCloses somewhat early (10pm) but when we went, everyone rushed near closing and created a line XD"
16	2	a	I had a maple cronut plus a scoop of eis cream...absolutely wonderful!\n\nEveryone should give this beautiful place a try.
17	2	a	Sure it's a giant Hershey's store...but there's a lot of interesting things in the store that you don't see in regular stores that sell Hershey's products.\n\nThe setup is similar...VERY similar to the M&M's store across the street (brah, you have a competitor now!), except this store features a bakery and a photo booth instead of a movie screening and...I guess statues where you can take photos with.\n\nEverything in this store is chocolate related, not surprisingly. They even have a Hershey's statue of the Empire State Building and the Statue of Liberty, which is quite chocolate-ly delicious.\n\nEven if you're not planning to buy something in this store, do at least pay a visit here just because it's something Vegas has (many people visit the M&M store across the street for the hell of it, why not here?).
18	1	a	Bad experiance. The chocolate was way way way over priced (8.98 for a pound of hershys kisses) a few other souvinears 20$ or more. The environment wasn't that great either. A lot of people in a small area. Mainly the first floor is hershys the second floor is a mix of Twizzlers and Jolly Ranchers. What?! I thought I was at Hershy's world. When I called to complain about it on the phone, the lady I talked to was not helpful. She said I'm sorry that you had a bad experiance and I hope you come back. Well if I am calling to complain, then I probably don't want to come back. She couldv'e at least wrote my complaint down to send to a supervisor or something like that but just to say I hope you come back soon. Really. No.  I was really dissapointed in the place all over. I was so excited to have a hershys world here in Vegas but when we got there it was a total let down.  Come here if you want over priced candy in a crowded small building
19	2	a	This place is awesome.  So nice to have options for us locals. For years we had to settle for just m&m and coke, now we got my fav reeses. Couple suggestions, samples and add more dark chocolate.
20	1	a	"Unfortunately, I am not a fan of Donutsville. I stopped in at around 7AM (two hours after they opened). I was greeted by silence, and then an awkward comment that didn't make me feel welcome. I had never been there before, so I asked if there was a \""favorite\"" or anything they recommend. The response I got was, \""they're just donuts...\""\n\nThen, after seeing that they have muffins on the menu, I asked for one. But alas...\n\n\""We don't have muffins. What you see out is all we have. We're kind of like an old school bakery. Do you understand what an old school bakery is?\"" \n\nAt that point, I just wanted to leave, but I decided to at least give the donuts a chance. They were definitely fresh, which is why I added a star. They only seemed a little better than a fresh box of donuts you could get from a grocery store. I actually did enjoy the Maple Bacon donut.\n\n$10 for 7 donuts is too expensive for the quality of the donuts and the service received."
21	2	a	Love this place. Best staff. Best subs. Speedy service. 5 stars every visit. We eat here once a week. Something for everyone
22	1	a	Just terrible.\n\nSign outside says $5 drafts - night special, Tilted Kilt night.  Great, we say!  We'd love a happy hour draft on a hot day.\n\nWe walk in, find a seat at the crowded bar, and order two Miller Lites.\n\nBill comes, and we're charged $16.  What!?  I ask, he tells me the $5 is for industry night, and only applies to those in industry.  What does that even mean?  I say the sign does not say that, and he argues it does.  I go out to the sign three times to confirm, and every time tell him it does not.\n\nHe says, well you're wrong, but because you're causing an issue, I will just charge you $10.  Of course you will, because I am not wrong (and, isn't the customer always right anyways?), and you really should check your signs, and honor them.  Maybe most of the people that come in here have really taken Vegas to the extreme so do not notice the bill, but that's just dishonest business.\n\nNever again in this location.  Never again in any location.
23	2	a	Came in the am for my free coffee on opening day!  I am a first timer and I can say I'm officially a fan.  Employees were all very friendly and I even took a selfie with them!  Love it!  They were all smiles.\n\nMusic was loud but that makes the environment fun.  I had the Cocomo on ice and it was very good.\n\nThis compared to Starbucks?  Both are equally good and close to price.  I like both.\n\nCan't wait to try more!
24	2	a	5 stars for the friendliness and politeness of the staff. Their product in not bad at all, either. I had the double choc mocha and it was very good. \n\nWill be back here everyday.
25	1	a	"I really wanted to like this place since it is new and a family business. \nMy first day I walked in and a kid took off running from laying on the couch. A few minutes later some one comes out to help me. (I should of just took my stuff and went somewhere else after that) I dropped 2 blouses off and noticed they also fixed shoes. Came to pick up my blouses after the \""ready\"" date and only one was ready. I dropped off a shoe which I was told would be ready in a week. A week in a half later my boot isn't ready but my other blouse finally is. They say my shoe should be ready by Friday so I go Tuesday, still not ready. Long story short it took a month to get my shoe and every time I'd come in they would tell me it was ready and they were going to go pick it up. When it was finally ready they had a kid working the store who had no clue what he was doing."
26	1	a	I came to Queen Creek to visit my son and was thrilled to see kneaders Bakery & Cafe less than 2 miles from his home. I had never been to a Kneaders before, but I have to believe that management has to do with the poor food quality.  The sandwiches aren't cheep, but I will pay for a quality ingredients. Not so with the Ruben sandwich I bought. First thing I thought was 'where's the beef'?  I opened the sandwich to find 2 extra thin slices of pastrami in it!  Awful. I also ordered a broccoli soup and requested some cheddar cheese. The manager told me he didn't have any. Cut and dry! My order was to go so I didn't get to complain about the sandwich.  I also bought some pastries. The double chocolate brownie and chocolate chip cookies were good, as was the raspberry croissant.  But the chocolate croissant was terrible. There was a scant amount of chocolate in it!  Pastries were expensive. \n\nIf the manager thinks that his profit margin will be bigger by skimping on ingredients, he's in for a big surprise. I will not be going back!  I think a lot of people will feel the same way!
27	2	a	I just had a small dinner meeting in the private dining room. It was fantastic! Dinner was excellent. All of my guest gave it rave reviews. They especially loved the duck and the Wednesday special of fried chicken. The dessert cannot be missed! The private room was perfect. Not too loud at all. Our server, Chris, was funny and attentive! The whole evening went off beautifully. Thanks!
28	1	a	This place absolutely SUCKS!  It's super expensive for crappy food. The bartender doesn't know how to make a whiskey sour. The server I had was named buddy and he was crap too. Such an expensive place and they still hand you a to go box instead of doing it themselves. Real classy. What a horrible redone place. Beef eatery atleast was good.
29	2	a	We had a wonderful night here on my son's birthday. What made it so special was the great service that we had out of our waiter. Even though we were in a remote far-off corner of his outdoor patio on a chilly evening, he kept his eyes on us and we were never left wanting. [They have great heaters and they aren't afraid to use them.] The atmosphere is not as cool or charming as it could be -- I wish they'd spent a bit more to make the place look good. But, I did like the food, and that's what counts. I had a huge piece of pork tenderloin, and some great Mac 'n Cheese. While nothing is especially unique, their comfort food does just that . . . it gives you the feeling that someone who loves you just cooked you a home-cooked meal. I don't get that feeling in a restaurant very often. The next night we had dinner in another famous Phoenix restaurant (Tarbell's) and it was a let-down compared to this. When the waiter heard me reference my son's birthday, he brought out a large desert item which was enjoyed by all. A great experience! We were there on Arizona Wines night, and enjoyed a great bottle of Cochise Country white wine for half off. I like promotions like that.
30	2	a	Not bad! Not bad at all. Pretty expensive coffees/smoothies and other drinks but overall a pleasant experience for me. My bf and I waited 10-15 min before we got a table, and that was good for an extremely busy Saturday morning. I really enjoyed my hot chocolate, it was rich and tasty. My bf's smoothie tasted non diluted, not overly sweet and fresh. And of course, there were the cats! We sat near Gustave, a cat that was lounging around near our table at the corner. I really liked the fact that this cat cafe had nooks and crannies/crevices for for the cats to hide and sleep in. \n\nMy only complaint is that our food took FOREVER to get to your table. I think more than 45 min. It was crazy. I thought they forgot about us. However! My cat lady sandwich was excellent and the salad was tasty. It was a healthy menu and I appreciated that and the portion size not being too much. Nothing I hate more than huge huge portions.\n\nI would visit again for sure! And I recommend visiting here just to try something new if you're in the plateau area. Service was of course pretty decent as well,
31	2	a	"Compendium is a new show at Planet Hollywood in which musicians pay tribute to legendary bands featuring live music, multimedia and acting during breaks in sets/costume changes. \n\nThe first band they're paying tribute to is none other than KISS so when I heard that I was all about it. One of my friends who came to town is a huge KISS fan. I arranged to take him along with some other friends to see the show. My entire party had a rockin' good time!\n\nThe Sin City Theater at Planet Hollywood is on the smaller side but it makes for a more intimate show. Seating was comfortable and waitresses bring drinks directly to your table. As far as I could tell, there wasn't a bad seat in the house.\n\nSome of the classics played were \""Calling Dr. Love\"", \""I Was Made for Lovin' You\"", \""New York Groove\"", \""Lick It Up\"", \""Shout It Out Loud\"" and \""Rock and Roll All Nite\"".\n\nLuis Reyes does an amazing job as Gene Simmons! That tongue... geez! I was the lucky recipient of a guitar pick from him when he threw it to me. Thanks Luis!\n\nAt the end of the show, the band stayed out on the red carpet to take photos with fans which I thought was a really nice touch. The entire band was very personable and friendly.\n\nYou can see the Sin City KISS show now through June 30th. Tickets are available on Ticketmaster here:\n\nhttp://www.ticketmaster.com/Compendium-tickets/artist/1996989\n\nThe next band featured will be U2 starting July 3rd."
32	1	a	Stopped in with a friend for lunch. The lunch special prices ($7.99) were what really lured us in the door. It was a sadly mediocre experience.\n\nYou get a lot of food for your money, which I was excited about. But when I started eating my Pad Fresh Ginger, I noticed the flavors were all over the place. One bite was way too salty, another bite was funky. The quality of the chicken seemed to be pretty good, and was plentiful. But overall, it just tasted unpleasant and was very greasy. The lunch special came with a cup of soup and an egg roll. The soup tasted fine, but was only sparsely adorned with vegetables. The eggroll was a greasy, bland little nugget.\n\nMy friend ordered the Ka Pow, which was equally greasy and underwhelming. \n\nOur server was fine, and the space was inviting enough. Too bad the food was pretty forgettable. I would not recommend this place.
33	2	a	Since it has opened, Monsoon Siam has quickly become one of my favorites in the area, and it's now on my regular visit rotation. Although their service is good, the staff is nice, and the prices are reasonable, I keep coming back here for two main reasons: The dishes, and how fast they come to the table.\n\nConcerning the food: There's a lot more variety on the menu than one would expect. Some of the specials are interesting and unique concoctions, like the lemongrass tofu and tofu angel. Otherwise, there's a lot of classics to choose from as well, like the Pad Thai, and the selection of curries. One aspect I really like is that in the dishes where you can choose your protein, you can pick a tofu BALL, which is different from your regular old tofu in that it's deep-fried and packed with herbs. I very much recommend trying those at least once.\n\nAnd all of this food comes to you FAST. Like I put in an order with 1 other person, and the dishes came to us in 4 minutes. It's almost too fast, because it makes me wonder if they're even made to order. But they're delicious regardless, so who cares? The speed of the service always makes me consider Monsoon Siam when i'm in a pinch for time and am feeling too lazy to cook.\n\nWith all that said, I can say that even if you think that there's too many Thai places in Madison, Monsoon Siam is still well worth your time to check out.
34	2	a	"THANK YOU cool yelp eliters for guiding me to yet another wonderful spot. I've passed this on Atwood but it never stood out enough to convince me to take a night off of my usual Thai places.\n\nThe reviews all are correct - the food here is fantastic. It's super casual so it's somewhere I would go if you're really just looking to treat your taste buds for a low key dinner. I want to try ordering delivery, but the fees are such that I would probably only do it with a large group. Here are some of the highlights:\n\nTom Kha soup: this coconut broth soup is a favorite of mine and something I use to compare Thai restaurants because it usually doesn't vary so much. Monsoon Siam probably served the most unique version I've ever tasted; it was tangy and I want to say citrusy! I also liked that you could order mushrooms with this instead of the usual tofu or chicken. \n\nSun dried beef: ordered this because of a yelp review that claimed people \""sing praises\"" to this dish. After one bite, we were singing praises. It's sooo flavorful and not overly dry! A lot of food for $7, easy to share with at least 3 people.\n\nRed curry: spicy (be warned if you can't take the heat) without losing the inherent flavor of the dish. Very brothy, which I personally prefer. I got the tofu because of a yelper who said they don't typically love tofu but this tofu is an exception. I totally agree; the texture is sophisticated and it really takes the flavor of the dish.\n\nPad see ew: fluffy noodles! Great with tofu. My friend who ordered this was so happy!\n\nMy friend is a huuuuge Ha Long Bay guy, and admitted that Monsoon Siam's food is better! Can't wait to come back and try more!"
35	2	a	This is hands-down the best frozen yogurt place I've ever been to. The yogurt flavors aren't too tart and they have a really great taste; they're also organic. The staff is super friendly, there's an abundance of toppings, the store is kept very clean, and they give a discount to police officers. This was a great place to stumble upon.
36	1	a	"I'm giving this location 1 star because the service is horrible!!  The yogurt is yummy, but every time I have gone the lady working at the register has been very disconnected and unfriendly!!  A number of times the door has been locked and the store hours say open.. And though I have gone at 11 am everyday and it's usually open, last week the door was locked again at 11:30; she came to the door, peaked out and said \""what??\"" I said id like some yogurt... She said we don't open until 12:30 now!  I asked why it had suddenly changed and she said it hasn't had much business before then and then she just shut the door..no smile nothing!!  I usually love sincerely yogurts, but this location is by far the worst as far as friendly employees!!!  :/ I wouldn't recommend coming here because the doors may not be open !!"
37	1	a	I was so hopeful to find a good BBQ place. I heard great things about this place but wanted to wait until the lines went down from it being new. Well, I am so sad. Shared a brisket and a turkey sandwich along with sides of coleslaw, potato salad and a cobbler with my mom. \nThere was a really bad propane taste to the turkey.  The brisket was ok. Not anything to rave about. The BBQ sauce you add yourself at the table, which the spouts were clogged.  \nNow I really thought that they would have some good potato salad and coleslaw being a BBQ place. I was very wrong.  Not homemade.  Tasted like any store bought deli products.  Ewe. \nI guess that I had high hopes for the cobbler. Was kinda scared to try it after the salads. Yep disappointed.  I have actually had better frozen store bought. \nI hate to do a bad review but really if the food was better I'd totally give it a great review.  I think the whole concept they have is cool and the decorations are totally western BBQ cool. Even the patio for when it cools down would be great.  But you don't go there for the decorations.
38	1	a	"Well....the chocolate pudding was good!  \n\nThis place has a lot of hype surrounding it and despite being an enormous fan of the Austin style BBQ joint in Phoenix, Little Miss BBQ (see my review and all the other 5-star reviews surrounding it), I was willing to give it a shot.  \n\nThe line didn't bug me and I was ready to wait knowing this is how Texas style BBQ is, but just know you will wait a bit because of the way they slice and serve their food.  My hubby and two friends and I grabbed one of the metal buckets and filled it with yeasty beverages while we waited.  \n\nLet me just preface this entire review now (as if the first sentence didn't already cover it)...I have two simple words to describe it.  Dry. Bland. Dry. Bland. Dry. Bland. Dry. Bland.  Does that about cover it?\n\nWe decided on half a pound each of the pork spare ribs, fatty brisket, and one house made jalapeno sausage along with some coleslaw, beans, and chocolate pudding.  The coleslaw was insanely bland.  What am I talking about?!  The entire tray of meat was everything but flavorful.  \n\nAs soon as they put the ribs on our tray, I turned to my husband and asked him, \""What the heck is that?\""  It was gray and looked like cardboard.  The fatty brisket they laid down was a lousy excuse for fatty brisket.  As a brisket expert, my husband realized their \""fatty brisket\"" is actually the lower part of the point, which is dry and normally chopped and served on sandwiches because it isn't pretty and it certainly isn't fatty.  The link looked hopeful though.  I totally dug the hot carrots!!!  \n\nSo, Texas BBQ is supposed to not require any sauce at all.  But this stuff had to be doused in it!  I had to bathe my meat in it for goodness sakes.  There was absolutely no flavor to any of the meat and no seasoning (and by that I mean salt and pepper) in sight.  \n\nNever will I ever go back to Rudy's.  And I am NOT just writing this subpar review because of LMB...I honestly and truthfully was grossed out and extremely let down by the appearance, taste, and lackluster flair of their food. Sure Little Miss BBQ is a bit more of a drive, but their meat is juicy, flavorful, and doesn't require any sauce whatsoever.  Their sides are tasty too."
39	1	a	While their BBQ is pretty good, the little breakfast burritos they make in the morning are not.\n\nI ordered about six of these greasy things to share with my coworkers and felt sick the rest of the day.\n\nI am pretty sure they gave me the scoots.\n\nAvoid their breakfast, because the food will make you sick and regretful.
40	2	a	This place is great. Clean with an open space atmosphere. The friendly staff will walk you through the process of ordering and give you free samples to try.\n\nThe moist brisket was awesome. It's fatty meaty goodness didn't need sauce but i appreciate that its there. \n\nWill be back for sure!
41	2	a	On my monthly trip around the state of Arizona I tend to stay in Goodyear once a month.  I keep finding my way back to Rudy's.  They don't advertise gluten free but do have a lot of choices for any allergies.  Ask at the front desk they have a laminated allergy menu,  including dairy,  soy,  gluten and sulfites too.  Food is great.   I have tried the ribs,  sausages,  brisket,  potato salad and the cole slaw.  They have real food and always fill me up.  I have never been disappointed here.   I love the Chandler location too.   Will happily return.
42	1	a	"Tried Rudy's for the first time tonight. Food was good, not great, and we weren't impressed with the \""share-a-table-with-your-neighor\"" atmosphere.  Eating with no plates was a bit odd as was the single slice of plain sandwich bread we received with all the meat we ordered. We aren't barbecue connesuers, though, so maybe this is normal? We'll definitely opt for other BBQ restaurants before returning here."
43	2	a	"I'm from Southern California and more specifically the 626 area (aka asian food central).  Super shocked to see a pretty busy boba place in the food court at the mall in Arizona.  My curiosity decided to give it a try.\n\nFirst off, their menu is SUPER overwhelming.  I'm definitely on the indecisive side when it comes to ordering anything, but they have so many different categories of \""teas\"" such as Flirteas (fruity flavors), Naughteas (creamy flavors), etc. It's a fun concept for each drink to have a cool name, but it took me a while to decipher that menu.  I do like how they have three options for sizes of drinks.\n\nCLUELESS: This Flirtea drink was made with guava, watermelon, lemon, strawberry, and green.  It normally comes with lychee jelly (or \""gobi\"" as they called it here), but I switched it out for boba without any charge.  Flavor and their quality of boba was surprisingly pretty good!!\n\nGOLDEN TEA BOBA: I think this was a make your own kind of tea option. Could not find it on their menu lol, shows how complicated it is.  Was recommended this and it totally reminds me of Lollicup's milk tea haha. \n\nPlenty of options and they can also adjust the amount sweetness per request.  What's unique here that I don't see often is that they have options for sweeteners in your drinks (i.e.: agave, honey, etc.) A little on the pricey side because it's in a nice mall, but that's expected."
44	1	a	"I ordered a blush with Boba my first time here. Let me tell you, I am never going back again. It tasted bitter and it was very chunky at the top and watery at the bottom. This place is always packed and I waited 10 minutes in line for disappointment. I recommend going to a place called \""the street\"" in Mesa az. It might be a little further but they are worth it."
45	1	a	"I was looking forward to eating here after reading about it online and in the newspaper, but was sadly disappointed.  Made special trip to Red Rock casino to try it out on Saturday June 28.  It was pretty empty, especially for a weekend.  My husband ordered a polish dog, and was very disappointed they don't have sauerkraut.  I originally ordered a coney dog and was disappointed they don't serve chili.  I have never heard of a hot dog place that doesn't serve sauerkraut and chili!  Anyway, I ended up ordering the dogs in a blanket.  We shared an order of fries and got two sodas, and our tab came to $27 and change, which is ridiculous for hotdogs, even in a Vegas (off Strip) casino.  I wouldn't have minded the cost if the food was as good as the Pinks (which was formerly in this location) or Nathan's, but it wasn't.  The \""blanket\"" portion of my dogs in a blanket was undercooked, and my food tasted like hot dogs wrapped in raw dough.  The fries tasted as though they  had been prepared in old grease and were limp and oily.  My husband said his polish dog was decent, yet he was still disappointed it had no kraut.  I will say the worker who delivered our food to the table was friendly, although the woman who took our order not so much.  I wish Pinks had never left this location, they were so much better!   Anyway, we feel we paid too much for subpar food and will not be back."
46	1	a	Really wanted them to do better in the new location. The built out of the restaurant is done quite well so we were looking forward to a nice dinner. The best thing to hit the table that night was unfortunately the bread. We ordered Spaghetti & Meatballs (bland).....Chicken Parm (driest Chicken ever and why do they put Ricotta on the Parm).....the other two dishes were so flavorless that I already forgot what they were....honestly the other hospitals provide better food.\nYou can tell they spent a lot of money to create a nice atmosphere if they had a cook to match this place could be very succesful despite the prices.
47	1	a	"Annie's has many of the makings of a high end restaurant such as the prices and ambiance, besides that, it is sorely lacking. My girlfriend and I were seated immediately with the restaurant fairly busy. We were both surprised at how nice the interior was; dimly lit with old photos of the owners in their 1950s prime. It was very nice and felt welcoming.\n\nThen the problems started. It took at least 12-15 minutes for our waiter to come by (granted, someone came by to say he'd be by \""soon\"" and that they were very busy), but when he did, he walked up, said hello and introduced himself, then he went to go check to see if we were his table, then came back and said he'd be back in a minute and went five feet away to a table that had been seated after us and took their drink orders. It was absolutely ridiculous. Almost laughable. We didn't order drinks solely for that reason.\n\nWhen he finally did come by, we just wanted to order and eat since we were starving. Following that, it was another 15 minutes of waiting before we got bread (we had to ask). I ordered the chicken parmigiano and my girlfriend ordered the potato gnocci. The gnocci was great and being as famished as I was, I was so excited to eat my meal, only to be completely let down. The first bite of the chicken I spit out. I don't do that, but I had to. It was this chewy, rubbery texture that I thought was fat. It turned out the entire chicken was pretty much the same consistency. We deduced that it was a really cheap cut of chicken. At least it wasn't under cooked (which I thought it was at first). Regardless, it was almost inedible. Oh and $7 to split the check? Not that we needed to, but good god that's ridiculous. \n\nI just moved to town and I really wanted to like Annie's, but I saw little charm or reason to ever visit again despite the decor, which, unfortunately, you cannot eat.\n\nOne star is harsh, but I think in our case, it is completely warranted. If anyone had eaten the chicken I did or waited the length we did for literally anything that a restaurant should do as soon as you sit down, you would think the same."
48	1	a	"Service was great. Food was horrible. DO NOT order any of the \""chicken\"" dishes. It was flavorless & had a very odd texture...rubbery & just plain not appetizing. \nThe Caesar salad wasn't even that great.  \nMy husband & I will not be returning to this establishment. The server was awesome though. Very accommodating."
49	1	a	"Oh goodness. Really wished the new location was going to change the service and maybe the menu or at least add some \""wow\"" flavor to it. I don't want to knock Grandma's recipes but... Meh. So much space and now an actual bar! Still not used properly. The chicken is from Costco or Sam's club which is fine but do something with it! The \""mixed veggies\"" were also from either establishment and totally bland as well. C'mon man. \n\nThe chef came out to a couple tables but not ours or I would've asked if there was going to be any updates coming (hopeful thinking). Doesn't seem to have kept the old folk crowd from showing up but if that's the crowd you're aiming for then fine but why move farther away from Macdonald Ranch? \n\nPro-tip: Update the menu and servers. Don't purchase your ingredients from Costco. \n\nAlso to the plate splitting charge.... Make the dishes BIGGER, then and ONLY then should you be allowed to enforce a plate splitting charge."
50	1	a	Brews Brothers ... a play on the Blues Brothers ...  I came in with a party of 6 only to find high top tables for 2 or 4 ... no problem, we just pushed 2 together.\n\nThe 1st two tap beers I ordered they were out of ...  +40 beers ... I hope they are keeping their lines clean ...\n\nOrdered a water to find the straw was about an inch short of the top of the glass.\n\nFood ... Burgers, turkey burger, pulled pork ... those are your choices ... no other options all burgers cooked to well done.\n\nThey have a handful of sides including home made chips (which were a bit rubbery) and hand cut fries (which were like mash potato sticks; they needed to be cooked a lot longer).\n\nThe burger was decent as long as you are okay with well done.  If you need a fork you have to ask for one (oh and it is a plastic fork).\n\nmy recommendations:\n\n1.  take out some tables.  it was jammed full of tables and chairs, making it supper hard to walk around the place.\n2. If you are going to only offer well done burgers you might was well have a slow cooker full of done burgers to help speed up the process.\n3. the fryers have to be to small for the volume of fries and chips they need to make (this is why they are mushy).\n4. They need other menu items.  How about chicken or a salad?\n\nRight now it is at about dive bar status ...
51	2	a	Ashley at Bella Bronze of Las Vegas is absolutely amazing! I've always been a little skeptical about spray tans, but she totally proved me wrong. The color goes on evenly, it takes care of my terrible tan lines, and it gives me that natural sun-kissed look that everyone desires. It will not make you look orange or fake, and Ashley will give you all of the tips to help maintain your tan for as long as possible. The great thing about the spray tans is that they come in three different shades - light, medium, and dark, so you have a lot of flexibility in the kind of look that you want to achieve. Her prices are very affordable, and I recommend her to anyone who is looking for a spray tan!
52	2	a	1. Pillows aren't that bad, not sure what everyone uses at home but I've had way worse. I have a tempur-pedicure at home so you know I'm picky about pillows.\n\n2. The whole pet issue - you are in Vegas why the hell are you brining your pet?! I could understand if you were road tripping it but honestly I don't think you are. It's called a pet sitter check into it, plus leaving your pet in a room all day while you party it up isn't cool. Your pet doesn't need to go everywhere with you, we left ours behind. \n\n3. We only had hot scalding water in our shower, huge problem which is why I gave 4 stars. Called and asked for it to be fixed and it was in a very reasonable amount of time. Politeness counts, remember that. \n\n4. Noise, as far as that goes the a/c hums but that's it. I'm a really light sleeper and so far I don't see there being any issues. \n\n5. The person who complained about closet space should have opened the other side. Surprise it's full length and had an iron and ironing board. The smaller side has a safe, which is always a plus. My dress is hanging just fine and is wrinkle free.\n\n6. Mini bar, they are always over priced. If you don't want to spend $6 on water then bring your own. But if you have ever been to a hotel before in your life you should know this. Complaint denied. \n\n7. Entrance isn't hard to find, it's right next to the Mandalay Bay entrance in the parking garage. There is also a sign that says Delano.\n\n\nThis is our first night out of 3, so far it's been really nice. The only bad thing is the weather, it's raining with thunderstorms but the hotel can't control that.
53	1	a	I cannot believe this place charges for valet. I come to Vegas almost every other month for business and/or pleasure and have never paid a nickel in my life for parking in vegas. Plus, after paying that steep $ just for parking, they never charged our Tesla after we made the long trek from Orange County. We rolled into town with 50 miles left on our battery and told valet to please charge the car. They promised to do so, but almost 3 hours later, I check on my car with my app and find out they never touched it, let alone charge it. Then, I wasn't comfortable driving out around town to dinner and whatever because of the low battery. \n\nOther than valet problems, decor is new, rooms redone cosmetically, and that's about it. I don't know if I would bother staying here again in the future when there are so many other better options in Vegas.
54	1	a	This is a bit different review then the rest.  \n\nWe rented it out for a christmas party for our group.  They had drinks, food, space and music.  It was a great space the food was actually amazing, truffle fries, mini burgers, stuffed mushrooms and more.  The food was replenished often and kept warm on hot plates.\n\nIt was a drink ticket night, I am cool with that but the bartender was insanely conservative.  By the way I used to serve at the races in january so I know the deal. I felt like he added a thimble of booze to each drink, he would take a empty plastic glass (at least pour into a shot glass and pour a bit of booze into my glass.  Not as many people showed up so most people had many extra tickets.  Needless to say I was sober even though I had a sober driver.\n\nCome on add a tiny bit of extra booze not just to the line and if you are worried about your bosses getting mad.  My past bartending experience is you pour your drinks over ice to make it look like there is more not into an empty cup when my mind stays sober.  Mind over matter...
55	2	a	The customer service and staff are unbelievablely nice. so helpful and with glowing smiles. They offer advice and suggestions. Had the Skinny juice....Oh my goodness was it the BEST!!! They also offer a nice selection of vegan treats etc. A must see.
56	1	a	Ordered two simple burgers.\nAn original with only lettuce, mayonnaise and American cheese. And a veggie burger with only lettuce, mayonnaise, tomatoes and cheese.\nWe got an original with tomatoes and onions and a veggie with onions and no cheese. \nEnded up being the driest and most terrible burger I've had. Should have asked for my money back, go anywhere but here for a burger -__-
57	2	a	I have never, in the 20 years that I've been getting pedicures, had an experience like this. I had come to accept mediocre in the past...Lish goes above and beyond in EVERY WAY! Most importantly, they took their time, and actually removed ALL the dead skin. They are super friendly, highly professional, offer you a beverage when you arrive, and do a SUPERB job! I am super excited to have a salon like this close to home, they will be seeing me regularly!!!!! (this coming from someone who never posts reviews!)
58	1	a	US air solutions LLC = US Air Services \n480-994-1304 - as they have the same address it would appear!\n\nSo. My fiance said they stuck the vacuums in. Took about 30 mins and left. They took the grills off and brushes that but didn't brush out the vents at all. It is not a 300$ value in our opinion. We could have stuck a vacuum in ourselves. That's all they did.\n\nThis entire process has been ridiculously difficult and we are incredibly unhappy so we won't be using their services in the future. The Amazon deal was to pay $50 for a $298 service.\n\nFirst of all I was able to make the appointment with someone (that said eco air?)  but someone else called me multiple times only once leaving me a message - in that message stating I could not have the appointment (5 days before my appointment that I made 3 weeks prior). I confirmed with the guy from the email that my appointment with still on yet I received multiple phone calls after that. I finally called back not knowing who us air was and they told me that the technician could not come out between the scheduled time and did not have any other options really for me that were convenient. I also did not appreciate the way I was asked why someone wouldn't be around at 3 p.m. In the afternoon to which I replied that most people are working during that time.\n\nI told the girl that I would call her back and asked my fiance to call because I needed to get back to work. They left him on hold for a very long time and he decided to hang up. Today we received  a phone call from the technician stating that he could be on his way in 20 minutes and it was 230 in the afternoon. \nAfter they arrived they asked about the voucher and stated that it was only a $50 voucher and therefore there were certain services they would not do. I told my fiance that the voucher was $50 yes but the value was 298 dollars.\n\nSo after the ridiculous scheduling debacle I guess I shouldn't be surprised they didn't really know what they were supposed to be doing when they came to my house. They also for some reason plugged into an extension cord I had and almost immediately blew the circuit.\n\nThey ONLY vacuumed and brushes the vents - a $50 service according to the tech. He kept saying we only paid $50 so that was all we were getting. Which is funny, because it was worth $298. REALLY? So - I guess we got what we paid for. A few days later the company US AIR called to ask if the tech had come to visit. Why does no one know what each other is doing?\n\nStay away!
59	2	a	Even though the situation was less then favorable, Chase went above and beyond to help make the situation amazing for us!!!! So sweet, and understanding he truly made this not favorable time great! As an employer you should feel blessed to have such a hardworking, passionate, customer service driven young man!!
60	2	a	"I love this place! Walk in, place your order, take your number to the table, grab your beverage, and they will deliver your delicious order to your table.\n  \nThe left side of the menu is the healthier stuff and the right side is the \""cheat day\"" not as healthy stuff. Great outdoor patio dining with lots of seating. The food is consistent and the employees are always happy and helpful. They are always cleaning and on top of things. The vibe and artwork make this place unique and set it apart from your everyday boring chain style dining. Prices are affordable and food is addictive and tasty. Thumbs up!!! : ) Favorites are Slow Boat to China and the Flat Chix and Greens. \n\n\n\nYes, the salt and pepper shakers are adorable.  They have legs and choose not to run away so leave them on the tables where they live.  Let me say this again, don't be a scumbag and steal the salt and pepper shakers...buy your own!\n\nThey have a delicious looking kids menu for the little ones."
61	2	a	"Crazy menu, but it works.  Everyone is very friendly greeting you when you arrive and when you leave.  Food was delivered quick and best of all was the Charlie Brown Shake (Nutella and Banana). \n\nAs Arnold says, \""I'LL BE BACK!!!\"""
62	2	a	Great non typical fast food.  Had the Nice to Greek You order and it was very good although not exactly filling.  The side salad I thought was too small.  The choice of ice teas was also good.  Communal big table was OK, not thrilled with it.   Staff was friendly.  Overall  a great experience will be back for at least a second time.
63	1	a	Went there on a Thursday night. Pool room was filled but restaurant area was empty. Try to get a drink at both bars and had to wait very very long each time. It even took 10 minutes just to close out. Probably not coming back anytime soon
64	1	a	Went with a large group on a Friday evening. The group reserved the entire back area so we could be together. The restaurant only had two people assigned our area (we had at least 100 people and over 15 tables). We personally waited 15 minutes just to get our drink order then we placed our food order and waited well over an hour for our food. By the time we received our food several of the tables in our group decided to leave and go to the Cook Out to get better service and actually have their dinner after finding out that the order they had placed over an hour earlier hadn't even been started yet in the kitchen!!! The management knew we were coming well in advance yet chose to schedule a light staff in the dining room and in the kitchen. The food was mediocre at best and I only gave it one star because zero stars was not an option.
65	1	a	FYI... I did a delivery order. \n\nI ordered:\n\nPho Tai: broth was okay but wtf happened to the noodles? When I poured the soup into the noodles they didn't separate. So I started to stir it around and then the noodles starting breaking and it became blocks of noodles. \n\nTom yum: I asked for it to be hot and I swear it was less than mild. It wasn't even sour so it tasted like watered down tom yum. Plus I thought it was weird they used cherry tomatoes.\n\nSpring rolls: $6 for two spring rolls and you're only going to put one shrimp split in half in each spring roll? Then stuff the rest with lettuce and noodles? I feel like they just robbed my money after I ate that. \n\nThai tea: was just thai tea. Really sweet. \n\nTotal was $28 plus tip.
66	2	a	Lyft is a great alternative to driving. When I plan on having a few drinks, I always use Lyft to get there and safely back home again. Their prices are reasonable and all of their drivers are friendly. Some drivers offer free water, candy, phone chargers, and let you change the radio station. I had a driver once who had baked cookies and they were fresh and delish. I had another driver with a free wifi hotspot in his car. They are usually available around the clock and I usually don't have to wait more than 10 minutes for them to arrive. It's a pleasure to ride in a Lyft. I can't say that about any other form of transportation in Phoenix. (except it's kind of fun to ride the light rail once in a while)\nClean Cars!!! \nGreat Drivers!!! \nGreat Personalities!!! \nGreat Company!!! \nAfter the ride, you get to give your driver a 5 Star Rating.
67	2	a	Took a group of 15 and the waitress just served us what she thought we might want. Awesome experience. Bacon Jam has changed my life.
68	2	a	Very capable of 5 stars, and once things are operating a little more smoothly, this will be one of my favorites! Great food & amibience. The Devil's Eggs were incredibly good, as was the wild mushroom flatbread. My Mac & Cheese serving was really tiny, but I couldn't eat more than a few bites after appetizers, even though it was excellent. The one dish we all agreed needs to go was the black rice risotto. They really should paint the roof beams charcoal or silver; they really look like what they are rather than a nice open beam feel.
69	2	a	Was amazingly surprised. The seating was tight but for our party of 6 including CrossFit Athlete Cheryl Brost and her Husband Troy this was a great Dinner.\nTwo words: Bacon Jam. WOW WOW  WOW - The Deviled Eggs were excellent as well\nThe Beer selection was too different for my standard, Pyrate or Duval but they were fun to explore new labels I never heard of. The Design of the place is amazing and we all polished our plates with 100% satisfaction - Leave room for dessert cause Kerry Simons Carson Kitchen will leave an impression on your appetite and Heart. Bravo!!
70	2	a	The first time I had food from here, I didn't even have to go here. Food just fell on my lap and it was forkin glorious. The first time I actually went here, I was a bit lost since I'm kind of blind even with my hipster glasses on. It's right next door to O Face Doughnuts. I've also been here for my post-workout birthday lunch and a few other times...all because of a bowl of vegetables!\n\nChicken:\nChicken thigh that's simple but tasty. The skin is crisp but not overcooked. It's quite juicy. I paired this with their broccoli which was a bit spicy 4.5/5\n\nRainbow Cauliflower:\nThis is my favorite item on the menu. I never thought I'd say that the best dish I've had was a bowl of veggies let alone cauliflower! What crazy friggin ish is that? As a matter of fact, I crave a bowl all the time now. Garlicky, a bit of spice and a bit citrusy. I could eat this all day. A glowing 5/5\n\nCocoa-Espresso NY Strip Steak:\nTender slices of beef with pink on the middle. Earthy and nutty because of the cocoa espresso but without being bitter. 4/5\n\nSwordfish: \nFlaky white fish with lemon, mint and basil. Refreshing, light and delicious 5/5\n\nYoung Beets:\nI don't normally get too crazy over beets. The texture is mushy and tastes like dirt - CK was able to make me like beets. 4/5\n\nGyro Tacos:\nGreek tacos with tender meat, feta and onions. Nothing complicated here. 4/5\n\nChicken Skin:\nComes with honey to dip the crunchy salty goodness that is chicken skin. Forget your healthy eating habits for a moment and indulge in this basket of magnificence. *crunch crunch crunch crack crack crack* was all I heard when this was brought to our table. 5/5\n\nTomato Stack:\nCaprese salad, basically. 4/5\n\nMac n Cheese:\nI don't know how they made such a simple comfort food to be better than most places. The crispy top, the creamy cheese sauce...yuuuummm!!! 5/5\n\nDevil's Eggs:\nDeviled eggs with caviar and pancetta. Absolutely delicious. With the caviar and pancetta, I thought this would be salty but I was wrong. Different textures in my mouth. 4.5/5\n\nThey have a few tables by the window, a few stools by the kitchen and by the bar, and a community table. They also have outdoor seating. This is one of my favorite spots in Downtown Las Vegas.
71	2	a	This little place is a gem! Great intimate, social friendly space with a lot of charm. The staff is VERY friendly and the menu is simple and comforting with a flare of flavors. We did not have reservations, but were seated right away. Our table was attached to the bar, sat a total of 10 people and was used for couples and singles. A great way to meet and talk with fellow diners if you feel like being social, but still plenty of space if you're not feeling it. We had the Crispy Chicken Skins with roasted honey (a MUST have) to start. For our entrees we chose the Swordfish and NY Strip Steak. The steak was cooked PERFECTLY and the red wine demi sauce added to without overpowering the natural flavor of the meat. The swordfish with lemon, mint & basil was FANTASTIC!! We also had the baked mac & cheese (unsolicited compliments of the house due to the wait time for our entrees). I highly recommend Carson Kitchen and will definitely be back to try the other items on the menu. Bacon Jam, Chicken Thighs and Roasted Beets are on the list for our next visit.
72	2	a	The food here is so damn good.  The bacon jam is good on almost anything.  The sliders have so much flavor.  The donut bread-pudding was sinfully delicious.  You meet cool people here.  It doesn't appear to seat a lot so I recommend a reservation for weekends.  I wish they had a bigger menu because the flavors are WOW.
73	2	a	The food and service here is delicious and straight to the point! I can't rave enough on what an incredible dining experience we had here. Another yelper commented on how the restaurant and ambiance reminded them of being in San Francisco and I agree. I definitely didn't feel like I was in Vegas anymore. I loved the restaurant's quaint and modern design but I especially enjoyed the charming ambiance on their roof top dining area, the booths were very comfortable and there was just the right amount of lighting too. \n \nNow, let's get to the good stuff: the food! \n \nThe crispy chicken skins arrived with a side of smoked honey for dipping = insane! Honey Boo Boo, this thing is real good! The skins were seasoned expertly and fried to crazy, crispy perfection; I couldn't get enough of that airy, crunchy skin - it wasn't even oily. Don't even get me started on the smoked honey -delectable- you can bet your sweet life they were meant to be eaten together. It's a must-order and for $6, the portion was perfect for two.\n \nWe also went all in on the bacon jam with baked brie and grilled baguette at $12, It's the most popular item on the menu and now I know why. It came out bubbling hot and was incredibly bacon-y, jam-y, brie-y, salty, sweet and, yes, it was pretty darn magical.\n \nTo offset the naughtiness that is crispy chicken skins and bacon jam, we also ordered roasted young beets with pistachio, mandarin orange slices and goat cheese at $8. The beets were roasted till perfect tenderness, naturally sweet, and the dish was simple but very tasty. It was the perfect option to complement the richness of the bacon jam.\n \nWe also grabbed an order of the black rice and oxtail risotto with Parmesan cream for $14, though, we thought it was way too cheesy (if that's even a problem?) Based on the menu description, we were expecting more of a smoother Parmesan cream-like consistency, but we ended up with more of a dense, stringy texture. Our waitress was wonderful and could tell that we weren't too thrilled with the consistency when she checked on us, so she generously offered to replace the dish with something else that we would be able to enjoy. We decided on the rabbit ragu with spaghetti squash and Parmesan at $12 - everything on this dish was seasoned very well; I also really enjoyed the light tomato cream sauce and the perfectly cooked spaghetti squash. Surprisingly, the overall dish wasn't too heavy. I personally wouldn't order it again, (rabbit is just not my thing) but my boyfriend went to town on it and really enjoyed it. \n \nI'm completely satisfied with the level of service and care that we were offered here. They went above and beyond to make sure we were happy with everything we ordered, plus the simply tasty food is well worth a quick return! I can't wait to come back and order some more of those chicken skins all to myself!
74	2	a	Great food and great vibe. The staff is very trendy, but also knowledgeable. The Mac n Cheese and the Gyro Tacos were probably the highlight for me. I wasn't a fan of the Cauliflower dish... It sort of tasted like grilled veggies doused in lemon juice. Overall, a great experience and I would definitely go back.
75	2	a	Trendy place located downtown Las Vegas.  Fun plates tapas style to share if you are having lunch.  I didn't have dinner there yet but it is on my list of places for dinner.  Being that I am a big fan of Kerry Simon, I can't say one thing negative.  It was good food, reasonably priced and fun atmosphere.  We sat at the bar that surrounded the prep area.  I would definitely recommend this to the tourist visiting the area as well as the locals.
76	2	a	This could've gone gimmicky but instead it's a fun little watering hole with tasty, strong drinks and fabulous service. Had a round of the eponymous cocktail at the bar and was impressed by the bartender's execution and presentation. Fun unique little spot - grab a seat at the bar, it got busy fast even on a weeknight.
77	1	a	"THE INTRO:\n--Despite my low two-star rating attributed to this restaurant, I would point out that it is a brand-new restaurant and they may be still working out some of the kinks.  I would consider this as you read my review.  We were at the restaurant for 2.5 hours.  My goal when deciding on a restaurant this evening was to dine with a couple (2) of friends that just wanted to have a nice sit-down meal to celebrate someone's birthday.  We ultimately chose this restaurant because it was new, had done some great marketing, and there was a lot of hype about the quality of the food, the d\u00e9cor and the location.\n\nTHE GOOD:\n--the d\u00e9cor is great - walls made out of solid concrete with a cool fireplace (it's not real fire, but very cool nonetheless), comfortable seats, a couple of wine cellars, soft lighting but still strong enough to see everything nicely, and a winding staircase going up to the second floor; and\n--the quality of the steak - it was cooked just the way I ordered (rare) and had a wonderful charcoal-tasting sear on the outside.  Contrary to another poster, the steak was not drenched in salt.\n\nTHE BAD:\n--speed of kitchen service - anything that we ordered from the kitchen (whether that was a snack, appetizer, main dish, or dessert) took a long time to arrive.  Excessively long.  We ordered a bottle of wine to accompany our main meal (we had had martinis with the snacks, etc., before the main meal).  The waitress brought over the bottle (Penfolds Bin 9) immediately after the main meal was ordered and, amazingly, we managed to finish off the bottle of wine before the steak arrived!  We didn't \""chug\"" back the wine, either: we took our time.  Service was equally slow for the starters\n--I feel bad saying this, but our waitress just didn't seem to fit in this calibre of restaurant--there was just something about her service that was a little \""off\"" by the comments that she made to us during the meal and her general demeanor came off as a bit \""brusque\"";\n--the quality of the starters - we ordered smoked cheese fritters and Japanese dumplings.  The dumplings were warm, not hot.  The quality was only okay.  Unfortunately, in a place like this, \""okay\"" doesn't cut it.  You'll see why in the next line; and\n--the quality / quantity / price ratios (le rapport qualit\u00e9-prix) - the bill came out to $100 / person but the size of the dishes (quantity) and the taste of the food (quality - except for the steak which was great) just didn't justify the price, and that's taking into consideration the nice d\u00e9cor."
78	2	a	The desserts here are absolutely great! Yes, few--very, very few--may not be to my liking, as in the taro snow fluff, (red beans are a little too sweet for my taste), but you can't always expect to love everything anywhere. Anyway, I've gone here more times than I should've the past month, but each time that I have the staff & owner are always so friendly and extremely generous. I always feel so welcomed whenever they remember my face! Not only is service fantastic but, as mentioned before, the desserts are absolutely yummy! Lol. My favorite snow fluff is the honeydew--which, by the way isn't on the menu yet ;) --and I love to get it with strawberry ice cream! Lol. Eating here is a great way to cool down, especially with summer about to kick us in the face, hahaha. And with their large-sized portions, there's no way anyone could ever stay hot in this weather. I'd say you get what you pay for, and sometimes more! \n\nAlso, this place is a chill spot to hang out. They have a few games on their shelves you can play while eating up your desserts. So not only do you get to enjoy your food but you get to have a fun time while eating as well! :) \n\nThis place is seriously my new favorite spot to hit at night, especially since they're open 'til 1am, (YAAAAAS! LOL). I wish them the best with their business!
79	2	a	Loved the ambience. The boba was ok I only wished that the milk tea was boiled instead of powder. Didn't get to taste the dessert but looked so amazing and the snow ice looks fantastic ! The workers were very pleasant and very wiling to accommodate me and customized the sweetness of my milk tea.
80	1	a	I wasnt particularly fond of ice monster cafe. Their interior is pretty nice and comfortable but for quality drinks and snow ice I wasnt impressed. Prices for a small flavored ice was $5 which is served in a very tiny martini glass, large is about $10. I ordered the taro slush sensation, and a friend of mine got the thai tea, green tea float, and mango slush sensation. The thai tea wasnt good at all from what he told me, first he tried it with their sea salt cream foam, but it was too light and then with regular half and half cream. It looked very watered down and he said it was bland tasting. As for his greet tea macha float, he had described as floral traditional green tea but stronger. It didnt honestly look too good, like green water and a plop of ice cream melting in it, like a water float. My snow ice sensation was very bland, the ice cream scoop in it was good but the snow had very little to no taro taste at all; very watered down, and the texture was not fluffy but more of a crushed freezer ice texture, not worth 5 bucks in my opinion. The mango sensation was good and for a large was very decently sized, that was the only redeeming order of that day. The workers were pretty nice but not very helpful or knowledgeable at all on their products, it was more like ordering from a vending machine with no personality or presence unfortunately. I dont think I will ever be back but if I do return, maybe next visit will be better.
81	1	a	I'm so upset. I usually come just for the sea foam milk tea.. And they took it off the menu. Whyyyyy????
82	1	a	When this place first opened, my husband, friends, and I really enjoyed it. The food was great, especially the macaroni and cheese. The atmosphere was what you'd expect when going to a nice dinner out. However, I am not sure what has happened in the last few months. Apparently due to a change in management they have cut their menu down drastically taking away some of the better options, including the macaroni and cheese and salmon BLT. Big mistake. We ordered the 2 for $20, which is a little misleading on menu. You're thinking you get two pizzas plus two salads but you only get one pizza, which in some cases is not even getting as better dealthan just ordering individually. Definitely not worth the money. We spent $29 with tip for a tiny pizza,  two very small salads, and my husband's iced tea. I wouldn't have necessarily minded that if the pizza was really good, but it was not. It was just average. We were left unsatisfied and very disappointed. Also, we went on a Wednesday expecting to find a nice quiet place to eat. Instead, they had half of the restaurant closed off with a DJ playing loud music for what I'm assuming was to be some sort of private party eventually. However, there were only the DJ and a couple people over there during the time we were having dinner. Seems like a waste to have someone preparing so early, playing music so loud that we couldn't even hear each other speak. This place had more of a sports bar feel with Italian food. If you're drinking then you'll probably be ok with the mediocre food. However, if you want a nice dinner, we suggest you go somewhere else. We had thought that this place was going to become one of our new favorites until new management came in and changed it for the worse. The food is not as good, the options are few, and the atmosphere has gone downhill. We definitely won't be going back and we will make sure to warn our friends and family as well.
83	2	a	"What a great place! I wasn't sure if I was going to like a Mexican-Asian fusion restaurant. I was skeptical. I'm happy to report I was pleasantly surprised! My friends told me that it's kind of like a tapas (small plate) menu, so we ordered a bunch of stuff & shared. First out was the \""bacon guacamole\"" which was tasty. Next out was \""tempura unagi roll\"" which was good as well. It reminded me a lot of a Las Vegas roll. We also had the \""crispy pork belly roll\"" which was different. It was pretty good, but I don't normally like pork belly. My friends really liked it though. I also ordered the \""Lobster & Crab Dynamite\"" which was delicious. For a drink I ordered the skinny margarita which was awesome. This is definitely a busy, \""where the cool people hang out\"" type place & I can't wait to try more things off the menu."
84	2	a	Amazing color selection (great quality), super friendly ALL lady nail techs who really do an excellent job. This shop changed management a few months back and the new folks are AMAZING. It's the perfect blend of friendly, neighborhood nail salon, great prices and clean, modern equipment. You will NOT be disappointed!
85	2	a	This is my only review I've wrote on yelp after using this app for years. I'm writing it because I was so satisfied with this cafe. I ordered off of eat24 and my food was at my door FAST! It's nice having delivery options especially when it's good food and fast. I don't know what that other guy was complaining about you guys kick ass
86	1	a	"Don't waste your time & money on the shakes. It took forever, small for $4.38, and they \""hand spun\"" the thickness out of it. It was grainy chocolate milk. \n\nI am beginning to think that we ate at a completely different place than other reviewers. We actually threw  a lot of the food out. Burger was awful. Rubbery chicken sandwich had been cooked on same griddle w/ burgers. Even had burger scrapings on it and the bottom bun was so soggy I couldn't eat it. Beyond disappointing. I usually give places a 2nd chance, but not this time. Sorry."
87	2	a	"The first time I tried Smashburger, I wasn't expecting a \""chain burger\"" to be so good. In fact, I went back a few more times to make sure it wasn't a tasty fluke. My burgers took about 5 minutes each to arrive, but were worth the wait and tasted much, much better than any fast food burgers you can get in 2 minutes. I left the last visit thinking out loud that Smashburger is the \""Starbucks of fast burgers\"" because their customization, options, and consistent execution are where they really shine. \n\nThe burger patties themselves are good - not the best I've ever had, but a tasty, solid option. Their avocado club burger had fresh cooked bacon and what looked like a half an avocado on it. The  bbq, bacon, and cheddar burger was sweet, smoky, and salty all at the same time. The truffle mushroom swiss burger is on par with what I'd expect to eat at a much fancier farm to table place. Their (very skinny) fries are tossed in olive oil, rosemary, and garlic and come in multiple variations.\n\nIf you don't see something you like on the menu, customization is the name of the game. You can order custom toppings, sauces, breads, or even sub out the burger for chicken or a black bean burger. This is the first fast burger place I've felt like I can order my food in any combination available and be fully satisfied with the results."
88	2	a	"To all my CHAIN HATERS out there....DON'T READ MY REVIEW! OK....I'm one of those \""Chain\"" haters so sue me. BUT! I've got to tell you that THIS chain is A-OK! Why? Because their burgers are DARN TOOTIN GREAT....that's why!\n\nYou know, upon thinking about it, you've got to believe that the reason a brand becomes a \""chain\"" is because they have a pretty good product to being with, right? Think of The Cheesecake Factory. Yes, I'm a BIG FAN! Like I am with P.F. Changs, Five Guys Burgers. GREAT food and service (usually). So why not Smashburger? OK Smashburger, you WIN!\n\nHad their \""Big\"" Mushroom Truffle Burger on an Egg Bun. Added bacon and grilled onions. MAN was this ever a SLOPPY burger....just the way I like them! Very juicy and very \""BEEFY\"" meaning, plenty of FAT and not lean. Hey if I wanted lean I'd eat Chicken Breast, right? No Sirloin Burgers here....must be Chuck or something like that. Nevertheless, it really was great!\n\nOh, their fries are parmesean herb shoestrings which were REALLY good! I love shoestrings because they remain crispy, and the flavor that Smashburger imparts on them are really great!\n\nOverall a 4.37 STAR experience! I just wish that they'd offer a Double Burger for us true Meat-a-tarians!"
89	1	a	I ordered Pad Thai with beef A La Cart. First thing I noticed was it was a small portion.  Second thing was there wasn't much beef. Beef was a little tough but for the most part it was tasty. Different from many Thai places.\n\nI also ordered a large Tom Yum soup with chicken. Standard size amount. This too was prepared differently than most places. Chicken was tough and flavor was ehhhh \n\nPlace has seats for inside eating but restaurant is designed for take out.\n\nSmall portion sizes along with the cost makes this an undesirable place for me to return. For $23 ...I expected more
90	1	a	For $20 food I would rather go to Thai BBQ. The servings here are to small for the price.
91	1	a	This restaurant is no longer in business.
92	2	a	Great service. Mike was professional and courteous. Best of all they showed up on time. I'm normally navigating a jammed  packed schedule and punctuallity is premium fot me. The price was good and the service was even better. I have found my guys.
93	2	a	Helicopter tour at dusk over the strip. Excellent ride. Excellent customer service. Must do on the bucket list. Definitely ride with doors off.
94	1	a	I ordered the Korean Steak Quesadillas. Generous in portion, but sad in flavor. I am a huge fan of Korean style cooking, well aside from kimchi. However, this place realy fell short for me. I was really expecting an amazing flavor from the food. Instead, I was met with slightly seasoned steak. I had a small pile of lettuce, tomatoes, kim chi and sweet and spicy sauce in addition to the three quesadillas.\n\nI really have nothing terrible to say, however, I have nothing great to rave about. It just tasted like an average grilled quesadilla.\n\nBring cash, they prefer it. Very few people pay with card so the line goes fast.
95	1	a	6-24-2014 walked in and found an open table..promptly told it was reserved with 8 tables open! Well he did not offer us anything open and did not welcome us! This is the South! We are welcoming not Pissy Alex! He said he was the owner.. Not southern, Not Texan and Not Nice! We went to Wet Willies and they have a patio to hear the concert!!!
96	1	a	The restaurant was empty, but the hostess told us it would be about a 20 minute wait, so we decided to sit at the bar instead. It took at least 15 minutes for anyone to acknowledge that we were there and another 15 minutes for drinks. I flagged the bartender down and asked for dinner menus, which he should've already voluntarily given us. He acted frustrated that I asked and told me I would have to hang on because he was really busy. After another 25 minutes of waiting for a menu, we paid for our drinks and left. We were sitting right in front of the beer taps where they saw us every single time they went to pour a beer. It wasn't like we were off on a distant corner of the bar. I'm a very patient person, but that was all I could handle that night. I will never be visiting this place again.
97	1	a	This place is awful for multiple reasons:\n1. Food - bland, under cooked, unoriginal. I ordered yucca fried which tasted like freezer burn. They were mushy and undercooked. The tacos were lackluster too. Chicken tinga was dry and portobello mushroom was slimy and not seasoned at all. Totally gross. Not worth any money. This place should honestly shut down based on food alone.\n\n2. Service - how long does it take to bring out water? 15 minutes apparently. It's slow, which is incredibly surprising given how empty the place is. The waitress didn't even ask me if I wanted a second drink. I would've said no bc my first was gross.\n\nThis place is worse than a college dining hall. Food is gross, service is slow, I'm never coming back and openly hating on this place via yelp.
98	2	a	What a fun place to have close to home! Definitely more of a place to come for drinks, not to eat. We came on a Friday night & this place was packed! Luckily it's huge so we were seated right away. They had some awesome music playing, albeit loud, but we were here for a good time so it didn't bother us. I noticed they had $3 jaeger shots so we each started with those.  My husband ordered buffalo wings & I ordered the caesar salad foccacia wrap.  A few shots later our food came out. My husband loved his wings, my wrap was just meh.  Not much chicken & the fries that came with it were so soggy & greasy that they were inedible. Probably 2 stars for the food. I also ended the night with one of their $3 Zipparitas which was so unbelievably strong that my husband had to help me finish.  We will definitely be back soon, just not for food.  Their happy hours & reverse happy hours are awesome, something new every day of the week.
99	1	a	Decent happy hour beer prices...and an overall good vibe.  But the food is terrible.  It looks really appetizing but has no flavor whatsoever.  The chicken green chili rolls had white meat chicken and cheese and green chilis wrapped in a spring roll wrapper and deep fried.  What's not to like, right?  Well yeah, there was no taste at all.  It didn't even taste like cardboard, just like nothing.  The salsa also was very bland.  I have to say though that the guac was not bad.  So, go there to drink and to watch the 10,000 TVs they have but not for the food.
100	1	a	"Went to Zipps today to get some beer and food after a great game of golf. Was extremely disappointed. After arriving our beer too almost 30 minutes to get for our entire table. I understand we had a big table of 15 but how long can it take. From there it took 45 minutes to receive our food. Our longest food item was pizza, which took 30 minutes, yet it still took that long to get everything out. Our food was cold, which did not sit well with everyone. Finally, when discussing this with their manager, she did not provide any relief beyond more \""Zipps bucks.\""  Im not sure who you are but this does not help not cunt towards making day. My group was not the nicest but even though I handled the situation there was no resolve. This was the worst service ever and I do not recommend anyone going there again.  I would hope a business like this cared about their customers vs. ruining their outing. Cheers!"
101	2	a	Well, my faith in Claim Jumpers has restored! We had a group function today, serving our local support team. Our appetizers came out before our meal and we were given adequate time to eat then before the arrival of our entrees. We were served fresh baked bread along with our entrees, which as a very pleasant surprise!\nWe pretty all ordered the chicken pot pie which came very recommended by colleagues...and it was well deserved. It was very large and extremely delicious!
102	2	a	"Tr\u00e8s bon restaurant en plein coeur de Centropolis. \n\nC'est parfait pour partager un repas \u00e0 plusieurs. Tel un restaurant libanais, vous aurez droit \u00e0 diff\u00e9rentes pur\u00e9es que vous pourrez d\u00e9guster avec un pita. Nous avions un plateau pour 2 et c'\u00e9tait suffisant pour 2, si ce n'\u00e9tait m\u00eame pas trop. Donc, si vous avez une petite faim, prenez un plateau pour 2 \u00e0 3 personnes.\n\nDu hummus, de la pur\u00e9e de piments et beaucoup d'autres classiques libanais.\n\nEnsuite, nous avons eu droit \u00e0 un \""plateau de la mer\"" et un \""plateau de la terre\"". Chacun des plateaux pourraient nourrir une arm\u00e9e compl\u00e8te. Des brochette de filet mignon, poulet, caille et l\u00e9gumes grill\u00e9es. Pour le plateau de la mer, il y a du saumon, des \u00e9crevisses et de tr\u00e8s bonne p\u00e9toncles il para\u00eet.\n\nBref, en plein coeur du Centropolis et un bon pit stop apr\u00e8s une journ\u00e9e compl\u00e8te \u00e0 faire des activit\u00e9s l\u00e0-bas."
103	1	a	"Growing Pains Have Yet To Improve\n\nWe have gone here several times in the months that is has been open, and overall the experiences are usually the same, with the concneus being an overwhelming \""Meh.\""  The beer selection is great, the food can be good, but the staff has no sense of urgency, which can ruin the great idea of this concept.\n\nOur last meal was a bust from the start, with the standard unattentive server.  Drinks took forever, and while we got $5 flights, there was limited explanation of which beer was which in the \""Build Your Own Flight.\""  At least, as a saving grace, we could figure it out, but that was a bit frustrating.\n\nThe food took much prodding to get from our server.  When it did arrive, only the sandwiches were hot.  The soup was both lukewarm and bland; as if they were attempting to pay homage to grilled cheese with condensed Campbell's soup from childhood.  My fries were also not hot, though we did have both items promptly replaced with a hotter version.\n\nThe final issue that left us sour was that with the second round of flights, they were out of the normal glassware to do them.  The bartender's solution was to use shot glasses, netting us a serving that was half size.  This was called out, and we did get an extra pint, but I am not sure why free glassware from Sam Adams is in such short supply in a beer based gastropub, especially when the flight glasses are free from a Sam Adams rep.\n\nThe entire experience reaffirmed that the only way to do The Yard is drinks only, and only at the bar rail.  You can at least get your beer on time then, other than that, it can sit at service bar for several minutes while the staff is nowhere to be found. \n\nThat's the shame of it all, the place has so much potential.  They just don't care to try."
104	2	a	"Stopped in for a late lunch with a client and got seated in a booth right away! Lunch special was a fabulous BLT with sugared bacon, garden fresh tomatoes, no mayo and some delicious bread and greens! Best BLT both my guest and I have ever had and served with some great sides-sweet potato fries or home made coleslaw. This was not your Grandma's BLT-modern twist with the greens and no mayo! Great service and an all around fun lunch! Love the wine cellar feel of the place with the natural stone, bank of wine storage at one end of the bar behind glass and big, comfortable booths with natural wood tables. An \""10\"" for experience and food!"
105	2	a	The most amazing burgers that I have ever had in Canada but the place doesn't match right. \nThe look of the place and music doesn't match the menu. It's hard to describe but the burgers and fries are still amazing.\n\nI only give this place 4/5 not 5/5 because it is a little pricy for just burgers and the fries are an addition. Hamburger and fries are suppose to come as a package.
106	1	a	Had great expectations for this place. My wife loves tenders and she was not impressed. $24 for lunch and although the cole slaw was fresh it was vinegar based which taste sour. The fries were tasty but we hate shoestring fries, reminds us of Shake & Steak. Service was great though. Wanted to try fried banana pudding but $5! Played loud country music also, which we not fond of. Hubee D's please try harder
107	1	a	Sales people and staff in the actual store are amazing. The phone end of customer support, service and repair and credit are no bueno.
108	1	a	Don't trust them , no customer service . Don't waste your money .
109	1	a	This place turned me off! I was approved for credit! I went in to buy a washer and dryer. The price match guarantee is only good if the same product is in the competitors weekly ad! What? So I should pay $200+ more for your washer because you approved me for credit? It's a scam and a great way to get a bad name.
110	2	a	By far the best Mexican food here in Vegas !!! The taco (pastor/carne meat was well marinated) I will definitely be a regular here !!
111	2	a	My fianc\u00e9 and I dined at Mercadito not long after it's opening so I went in under the assumption that there would be some kinks that would need to be worked out, but that was definitely not the case. The staff was super friendly and our busser was very attentive. \n\nThe food was excellent (definitely try the guac with bacon... Mmmmmm bacon....). Enchiladas were hot and flavorful. Cocktails were great and the chocolate cake lava dessert? Fantastic! I'll be back!
112	2	a	I have come here to eat about 3 times a month. I have definitely spread the word about this place. The food is great, even though their menu is a little small. I have been waiting since the opening for then to get Bloody Marys though. When I go I tend to order a little of everything, but I always order the tacos that have pineapple on them. They are amazing. If you are industry you should go on Tuesday or after 10. They give you 50% off your entire bill (drinks included). The only thing that really bothers me is how loud the music is. OMG is it loud. My favorite server there is a girl named Panini (hopefully I spelled it right).
113	2	a	They deserve the 5 stars for making their margaritas with fresh lime juice. This makes the drink superb. Most places use mix and it ruins the margaritas. We also tried their salsas which were really good. They have fresh made chips, also a must for Mexican. They are open until midnight during the week, which makes this a great place to end the night.
114	1	a	"Meh. I'm a big believer in setting expectations. What happened to under promise and over deliver. Checked in and told 45 minute wait for a party of three. Ok, it's Saturday. Ended up waiting over an hour, the staff seemed unorganized. I checked back with hostess after the forty five, told \""setting you up right now\"", nope. Another young lady asks if we've checked in and says she'll check the status and be right back- goes to hostess station and just stands there smiling.??? 80 minutes. But we heard it was good and were determined to try it.\nFinally seated and wait staff is very helpful. Glad it was Restraunt Week as the regular price if $14+ for some street tacos is a bit much. Disappointing that an order must all be same style as that means you're stuck with one version.  The promotion allowed us to try multiple items without breaking the bank.  Carne and chicken tacos were good, they forgot our mahi mahi tacos until we asked for them when the waiter came to take our dessert order. As a non-flan fan I have to say the flan was super tasty.  Overall I go back to meh, I don't think I'll be giving it another try. Wish the burger place was still here- so hard to get a good hamburger in this town without hitting a GR place on the Strip."
115	1	a	After reading some reviews I decided ro go check this place out. Me an my wife waited about 8 minutes before the server came to the table. The menu was very limited so I ordered beef torta and the wife had the carne tacos. The waiter was kinda spacy, may have been gay, not sure but definitely seemed new at being a server. Anyways, food came and was not impressed with portion size or presentation.  All the food had no flavor and there was no salt, pepper, surgar ect at the table either. Fries was old and everything was very bland. The manager came to table  to see how everything was so I told him everything was band and he was eager to try to resolve but I did not want anything as I dont expect to be back. Was at the red rock casino location..
116	2	a	Gus or Gustavo who is a trainee was great (Thanks for the good time sir). Food was excellent and drink suggestions were right on.
117	1	a	Food was absolutely horrible ! Never had tacos like these before ! The taste was just undelightful. The meat my tacos had was not fully cooked so it still felt gushy. I also had a michelada which I've ordered before and it tasted nothing like it. The place is really nice though. Love the atmosphere just would never recommend to eat here. Oh and make sure you bring MONEY; everything is charged even hot sauces !!!!!
118	2	a	Very nice little ice cream place. They only have soft serve ice cream, but you get to choose your dip and the toppings. I've only been once so have yet to try all the dips but i was very happy with my first experience. The ice cream itself is what you would expect (it's classic soft serve), but the chocolate/caramel dip with bits of crushed Oreos was awesome.\nI will definitely go back the next time I'm craving some sweetness!
119	1	a	"Waited 25 min after being told 5-10. Then tried to seat us in the bar at a high top but I can't sit in them because I have a leg that doesn't bend. The entire time we waited there was an open booth in the bar area that we were told we couldn't sit at. Then a group that came in after us was offered the booth. But they took a night top, so I asked again about the booth. Still no. Even the manager didn't help. Her response was \""I can't just jump in and tell her how to seat people\"" never coming to this applebees again!"
120	2	a	What a surprise this place is!  Great Middle Eastern food and pizza and wings. I to believe it is a hidden Gem. Spread the word great food great prices.
121	2	a	This place is like a popcorn lovers dream! Such good flavors. The owner is very nice and helpful. It's great that you can sample as many flavors as you wish (this makes it hard to pick flavors lol.)  I really love this place I'm glad it's so close to home! My favorite flavor is the cookies and cream. I never would have thought this would be my favorite flavor but it's taste is great and it actually has pieces of cookies! Popcorn is a little expensive but the quality and taste are so good it's worth paying a little more. I hope this place is here for the long haul!
122	1	a	1 word\nGhetto\n\nInstead of mopping up a spill, I witnessed several employees walk through it.  1/2 the staff playing around while watching how to reload the soda machine. A kitchen full of people, why in the hell sis my order take so long? Ain't nobody in the dinner room or the drive thru.
123	2	a	I recently had my hair done by Suzanne, and I couldn't be happier!! Most of my family and I have been going to her for 10+ years. She always does an amazing job for both men and women. I got my hair dyed this time. I sent her a picture of what I wanted ahead of time, and she went out her way to track down the perfect colors for the job. She really cares about her work and making sure it is perfect. Again, I couldn't be happier about my hair. So glad she's at a salon right around the corner from my house!
124	2	a	I went to J Anthony salon and spa and had a wonderful experience with Abby I have had dermaplaning done before but she is the best and when you meet her you will fall in love with her. She is also an expert in Oxygenix makeup. I would never go to anyone else but Abby and the makeup is fabulous. It was a wonderful experience and she has taught me a lot there's no other place to go but J Anthony salon for derma planing and ask for Abby
125	1	a	"I'd say 2.5 stars. Decent but odd dining room. Food is better than the looks of the place would lead you to believe. \nIf you're just interested in good food this place will fit the bill. If you're looking for more of an \""experience\"" then another place may be better suited for what you are looking for."
126	2	a	"So this review is from an OLD visit. I'd been meaning to write this and am just now getting around to it. Better late than never right?\n\nSo, I've been a diehard Germany soccer fan for a few years now. I was really excited this World Cup and had already watched 2 games at the Hofbrauhaus which cost me more than I'd like to talk about. Let's just say I have no qualms with drinking at 8am. SO on a whim I decided to check out if there were any other German joints that were: 1. Closer to me and 2. More affordable. Lo and behold this place popped up on my search a WEEK after they opened! Talk about fate!\n\nI call them asking if they'll be showing the game that morning, to which I was told, \""If you're here for the game, our door will be open!\"" So next morning I show up, decked out in my jersey and facepaint, and they let me in before operating hours to watch the game (Germany vs. France, we won of course) and serve me and my boyfriend beer. Talk about service! And getting to smell all the wonderful smells from the kitchen as they were preparing for the day made the day even better!\n\nNot to mention the food is SO GOOD. German cuisine, in my opinion at least, is the ULTIMATE COMFORT FOOD. The potato salad (Kartoffelsalat) is a different variation of what I'm used to making or getting, but YUM! I wanted spaetzle, but the machine was broken that day, thankfully I was not disappointed with the salad at all. Topping off the whole experience is the expertly made from scratch Apfelstrudel. DO NOT HESITATE TO ORDER THIS! It is just like my Tante used to make, SEHR LECKER!\n\nI'll definitely be back here not only to enjoy the wonderfully authentic food, but to support the lovely people who accommodated a wild soccer fan on the day of the World Cup Quarterfinals. I appreciated the hospitality more than you know! :]"
127	1	a	The owner Damiana crimi is a very rude person. She failed to keep an appointment with me and then had the nerve to keep texting me nasty messages. Her behavior is very unprofessional as she will harass you with threats to sue you for no reason. When I asked her to stop contacting me, she continued to harass me with emails and phone calls stating that she can do what she wants. Ive never had someone be so vengeful for no reason! It was her fault that she did not show up for our appointment, not mine. Do not deal with her or you willl end up getting harrassed! She even started slandering my company just to try to get her way. Very unprofessional, unpleasant and in my opinion she is crazy! BEWARE!!
128	1	a	I went here with a Groupon deal, expecting fruity delicious smoothies. When I arrived there were little kids milling around behind the counter while no employees were in sight. When finally greeted by an employee we ordered a raspberry blackberry chia seed and a strawberry banana smoothie. The fruit is not fresh, it's all frozen. Both smoothies were gross and tasted overwhelmingly of wheat germ and dirt not fruit. I don't know what everyone else got but our smoothies were not good. Definate miss
129	1	a	This is the worst bar I've ever been to. I was looking forward to checking it out, but was extremely disappointed. It took ten minutes for us to be acknowledged, and when we finally were, I didn't even receive my drink at all. We were planning on ordering food, but couldn't get anyone to take our order. So after waiting for our bill for another twenty minutes, we left and will not be returning.
130	2	a	The infused whiskey is my favorite beverage at this restaurant! Looking forward to more choices of this style!! The food is bar food with some twists however the exemplary service is what makes this spot stand out! Look out Lodge there's a new place to choose.
131	1	a	We love the food, our second time here. Unfortunately, we sat at the bar and the people just not friendly. We sat at the bar and I think the guys name is Chris, very antisocial, etc. But at least the food is great
132	2	a	An outstanding new addition to the Southern Highlands Bar scene. Staff is friendly and courteous and the food is great. \n\nThe place is also configured well and you don't feel crammed or worried about having a place to sit.\n\nPool tables are nice and parking was easy.\n\nWe found our new place to hang out.
133	2	a	I went Monday and I love going after work. I got my eyebrows waxed and a fresh gel overlay. I had to soak off the acrylic off my nails. The technician actually took the time to do and didn't damage or hurt my nail beds like other salons do.  My nails came out perfect and I'm happy. I'll be returning again.
134	1	a	Called in for delivery and the guy taking the order was so obnoxious. He couldn't write down a simple phone number. Yea and 27 dollars for a large pizza with garlic?? No. Just so much no. This isn't Los Angeles, it's downtown phoenix so don't kid yourself. Way too expensive for a pizza. It's good but not that good. Also, $3 per topping?! Tessio's charges 50 cents per topping. Are these limited edition or endangered toppings? The audacity.
135	1	a	Make sure to ask about the level your sandwich will be toasted. My sandwich was cold. I did not go back to the location because it was far from my departing gate. The whole purpose of Quiznos is for toasted subs/sandwiches. Now I regret walking all the way over there from concourse E. I've had toasted sandwiches from Quiznos before and for the price this location charges, one would think they would be more diligent about toasting the toasted sandwich as it is advertised. Not a good experience.
136	2	a	Shoot Las Vegas is an amazing experience.  Everything there is professional, well secured (each shooting station is manned by a trained Range Safety Officer) and very educational.  I can see where this would be great for a bachelor party or a team building exercise.  In the description it states that Eric has 25 years in the event planning industry and it shows.  The operation is safe and the details add to a very enjoyable afternoon.  At each station (Western, Big Guns, Military, Law Enforcement, Gangster and Sniper) you get your photo taken shooting the guns there and you get to keep the photos as a great souvenir.  Each type of gun is also shown as to which movies it was used in.  This is an event that I will never forget and I am glad that I did it.  I highly recommend this to anybody who has an interest in guns or the movies that they are used in.
137	2	a	Great Italian food....They messed up my pizza order but went above and beyond brought out a different pizza for appetizer and a beer on the house! Great restaurant and great service but the best thing is the food fresh ingredients and good Italian great atmosphere.
138	1	a	"I held off on reviewing until I had a chance to try Cento a third time.\n\nFirst, the good:\n\n- The setting is awesome. Might be the best designed restaurant setting in Madison.\n- The drinks are quite good. It's definitely worth checking out the cocktail menu\n- Staff is friendly but not exceptional yet\n\nThe not so good; I've tried a few things off the menu over 3 visits (Bacon dates, gnocchi, beef tartare, burrata, beets, porchetta pizza, bucatini carbonara, pork chop, cauliflower) so I think the following thoughts are pretty accurate. In general, the food doesn't measure up to the ambiance or price.\n\n- Gnocchi was overworked/gummy. They were described as \""pillows\"" and they definitely didn't come out that way. I mentioned this in passing to our waitress when she asked how everything was and I got the impression that she didn't really put much credence in my feedback.  \n- Food was underseasoned across the board. Pizza crust had very little flavor and the bucatini carbonara lacked salt - not sure how that's even possible given the fact that the ingredients include parmigiano and pork cheek (guanciale).\n- Pork chop was overcooked (we wanted to try the beef or lamb but both were sold out when we went )\n\nI really hope the food continues to improve and I'm not ready to give up on Cento yet. I still love the setting and will update this review if my next meal justifies it."
139	1	a	Platos closet in Scottsdale needs to hire more mature, educated people. These girls that go through the clothes are idiotic. They barely look through anything and decline most of it. All of the things I brought in (7 grocery bags full, organized by item) were recent, trendy, lightly worn items. I saw many things in the store that were similar and even more that were in worse quality/out of style. When you go to sell they seem angry that they have to work and are just messing around like kids while people shop.. Very unimpressed. Before this store moved to this location it was much better!
140	2	a	So I know my past review was a little rough, but my second and definitely short visit was able to calm my senses. This company really strives to make sure that their customer satisfaction is truly guaranteed. The owner, Brooke, is super nice and addressed my concerns in such a kind manner. I happened to have time to stop by today for some pineapple whip and she wasn't there but I thought I would give it a try anyway. The guy ended up being another owner, her husband, and he was very friendly and knew about my situation because she spoke with him about it! They definitely didn't treat me differently because of my bad review, but they just understood where I was coming from. It seemed to have been an error with Groupon's company so I'm currently trying to get that fixed at the moment! For now, he offered me some whip and I was such a happy happy camper. Once again, texture was perfect and flavor was on point! Their menu was different than the first time I came and it was written on a chalk board! Really cute! He said they're adding more things to the menu and spicy-ing the place up a bit so I'm looking forward to the new changes. They definitely have an awesome lil shop and what I've had so far is great. I can't wait to keep coming back and trying new things. Just wish they were closer to home! Truly my new go-to dessert stop. If you're in the area, you gotta try it.
141	1	a	We ate here tonight and it was not good! We ordered the mahi tacos and mahi entree. The fish had a fishy taste and was very dry.\nThe sides didn't have any flavor. To top it off, the service was very slow and some things didn't come at all. It took 15 minutes to get the check. I hope things improve but I can't recommend this place.
142	2	a	Good oysters, cold drinks and great service. Makes for a wonderful date night or a day out with friends
143	1	a	"I was so excited to see a Pink Box Donuts coming to this location, as it is close to where I work. I'd seen them on some food show, and saw all the rave reviews. \n\nMy test of a donut shop is how good their plain raised donut is. After all, if you don't have a good base, none of your donuts will be good. So, I got a plain raised and some sort of turtle cheesecake donut. \n\nI took the plain one out, turned it over and took a sniff. No, I don't have a donut fetish. What I want to smell is that nice, yeasty fresh donut smell. Nope. All I smelled was sugar.  Let me backup to say that when I walked into the shop, I was surprised that it didn't have that \""OMG fresh baked donut\"" smell. Now I know why. \n\nSo, tasting the plain donut was an adventure only my dentist would love. It tasted like nothing but sugar. The glaze had to be the sweetest I've ever tasted. Usually glaze is powdered sugar and some sort of liquid - milk, melted butter, lemon juice, whatever. What did they do, mix their sugar with corn syrup?  So, giving up on the plain after a couple bites, I went to the turtle cheesecake one. I will say the cheesecake filling was nice, but again the donut itself had no flavor. The topping was pretty good but again very sweet. \n\nI'm disappointed and expected more after everything I've seen and read. You can't cover a mediocre donut with a bunch of toppings and sugar and call it good."
144	1	a	Terrible service. Short tempers with two different guys working there. The vegan options are pretty limited and expensive. They charge a lot extra per topping. And a lot extra if you want the vegan cheese. Also no tap water only bottled. Pizza wasn't bad.
145	2	a	Have to go get nailed and lashed!!!  \nThis is a new salon on sunset and fort apache...great location, amazing staff...everyone is so friendly and very welcoming!!!! Book your appt today!!!
146	2	a	Finally got the chance to try out this new little coffee spot, had been hearing good things about it since it opened. I tried the pumpkin, honey cappuccino which was delicious. It is inside the Evening Muse which is already a pretty awesome spot and while we were there they had folks set up selling donuts and a few other goodies. Def. worth stopping by if you are in the area.
147	1	a	If I could rate it lower than one star I would.  Poor service, been waiting an hour for burgers.  When we questioned the waitress regarding the wait for food she replied, the kitchen isn't equipped to handle this many people.  It would be a nice location to open a freaking restaurant.
148	2	a	Uber Fresh and Delish!\n\nI always sit at the bar and talk to the owner. If the fish isnt fresh, they dont have it. Uni is from Santa Barbara. They get toro in usually too. They are moving locations in the same plaza.\n\nM-Th they have happy hour all day
149	2	a	Came looking for pho, found so much more. Great appetizers from the tradition fresh spring rolls with shrimp & port, to beef mango salad that was awesome to a new fish I hadn't had before.. Shrimp pancake with a touch of scallion & coconut (for $4.95 it's a must!).  Fresh ingredients, a no grill atmosphere and very friendly staff; we will be back.  Oh yeah, and table brewed Vietnamese coffee with sweet condensed milk. Yum!
150	2	a	I cannot tell you what makes a good pho good, but I can definitely tell a bad pho from the first sip of the soup. The soup at Pho Lan is authentic with no taste of msg. It is fresh and light. For the price, it is not a huge portion, but it is pretty tasty. I will come back if I ever crave for pho again when I am in Vegas.
151	2	a	I had the nachos with carne asada awesome.\nBean and cheese burritos were good.\nBeef taco was a tad greasy but good flavor.
152	1	a	Never, I mean never come here! To begin with this place rapes you and they got my gf order wrong and gave it to another costumer, what blows my mind was there was 4 workers and they still couldn't make it right! And the manager was looking at his workers and arguing with them and he never looked at us and apologized, we ate our food cause we starving!!!!
153	1	a	I can't even tell you how happy I was to see that Los Taquitos was finally opened in terminal 4 at Sky Harbor, so happy! I am a fan of their south Phoenix location. \n\nSo I checked out the menu board, didn't see anything that would catch my eye, but I was committed to giving them a try. I ordered a carne asada burrito and asked for extra salsa, even paid for it, order came out to 11 bucks, didn't even get a drink.\n\nMy order came out, let's start with the burrito, the tortilla was cold the meat had good flavor, but it was just carne & beans, that's it , no pico de gallo no guac, it was wrapped in a aluminum colored wrapping and came in a container with beans and rice, but the wrapped burrito was placed directly into the beans, so now that's a mess. \n \nThe beans were cool and so was the rice, it was like everything was made in a freezer house, oh and the extra salsa I had paid for, I had to ask for and the server gave a little tude because I question its whereabouts.\n\nI was thrilled to see Los Taquitos was coming into the airport, but now that I have been, I can't say I will be back.
154	2	a	Somebody pinch me, an auto repair place that is a joy to deal with?  Thanks to Jon, Stephanie & Jeremy, I can only drive Hondas, Toyotas or Acura because that is all they work on and I won't go anywhere else.
155	1	a	"This place... meh, there are better places in town. Here's the deal: I walked in and told the guy behind the desk what I wanted done: preventive maintenance, tire rotation and oil change. He seemed confused that I'd found the place myself. \""Normally, we get referrals from the tire place next door,\"" he said. Okayyy.... uh, that's cool, I guess? Then he asked how I'd found them. \""Internet searches, Yelp,\"" I said. He seemed confused as to what Yelp is. Baffling.\n\nThey did get my car done in the time they had promised and they essentially gave me a free diagnostic, which was nice. Oil change and tire rotation came out to $55, basically the standard retail price. \n\nHere's where it gets stupid: they wanted to charge me $90/hour for labor and triple mark-up on the parts in order to replace the serpentine belt and water pump. I know that mechanics mark up parts, but triple is ridiculous. I called around and ended up getting a quote from Gino's in Plaza Midwood for 30% less. Still a slight mark-up, but pretty much right down the middle, with reasonable labor costs. So, I'm going to Gino's instead.\n\nPeace out, Select Import. For your next customer, learn about this thing called Yelp and competitive pricing on parts and service."
156	1	a	Worst company ever! DO NOT USE!  just like all the other reviewers said..i waited a month for them to fit me in the schedule..my appt was today and surprise surprise..NO SHOW.  I called, facebook messaged them, emailed them at least a dozen times.  How is this company not out of business with all the negative feedback.  Living social needs to remove this deal as well..they shouldn't be supporting a business like this! CLOSE THIS PLACE DOWN ASAP SOMEONE!
157	2	a	If you are considering to try their: \nchicken skin, lechong kawali, tosilog, bbq pork, bangusilog and bicol express, yes try them -- they're all *good.\n\nThe bangus was a bit smaller than i expected, the lechong kawali and chicken skin could be a little crispier.\n\nIf you like bicol express i think you're gonna love their bicol express! Out of all that i have tried their bicol express was impressive!\n\nAlmost all of the groups who were there at the same time we were there ordered bulalo so i'm assuming their bulalo is good. We're gonna try that next time we crave for Filipino food.\n\nHaving said all these if their prices were a little higher and their servings a little smaller i probably would think twice about giving them 4 stars.
158	1	a	Not worth it!
159	1	a	My relatives wanted filipino food so here we were. The dining area is alright but the food and service wasn't really good. Our dishes came out at all different times and the portions were kinda small for the price, especially the appetizers. I've had way tastier, I don't know what the options are around here but I'm sure there are better. Some things we got:\n\nLumpia shanghai - small portion and they looked like the frozen kind.\n\nCrispy chicken skin - no flavor and just tasted like fat. Also other pictures had double the portion size than what we got.\n\nAdobo fried rice - I love adobo fried rice and was so disappointed, there was so much oil left on the plate and it didn't really have flavor!\n\nLechon kawali - not that crispy and again didn't have flavor, just tasted oily and fatty.\n\nSinigang - the best thing we ordered, it was really good but everything else was such a let down! Meh.
160	1	a	Man is a jerk...answers the phone Hello...and like he's drunk! Wow...called to list my Home for sale, but I think NOT! Beyond unprofessional...outright WEIRD!
161	1	a	"It's got a ways to go. I debated a season pass the good part is they let you try the park out and if you have your receipt you can pay the difference for a season pass. I had $100 worth of cowabunga cash i wanted to use for admission, for some reason they kept ringing up invalid so the cashier had to get her boss who had to get his boss in which we waited a good 15 minutes for someone to fix the situation. I will have to come back to give a proper review but as of today a part of the park isn't open and 2 slides are not up. The green slide is down because its \""too fast\"". Employees were friendly and a few asked \""did we enjoy the park?\"" Which means they really care, however one cashier had no idea how to work the cash register and I ordered nachos which came with the tiniest cup of cheese and if I wanted more it was .75 cents it wasn't even enough for half the chips. Also, there were three icee machines and only one was working (watermelon/pi\u00f1a colada) and none of the soda machines were operational. I think next year I will buy a pass but not this year."
162	1	a	If I could give this place 0 stars I would...by far the WORST WATER PARK EVER..& I grew up going to water parks =\\ FIRST..let me start by saying WHO SERVES ALCOHOL AT A WATER PARK!?...stupid! SECOND I have been to MANY MANY water parks and NOT ONCE have I ever seen WEIGHT LIMITS & the lifeguards are RRUUDDDEEEE about it...my husband is a football player so he's a big man & he's 6 pounds over the limit & can't go on ANY SLIDESI...then they have a few rides where it's MAX WEIGHT 180...this is a kids place what kid weighs that much? THIRD half the rides are closed and the water park is half ass built IT SHOULDNT EVEN BE OPEN let alone they SHOULD NOT  charge FULL PRICE!!! ... Anyway let's just say the BEST PART of the whopping one hour we were there was GETTING OUR REFUND & going to wet n wild! FIGURE IT OUT COWABUNGA BAY!
163	2	a	Food was good as always. It was pretty busy all the available tables were dirty. Let manager know he cleaned a table for us right away. Then our food took longer than it should have to get out. I am giving 4 stars because even though there was issues the manager recognized it without us complaining and gave us free entree certificates and was very apologetic.
164	1	a	I was extremely disappointed. I've had better burgers at Wendy's and it was over $20 for 2 regular burgers, fries, and drinks. Also it was beautiful outside and we wanted to sit on the patio but 3 of the tables were dirty and the others were taken. These tables and others near us inside weren't cleaned the entire time we ate. I will not be back.
165	1	a	So I was contacted by  Bobi L. From customer service the day after my first review of Smashburger. I was impressed, as I did not expect a response. I told Bobi that I thought it showed  customer service  actually  cared what customers  thought.  Bobi offered to send smashbucks so that we could try them again. I told Bobi that I did not write the review hoping for a free meal, but that  I would  send my address as requested  and try again. Needless to say, that was about a month ago and I have not heard a word since (and no smashbucks). Maybe it takes a while to process? was nice to be initially  contacted (but not since), I still can not see us going back.
166	2	a	Okay so this was an awesome find.\n\n*NOTE: It's kind of hard to find..it's in the Venetian Casino Food Court on the first floor*\n\nWe had the lox bagel, banana and chocolate crepe (amazing), and bacon, egg and cheese crossiant. So good! And cafe au lait and chai tea were great. Everything totaled out to about $48..which is cheap compared to everywhere else I ate in Vegas (including the $25 hamburgers).\n\nWhen I'm in Vegas, I'll be back!
167	1	a	I will NEVER NEVER NEVER NEVER NEVER NEVER NEVER Fly this airline again. Customer service is TERRIBLE and there's no such thing as a cheap flight here!
168	2	a	I am in love with this place! It is like a breath of fresh air! \nI only wish we had something like this on my side of town!
169	2	a	I recently discovered this place and I really like it. I ordered the turkey sandwich which comes with cheese,avocado ...etc on walnut cranberry bread. Needless to say I've been back three times since and ordered the same thing. The only thing they they may want to work on is getting the food out faster. I personally don't mind the wait time but a few other people I recommended it to told me they had to wait quite a while for their to-go orders. I say, worth the wait! Yummy! I hope they eventually expand the menu and have more salad options like chinese chicken salad...etc. It makes sense to add more low carb options to the menu since they're located in the same plaza as Gold's gym. \n\nAnyway.....yum, yum, yum! Go and try it for yourself!
170	2	a	It is a solid four in its category of fast, fresh, and healthy fair (not unlike the evolved Panera). A great choice after a workout or for those who find themselves out for lunch often. Plenty of options. Seared ahi tuna salad was good, dressing ok, a bit watery, but you put it on yourself so not a big deal. Complimentary ingredients in the cauliflower and kale curry salad, although, the vinaigrette is heavy handed (maybe its the pickling of the onions or trying to balance between the curry component and the dressing). I'd like to come in again and try an entree.
171	2	a	Great food! Friendly staff!
172	2	a	I've had a lot of Turkish food that was really middle eastern food so I wasnt sure and my expectations were that it would be middle eastern. I ordered sarma, which most people know as dolma, they were delicious! Very authentic AND Turkish for sure. All the food to follow was very good. \n\nAs a visitor I would have to say that The area is not a great location but dont let that stop you, it is worth the drive from the strip! The staff who served us were friendly and the food was very good!
173	2	a	Food:\n\nHigh quality, colorful ingredients! \nVery tasty! \nTrue to the Turkish /Middle Eastern culture!\nGreat attention to detail w the preparation of the foods...\nSalad was so beautiful and yummy, the kabobs... I could eat them everyday w their Medi Salad \nThe Ezme was very yummy... tomatoes & pepper paste... looks like a reddish hummus... no chickpeas here \nThe Sultan Delight was a very light portion of Lamb layered over baba ghanoush... \nOh, lovely Sarma, how yummy you are!!! Have them if you love grape leaves (Vegetarian)\nTurkish coffee & warm baklava... Yum!\n\nService:\nVery pleasant staff! Alexandrina was very sweet and attentive. .. she made sure we were taken care of and that we were enjoying our food... even offered suggestions & accompaniments...\n\nAmbience:\nLocal strip mall location... the old Opa!\nNot bad at all... the interior is simply decorated w their lovely Turkish lamps \nSmall dance floor area for future live entertainment\nNo liquor license as of this date...\n\nOverall, our dining experience was a very satisfying one... We will definitely return!\n\nThank you to the Chef for such a wonderful Epicurean experience! \n\nThank you, Alex! We will see you soon!\n\nYour constant companion, \n\n~deirdra
174	1	a	I really wanted to like this place but was very disappointed. I took my family (5 total) on a Sunday midday. We were seated upstairs (they were not that busy) and aside from the fact that our drinks were usually full that's where the good service ended. Food was not well staged, appetizers came out the same time as some entrees and then the remaining items trickled in. Asked for extra BBQ sauce for the dry sliders; we were told it was .50 and then it never came. The server came back to other parties several times before getting back to us. Everything was slow. We won't be back.
175	1	a	The worse experience in a restaurant!  My wife ask for a plate that it was overcooked and salty. Told the owner and the plate was replaced with something different. And when the bill came was charge for the 2 plates!!. Never in my life heard of this before!  Poor customer service! !! Oh by the way food wasn't that great either! !
176	2	a	The first taste of the salad is a shock because it is very tart. But it grows on you. The server was very gracious. She made us feel very welcome. The meals were outstanding. The names of what we ate were complicated so I can't name them. We had the eggplant appetizer and a kabob combo and a stew.  They were all very good. The deserts were spectacular. The best baklava I ever had. We will repeat for sure. The price was also more reasonable than most
177	1	a	What a disappointment.  Based on s friend's recommendation we went for a Sunday night dinner.  What a mistake. The place was empty except for one table of two.  We ordered an appetizer from the menu and were told it was not available.  Ordered a salad and the waitress kept asking us if we wanted the garden salad.  No. If we had wanted that one we would order it.  We both chose the Soltani and were told they were out of that too!   Wow!  We then asked for the ground beef kabob medium well.  The waitress came back and said they couldn't prepare it medium rare.   We repeated medium well.  We finally received the meal and it was ok.  We might try it again on a busier night when they have plenty of supplies.
178	1	a	Terrible food the server honestly admitted that the tadig was in his eyes not edible but he still served it to me. I told him this was the worst microwaved tadig from lunch service he agreed apologized and still charged me. What a joke never again will I come to this establishment. How do you serve soggy tadig ??? We were the only table in the restaurant on a Friday night, the atmosphere is like dining in a retirement cafeteria. I feel bad leaving this review but there is not 1 good Persian restaurant in this valley, back to WESTWOOD CA for some awesome Persian food.
179	2	a	These mods and rda's are just some of the stuff we bought.  The V3 Flip,  Stingray mod, Itaste svd vv/vw as well as the asModUs competition style rda, puma Vail quad coil rda,  the magma rda, and the UD ego W. I will continue to visit and buy from Dave and eventually get an authentic mod as they spoiled me by letting me hit their personal authentics. Dave is a good friend. Everyone needs to come visit.
180	1	a	Maybe we went on an off night.\nThe food, although delicious, was cold. Our service was too slow to the point I thought we were forgotten about.\nI would rather go somewhere else, knowing my hard earned money will be going to a delicious and cared for meal.\nIt was worth a try, but we probably won't be back.
181	1	a	I don't know if we went on an off night (I have read other reviews from the night we went that complained about the service as well).  But, to say I was underwhelmed with Bazaar Meat is an understatement.  When we walked in, I was blown away.  It's a dark and very chic looking place.  There is a small casino to your left as you walk in.  I can't believe other restaurants haven't thought of this, it's such a fantastic idea.  I've seen them in clubs, but not restaurants.  Waiting for your table, how about dropping a hundred at roulette?  \n\nThe hostesses were very friendly and we were seated right away.  We had drink orders taken very quickly.  So far, so good.  This place is really an assault on the senses.  There are smells from the grilling, the music is loud, there are alligator heads on the wall, and employees everywhere.  The kitchen is very busy, and you can see most of it from the seating area.  Our server started off friendly, and stayed friendly, but he also stayed away from our table.  This is one of the reasons I am giving 2 stars.  As the meal wore on, he was nowhere to be seen.  It took nearly a half hour to get our check.  Also, a table 2 tables from us remained unbussed for over 20 minutes.  I know you are crowded, it's a new hot restaurant on the Strip, but these are issues that shouldn't happened at a place of this caliber charging what they charge.  Most telling, two in my party ordered cocktails when we sat down.  The glasses remained on the table after they were completed, empty, for the entire 2.5 hour meal.  This would have been an easy fix, yet there they remained.  It became kind of a joke with us to see how long they would last.  Spoiler alert:  they were on the table when we left.  For all I know, they still are.\n\nAs other yelpers note, the menu is not your typical steakhouse.  It was described to us as a steakhouse meets a tapas place.  I would agree, this is a spot on description.  We started with the Iberico ham, the best ham in the world.  For $70 you don't even get 2 ounces (see my picture), but it's the best HAM IN THE WORLD.  I never regret buying this stuff, and it was no different at Bazaar Meat.  It is served with crustinis with tomato spread on them, sort of a Spanish bruschetta.  The whole thing is fantastic, highly recommended, but it ain't cheap folks.  We next went with the chicken croquettes.  You get 5-6 per order for $12, and they were fantastic.  Fried perfectly and lots of b\u00e9chamel flavor.  Loved these things, I could have easily eaten another order.  \n\nA couple at our table ordered the famous foie gras cotton candy.  I didn't try it, they ate it so quickly.  I regretted getting one, but we had other things on our mind....\n\nLike the steaks.  Unfortunately, they were out of the Lindsay Ranch ribeye, which of course I'd had my eye on since making the reservation.  As a result, we went with the Mishiwa Reserve, which is $65 a pound.  Supposedly, our steak weighed 2.5 pounds.  Now, I don't carry a scale with me to dinner, but there is no way this thing weighed 40 ounces.  But, we were hungry, and we ate it rather than complaining.  We did point it out to our server, but he said he had no way of knowing since we started eating.  He's absolutely right, but we still weren't happy with the size of this steak.  I don't know, maybe the bone weighs in at 22 ounces or something.  Also, this is the worst dry aged steak I've eaten.  It didn't have the depth of flavor you expect with dry aging.  Additionally, it wasn't adequately seasoned.  This was a fairly big error on such an expensive steak at a restaurant like this.  We ate the steak because we were hungry (and paid an arm and a leg for it), but we weren't happy.\n\nWe also tried the quarter of a suckling pig.  Now we're talking!  This thing was as advertised: juicy, flavorful, with that great crispy skin.  We got as much meat off of the thing as we could, but all of us could have used more.  \n\nFor sides, we went with the Delmonico potatoes, asparagus, and carrots.  All were good, the potatoes were almost too decadent (if such a state exists).  The asparagus is small, but it was cooked well.  I could have used more flavor from the romesco sauce.  The carrots with pepper and Greek yogurt was probably the table favorite.  I'd absolutely get this dish again.\n\nWe were given a small plate of desserts gratis at the end of our meal.  They, like the rest of the meal, were hit and miss.\n\nOverall, I'd say this is an ambitious and unique addition to the fine dining scene in Las Vegas.  I don't know if we went on a bad night (as noted above, I've seen at least one other review that dined the night we did, November 15, 2014, that complained about the service).  I also know restaurants grow and even the best places have issues.  But, for what we paid, a lot of the things are close to inexcusable.  I'd return, but not for a long time, and I will definitely bring a scale....
182	1	a	Slightly below average Chinese food for way above average price.  \n\nThe flavors of the various noodles we tried are okay, but they could really do a better job on both presentation and how they cook their core product - the noodles.  The noodles were definitely overcooked, which is a bit of a waste considering that these are hand pulled. \n\nWorst complaint is that you are paying an arm and a leg for Chinese food ($20+ on average), and the portions are absolutely tiny.  Any average guy will need 2 orders.  No really.  \n\nThey are still figuring their shit out here as of their grand opening, which is when I came.  Give them a few weeks; maybe it will get better.  \n\nOr maybe they won't.
183	1	a	I stayed at the SLS during opening weekend and everything was fantastic but this place is a FAIL! Although the service is excellent and they are open late (which is perfect for those late night noodle cravings) the food is just not good, in fact its horrible.  Go to the Griddle next door instead, you won't be disappointed.
184	2	a	Really friendly servers and hostesses, love the decor and layout, food is good. Loved the siu mai sampler, the hot noodles are great, and LOVED the taiwanese shaved ice.
185	2	a	I visited this restaurant with a group of friends. As the other reviewers wrote, it is definitely kid friendly, but also easily accommodates adults looking to grab some drinks and nomz. The food is AWESOME. The menu is simple, which I like, because I don't need to spend an hour looking. Tacos or tortas. Those are your options. I had the carnitas (pork belly) and it was amazing. My partner had the fish taco (fried) and they were to die for. These aren't massive tacos, but they are reasonably priced and the presentation is quite stunning, and it comes with 4 on a wooden serving tray. The tortillas are clearly home-made and are awesome. They came with 3 types of sauces - a habanero sauce (epic), a red-tomato sauce (very mild) and a green sauce with avocado. the drinks were also amazing!!! i'm definitely coming back to this place frequently.
186	2	a	The Mexican fusion dishes are exceptionally delicious. The pricing is moderate, we had a large party for dinner and we tried various dishes. The Plato Mixto was a great choice for some of us. Ahi ceviche dish was served in a martini glass and garnished with chips. Brand new restaurant and bar, Bar is open til 3am.
187	2	a	Finding somewhere a) with free seats b) indoors and c) reasonably priced, for food on a Saturday night during the Fringe is no mean feat. And the longer you ramble around George Square, the hungrier you get. Thank goodness, then, that we found Ushers of Edinburgh. \n\nHaving popped up (unbeknown to me) over summer, right next to the Pear Tree and the Blind Poet, this wee bar-come-restaurant is pretty cool. The menu is quite eclectic, ranging from smaller 'bar food snacks' to more substantial meals.\n\n I settled for a salted beef and cream cheese bagel whilst my companion ordered the smoked salmon with soda bread. The burgers that were going past our table did look mighty fine, so I could easily be tempted back to try more.\n\nThe portion sizes were perfect for our dampened appetites (shouldn't have opted for the pre-show sandwiches).  My bagel was really tasty, if a little heavy on the cream cheese for my liking. I'm not a massive fan of smoked salmon so can't personally testify for that, but apparently it was pretty good too.\n\nThe atmosphere was buzzing too, with a stand-up performance going on through the back. Later, there was live music, but the place noticeably quietened down at around half 10. \n\nAlso, the waiting staff were really friendly, which is always nice. Was certainly a better choice than waiting around in the soggy cold for a half-decent bit of pizza in Assembly George Square Gardens.
188	2	a	The pizza here is amazing and the owner Mike is very hospitable!! Oh and you must try the delicious desserts!!!
189	2	a	"Third times a charm? This makes three times I have seen a pizza spot in this location. I stopped in and ordered a \""Monday's Special\"" which is a large cheese pizza for $9.99 and additional toppings are extra. Inside was very busy so I guess others are wanting to this place out too. While I was waiting for my pizza, I noticed they have pizza by the slice for sale. I asked if they could add a slice of Sicilian (cheese) to my order priced at $3.25 and make it to-go. My husband isn't a fan of a lot of sauce on a pizza, but I'm the opposite. I asked for a side of sauce (cost .85 cents) to go along with my pizza for dipping and it and I ended up really liking the flavor. The pizza had a thin crust and the right amount of cheese for it. The pizza wasn't very greasy at all and hubby and I both enjoyed it. The Sicilian slice tasted great and had the crisp crust it should, but I was a but disappointed when I got home and opened the paper bag it was in and it was just on a paper plate inside the bag. They did just open, so it's possible they ran out of to-go boxes, but I hope it's not this way all the time. The Sicilian slice was actually my favorite part. The employees were nice and with the different specials they have going on and the food being decent, I can see coming back.\n\nMost pizza joints have a \""slice special\"" and it has a certain time it runs and sometimes only on certain days. Well, here you can get 2 slices and a drink for $5.50 7 days a week anytime. I thought it was a plus that I could get a slice special for dinner instead of just a restricted lunch time special. Aside from pizza they also have wings, fingers, salads, strombolis, pasta, sandwiches and desserts. They also cater."
190	1	a	"This was my first time at this location. I did not know Upper Crust Pizza went away.\n\nI wanted the chicken fingers, but they did not come with french fries. Fries separately are an extra $3.00. Not that I am a cheapskate, but not trying to pay $15.00 or more on lunch.\n\nSo, I ordered the student special - 2 cheese pizza slices and a drink for $4.50 as the sign says. I paid $5.95. I didn't argue, but I feel that was a dollar too much?\n\nAnyway, I am a native Long Islander. I can make pizza. I was not very impressed with the cheese pizza. It was okay...nothing that will win award, but it was not inedible. I have had better pizza at the Red Rock Station buffet. \n\nWill I go back? If someone else is buying & this is their choice, I will eat there. It would not be a place I myself would say \""Hey family - let's go to Rocco's\"".\n\nIMO, the best 5 pizza places still in existence in Vegas are: Red Rock Pizza, Napoli's Pizza, Mark Rich's, Broadway Pizza, & Metro Pizza."
191	2	a	The fish, I had the paddock was amazing...melted in my mouth.  The coleslaw was dry (I think it was pre measured too early in the day) the fries while generous were not as fresh as they should have been. Love fries but not worth the calories if not fresh.  Will go back the fish was fantastic
192	2	a	"I really hope Ada's does well but one does have to wonder as they're tucked back in a corner of a newer shopping center. Right down the street from Centennial High School so I'd think they'd get some lunch business from teachers and such to sustain them until the general public finds out about them. The sad part is once they are \""found\"" I'm afraid it may be a challenge to get a table.\n\nThe first thing after walking in and being acknowledged we were asked if we'd like to sample the Seafood Chowder... I highly suggest you say YES! Very tasty, but I was there on a mission for fish & chips so I'll do the chowder another day.\n\nStaff was very nice and helpful and since we were there between lunch and dinner hours the chef/owner-partner came out and chatted with us. \n\nHe was telling us about how when we came in he was right in the middle of breaking down (filleting) the fresh fish that was delivered and explained what fresh seafood they order in.\n\nI can't say enough about the seafood. Being born and raised in the SF bay area and working/playing in San Francisco and Half Moon Bay I've had some really great seafood. The food here rivals what I was used to eating at Hazels Seafood in Half Moon Bay, right off the boat!\n\nFish fillet was thinly coated then flash fried crisp, inside was flakey and perfectly done and served with two types of tartar sauce. My wife and I both preferred the spicy one. \nI highly suggest the Onion Rings instead of the fries or do a combo as they're  very,very good!\nPricing was fair considering the portion size and that it's FRESH fish. We ended up taking most of the fries/rings home as we couldn't stop eating the fish and it filled us up. \nYes, it's that good!"
193	1	a	I don't even want to give one star. Worst dining experience ever. EVER!! Got there at 700 p.m. ordered 2 waters, and an iced tea. Then the wait began....the waitress. ..rude and overworked...took our orders. There were only 3 of us. At 8:10 we were still sitting waiting for our burgers n fries. The waitresses were not anywhere to be found. I kept asking how much longer and she kept saying...I dont know..like...can you ask the cooks??? People were walking out left and right. The waitresses were meeting people at the door talking people out of staying. They told them to come back early afternoon when it is slower. What are we supposed to do for dinner tonight? They ran out of bacon, shoestring fries, pastrami, diet coke. Finally...we just left. I heard the waitresses apologizing to people with to go orders the whole time we sat there too. Never ever ever would I go here again. We were there for over an hour and in that time...only 1 table got their food. Get it together!  It is quite a drive in the middle of nowhere so I was hoping it would be a hidden gem. NOPE!!! This place has a lot to learn about running a restaurant and customer service. Save your gas!
194	2	a	We love this place! My husband and I have been 2 days in a row. We love that you can add as many toppings as you want for one set price. And the lemonade is seriously to die for!! Everyone was so friendly and awesome. We have found our new favorite pizza joint!!
195	2	a	Can't wait to return! \n\nStaff was BEYOND friendly, helpful, and polite (Cafe Rio could take a lesson). \n\nThe process was simple and quick. Next thing you know, we have our own personal pizzas! Fresh pizza and a drink for 2 for only $11.95!? Can't beat that. We can not wait to return.
196	2	a	We went in late and we were still greeted with smiles and fantastic serves. Great pizza and salad. Thank you
197	2	a	Great value and taste!! Simple menu with fresh food. Wish the refilling on beverage could be better. Otherwise I'd go back regularly. Oh! Make sure you take out the jalape\u00f1o in the sandwich if you don't like too much heat.
198	2	a	Some of the best Vietnamese food I've found in Charlotte.  Definitely the best Bahn Mi (pork sandwich), it had an amazing, fresh baked, crusty on the outside, chewy on the inside baguette with fresh cilantro, cucumber, jalape\u00f1o, daikon radishes, basil, carrots and bean sprouts on top of delicious, marinated, crispy grilled pork slices.  If you've never had Bahn mi before do yourself a favor and come here and order the Pork sandwich, you won't be disappointed.  Plus it is filling but not real heavy so perfect for lunch at work.  The Pho was also very good and the chicken fried rice was amazing.  Can't really say anything bad about this place.  The restaurant itself is really clean and new and the upstairs seating is very spacious.  EAT HERE!!!
199	2	a	"I first read about BRI on Yelp. I was intrigued by their motto. \""Doing beer research one pint at a time.\"" This turned out to be not entirely true since they have a sampler 4 pack so you can find the beer on their menu that you like. Personally I really liked the Citrana out of Tucson which is described as a wild sour ale.  The bartender, Jesse, asked what type of beers I liked when I first sat down. I wasn't helpful in telling her much but she picked 4 distinct types to give me a good choice for a second beer. \n\nI also tried the Silly Cheese Steak. The menu claims it is \""silly good\"". It was excellent as were the crispy fries that accompanied it. The steak was thinly sliced and there were crisp peppers and melted provolone cheese covering the steak. The roll was soft and tasty though I would prefer a crusty roll. \n\nThe only problem I had was finding the place. It is near the AMC theaters on Stapley. But I was expecting a stand alone building like the chain restaurants in that plaza. It is in the plaza building near the Starbucks. It was definitely worth looking for.\n\nI recommend you conduct your own research and remember to reward good service with a good tip."
200	1	a	I was trying to find something to eat and noticed Opa life had moved into the old big fat Greek. I decided to try them out and placed an order to go, 20 minutes later after I saw people who came in after receiving food and I was still waiting and losing time to eat before I had to start work again. I went up and asked what was going on and all I heard was sorry from the server not even the cook, or the person that took my order just the random server... From the time I complained my order it took them 3-4 minutes to get it in a bag and have me on my way. So they basically wasted almost half my lunch break because of unorganized individuals who didn't seem to care. The food was ok bit expensive, 1 chicken gyro and side salad was a little under 9 bucks. I prefer Pita Shack since it's better tasting and more cost effective AND they don't forget about my order and make me wait over 20 minutes for a chicken gyro and salad... I have them 2 stars because the server was really apologetic but I will not be going back.
201	2	a	Beautiful cafe at an amazing location. I love that I can walk here easily from my house. Food was delicious and the pop tart was awesome! My only complaint is that the coffee cups do not have handles, I felt like a dog trying to drink out of a water bowl. Not sure why they make you drink your coffee out of a soup bowl?! Food is great, service is superb, but I'll bring my own mug next time.
202	2	a	"Unique little spot. Cool atmosphere. Very short menu, limited options. Server indicated this is due to its \""farm to table\"" nature, and depends on availability of fresh ingredients. At any rate, seems they are a little late to the \""farm to table\"" game. That said, the food was good. Cinnamon toast is great, cool brunch item or almost a dessert. The bacon is thick and hearty. Shrimp on a roll was tasty. Wings were 'okay' - a potent taste and smell and not as fresh as some other items. Definitely worth a stop - very quaint place to catch some nibbles."
203	1	a	I want to love this place SOOOOO badly. But I just can't.\n\nI have visited three times now. 1st time: they were out of half the items on the menu. That's ok--they'd been open for a week. The food was pretty good, but I wasn't blown away. I liked the choice of sparkling or still water. The menu was a mess, though; basically just a list of ingredients for each item, leaving the presentation a mystery. The service was very good, though, especially for it being such a new place.\n\n2nd visit, a week or two later: out of half the menu again. Nothing that was left sounded that good. Waitress was snotty. We left and went to Fenwick's instead.\n\n3rd visit, this past weekend: we arrived at 11:20am. For the THIRD time in a row, they were out of the burger. (Already?!) We had the boule breakfast sandwich and the bison chorizo grits. The boule was good, but kind of bland. The grits were flavorless and hardly had any chorizo. The drip coffee was excellent, though, and the server (I think her name was Shannon) was wonderful. But, overall, it was yet another underwhelming experience. I don't think I'll give it a 4th try unless I hear they've stepped up their game. It's such a shame that such a beautiful restaurant with such a great concept manages to fall so flat.
204	2	a	Great place to hangout, with many amenities around the Towne and Country plaza. Great and friendly customer service with staff treating everyone with first class services, weather it's the first time or frequent customer. Complimentary coffee and water is a plus too!
205	2	a	Some of the best drinks in Las Vegas and Tater takes great care of you.  Amazing drinks and great help picking drinks.  Will be back next time we are in Las Vegas!
206	2	a	"Between myself and my husband, we've been to dozens of local and tourist bars all over the valley. I can, without a doubt, say that Oak & Ivy is the best bar I've ever been to! If you're looking for craft cocktails or even a beer, a great environment, and wonderful company, this is the place! You're welcome to read my (long) review below if you want to know more. \n\nThe Location: Located at the Container Park, which is only a block from Fremont, Oak & Ivy is close for tourists, but far enough away from the Vegas hustle and bustle for locals. During the day, all hard alcohol must stay on the premises, but you're able to walk around, shop, and eat if you're only having beer. Whether you want to explore the park, or hang out inside with other patrons and the bartenders, you'll have a good time!\n\nThe Staff: Every single bartender at Oak & Ivy is wonderful! They are all knowledgable and able to make whatever you throw at them. They are even willing and able to recommend cocktails you've never experienced based on your preferences. However, Pinto is my fav. He has proven that I can love gin and Bloody Mary's along with given me recommendations on how to \""wow\"" others when I make cocktails! Never had a bad convo or cocktail when I've stopped in!\n\nThe Drinks: Although they specialize in craft cocktails and whiskey, there is something for everyone here. Multiple beers are on tap and in bottles. They mix up they're menu with signature cocktails (like a pumpkin inspired Sleepy Hollow) and have they're most popular drinks like the coveted Moscow Mule with house made ginger beer. If you're feeling more inspired/adventurous, challenge them to make you something wild or let them decide on a drink for you! You simply can't go wrong."
207	1	a	"I'll openly admit that I haven't had much Filipino food, but the food I had here came with tons of bone fragments. Choking hazard, dental damage hazard, and simply not acceptable for restaurant food.\n\nNo signage, pricing, or menu available, just the dried-out and uncovered options at the buffet, labeled on the sneeze guard. I was handed a Styrofoam box to scoop my own rice from the cooker, and employee packed my two entr\u00e9es of chicken adobo and curry chicken. Limited options, all looked dry, was disappointed not to have any soup or lumpia. \n\n$6 total was small for the heavy box of food I received, but you get what you pay for. Chicken in both dishes was of low quality with a lot of gristle, and bone fragments were everywhere. Sauces for both dishes were understated and borderline bland, neither had any spice to it at all.\n\nThe buffet style doesn't lend itself to high expectations in the first place, but Fiesta Filipino manages a much higher quality with fresher food... and no bone fragments.\n\nEDIT: All you people posting 5-star reviews just because this place is \""so clean\"", apparently you regularly give your business to dirty restaurants?!  Sorry, upholding the health department code isn't enough for me."
208	1	a	I was really excited to try this new place.  Ordered the  Tonkasu assari combo with the gyoza and salad. Ramen noodles was good ,Soup just a little to salty. Pork is too thin and brakes apart. Decent size , I like it more then monta because monta give you so little noodles that  it doesnt fill you up. Salad was really bland. The dressing was garlic? Ginger? I dont know  what it was but it tasted like nothing,  all I taste is the oil. The gyoza was really bad. I mean I gyoza itself was good. The fillings was good but they cook mine with a dirty pan and the bottom isnt even crispy but its soft and black from a dirty pan. I whipe it on a napkin and it was all black. I dont know ill go back , maybe I more try.
209	1	a	Food is good, The management is horrible. The girl Tomimi or whatever her names is. Doesn't have a clue on what she is doing. The service is kind of slow. I ate there twice and both times The next day didn't feel so good.. My stomach was acting up. I wouldn't recommend this place. I would rather eat at Monta until the management gets better. My servers when I ate there were Brittany and Keoni. They were really great . They kept checking up on me and really seem like they knew what they were doing. The guy always made sure I had drinks and made sure everything was alright real great hospitality.. The girl did the same they worked really well this was the second day they opened. The next time I went there I got a different server who did alright he left me hanging a couple times which is the reason I feel this place deserves a lower rating. Foods good management not really and some servers are good some aren't so much. If you go there ask for Brittany or keoni I think that's what his name was.
210	2	a	A worthy addition to LV Ramen community (namely Monta and Sora)
211	1	a	Personally, I didnt really like it here. Its loud and so dark I had to out my phone to read the menu. There also wasnt anything on the menu I was dying to try. Food was bland; you could tell they made their everything extra spicy and salty to hide the fact that the base of everything had little to no flavor. The soup didnt have any depth to it. Service was good, and thats about the only thing I can compliment them on.
212	2	a	I stumbled upon this place because my cousin told me we should try it.  We always have been going to Monta since it was one of the places for Ramen that we liked.  The only problem with them that it is way too salty for my taste plus the place was so tiny I felt so claustrophobic.  I am not one for cramped spaces.  \n\nMy husband is an especially picky eater, especially with Asian food, but he loves this.  I think he finally found a place that he cannot get sick of.  They offer such a variety of food that you cannot go wrong.  I love the ambiance of the restaurant.  Very cozy and casual.\n\nThe staff is on point when it comes to filling our drinks.  That is one of my biggest peeves is when the servers do not fill my drinks on a timely manner, but they do and I love it!  They are seriously on point when it comes to greeting us when we first come in.  \n\nMy usual order is the Tonkotsu Asari.  Thank you BTW for not making salty.  I have a sensitive palatte so I am glad that you are able to add flavor without making me an enormous amounts of water.  My husband gets the Tonkotsu Spicy which he makes super hot.  It looks delicious, but I do not do spicy foods.  I think you guys made me a lover for the Takoyaki (Octopus Balls) and the Pork Chashu Bowl.  Yum!  \n\nThis is definitely a place that we can eat with our friends and family.  My husband, cousin, and I are going to be regulars here.  People should seriously try this place out.  I cannot rave enough about this place.
213	2	a	Me and the boy went nuts at this place!!!  So glad it opened so close to the Vegas homestead and so glad it is open until 3am.  This is a very hip place to dine in the wee hours with very patient and helpful service along with some very fantastic food!\nI swear we ordered one of everything on the menu.  The pork bun was a perfect little size with deliciously fatty pork tucked inside.  The brussel sprouts were hot and satisfying and the ramen was so good that I couldn't get it in my face fast enough. I am pretty sure which any way you order your ramen, it is going to come out awesome.\nThis place is kinda of small but the service is swift so there usually is one table available.
214	1	a	"In their defense, I will open this review by saying they have only been in this location for a week. HOWEVER, they ran a business at another location so that \""learning curve\"" thing should not apply.  The atmosphere is not there yet and that is okay - they gotta get the furniture and decor going but first things first - food and drink and servers.\n\nWe came after reading so many good reviews of their Phoenix location - and with LivingSocial in hand.\n\nIt is apparent that they still need to figure out how to run the front side of their business - there were 6 tables occupied with 3 servers, a bartender, two management types - and i think it was the owner that came out of the kitchen and took our beverage order.  Really? And those servers were running like chickens without heads.\n\nWe tried to figure out what the coupon covered but couldn't get a straight answer so we just ordered 2-meat combos with one side each.  The brisket was a $2 upcharge so we ordered pulled pork and brisket, one with slaw, the other mac and cheese.\n\nUnfortunately, I think they had to go chase that damn pig down (not the cow, for heavens' sake - those animals are slow and there is no chasing involved) because it took 50 minutes to get our dinner. 50 minutes. almost an hour. now, let's think about this.  that meat was already smoked. the mac should have already been made. and the same with the slaw. what would take 50 minutes? i have no flipping idea. \n\nWhen the meals came, they both had mac and slaw. I said something to the server who said well that's how they come. Sigh. If we had known they were coming with two sides, I would not have gotten slaw with my mac and my hubs would not have gotten mac with his slaw.  This is like the story of the Reese's peanut butter cup with not such a sweet ending LOL  And....no bbq sauce.  Hmmm. Let me see.  BBQ restaurant. Ordered BBQ.  Maybe you want to put some on the plate?\nIn their defense, they brought it upon request.....in a teenie tiny little salad dressing cup...... bwahahahaha..... \n\nPulled pork was nicely seasoned. Tasted like a shoulder to me.  Good and smoky. Moist. Little bit of charing on the outside.  That cow, however, did not fare nearly as well. If the poor fellow would have known that is how he would have ended up, he would have fought harder at that slaughterhouse - or at least tried to run a little faster. That brisket was well on the way to jerky-dom when we got it. And - it was tasteless. Seriously. No smoke. No rub. No moist. Just dry meat. So pork yes, beef no.\n\n Slaw? Meh. Very mayo-ish with not much else. I am a creamy slaw girl myself and still make it the way mom did at the restaurant.  I figured it for a southern slaw place but they apparently ran out of celery seed that day as there were maybe 3 seeds in a serving so it was a rather lackluster slaw. \n\nMac was.......odd.  It was cheesy  No egg. Not a baked mac. But it was REALLY greasy. I know that mac can be that way depending on the cheese you use. Mine had a large puddle of grease in the bottom of the monkey dish - however, the hubs' didn't. Proof positive that sometimes the grass is greener - or at least less greasy - on the other side of the fence.\n\nSauce? Not my favorite. I think it was a home-cooked sauce as it had that shiny cornstarch kind of look maybe - but it was perhaps too cumin-y for my taste and hubs wasn't so keen on it. So maybe that is why they serve it in a teenie cup cause that is enough. I ended up spreading the mac on my meat since I had nothing else.\n\nSo now the bill comes. Here's where it gets more interesting. The deal was for 2 dinners with sides and beverages.  The value of the deal was $36.  Our bill came to $28.  The server presents us a bill where we are given $18.95 credit - so we owed $9+. Wait a minute. Let's do that math again. They must have gone thru the Common Core teaching program as in my mind $36 is greater than $28.  In their defense, after I said \""no, try again\"" they decided that we were square. Sigh. What was that all about? Had I not opened my mouth, we would have ended up paying $50 for two $15 dinners plus sodas. Nice markup if you can get it.... here's a novel suggestion: if you are going to run a deal, then figure it out BEFORE your customers get there then teach your servers how to handle them. Don't offer a deal then go - duh, we have no idea what to do with it.\n\nI wanted to like this place. Really, I did. We have a meetup group and I am always looking for small businesses that we can intro our members to - but this, sadly, is not one of them. Off in search of local places for our next dinner......"
215	2	a	Have been wanting to try this place for a while and finally made it. Arrived early enough on a Saturday where there will still a good selection of donuts. I am a purist and love a good glazed donut so I opted for that. I wanted to try another flavor but to donuts are HUGE and for the price didn't want to throw away a 1/2 eaten donut. The donut itself is very cake-like, the glaze had good flavor and was not overly sweet and the donut was not overly glazed. I took a few bites and left the rest sitting in the car while I ran some errands. A while later I decided to have some more donut and letting it sit in the warm car was the key to donut heaven! After sitting the glaze soaked into the donut and they were both nice and warm.. even the BF agreed it was even better than earlier. I can only imagine what a fresh from the kitchen donut tasted like there, drooling thinking about it.\nThe prices are higher than a DD or KK, but you are paying for local ingredients, locally made product and not some pre-fab box/bag filled with ingredients you cannot pronounce donut. I suggest following them on FB so you can look at yummy donut of the day photos and most importantly know when they have sold out!
216	2	a	I park at Aaron's as often as possible. I only didn't give it 5 stars due to lack of space. They really should look into expanding.  Having that bouncer Lincoln does keep everyone in line so even though it's crowded no one gets out of control. I've met some really great people here. Will definitely keep coming back.
217	2	a	I had close to a 18 inch crack in my front windshield. Initially took it to Safelite and the quote to replace the entire windshield was pretty high. I shopped around Yelp and found Mike's, who quoted me roughly $100 less than Safelite so I gave him a try. \n\nI had no problems scheduling the appt, which I later had to reschedule. He was very accommodating to my schedule. There was no extra charge for him to come out to my condo and replace my windshield. It's been 3 weeks and I've found no issues with the work. Would highly recommend.
218	2	a	So excited to be close to a Sprouts again. Their produce is wonderful, and inexpensive. Love the music playing from speakers in the parking lot. I was pleasantly surprised to see how large this store is. Many checkout lanes as well. \nThey were making sushi right in the store, and the quality looked top notch. Had to get some. Yum! Also got some frozen beef tamales, as recommended by another customer. They were amazing! Besides the veggies, I love their bulk spices. I found those over by the baking aisle on an end cap. Along with spices, they also had a few different loose teas. Very affordable. \nCan't wait to come here again next week!
219	1	a	I ordered the chicken marsala burger and I do not recommend it, it was soggy and had a weird texture. My boyfriend ordered the black and blue burger, it was just average. The fries were delicious and they have good dipping sauces. The staff was very friendly and the service was quick but the food was just OK.
220	1	a	"This eatery opened July 21st. This is the first visit my partner and I  had at this restaurant. I ordered the shrimp burger and he ordered the Bacon Cheeseburger, with one order of large fries. We were expecting a great experience, based on the reviews that are here on Yelp, what we got was a mediocre experience at best. The Shrimp burger was great...great taste, excellent consistency, a very good choice, the bacon cheeseburger was dry. The order of fries in our opinion did not represent the large order that we had expected, and to make things worse, they were practically cold. We did speak with a \""mover\"" (Burger 21 speak) and although he  was not apologetic, we did receive another order of fries shortly thereafter. The fries, unlike some reviews on here are nothing to write home about. When the dining experience was over, we did have 2 staff members come up to us, and ask us how we liked it. I gave them honest reviews, telling them that given the overall experience, it is nothing more than an upscale McDonalds. I think that they are focusing on  the many sauces they offer, some of which are downright weird, and the many shakes they have, not focusing on the main product. Even the napkins they give out are very chintzy. One staff member was open to the feedback, offering us free dessert, while the other member, a member of management openly disagreed with my comments, and even stated that the chef would not like to hear what we had to say. Overall, we decided that it was not horrible, but yet, we would not recommend this restaurant, and would not go out of our way to return."
221	2	a	I love this place! They get my brows perfect every time,  and they are so sweet and polite.
222	2	a	"Great place.  Brought in two jackets that were no longer wearable and now they look wonderful.  The \""alteration\"" was done quickly and at a very reasonable price.  I would highly recommend."
223	1	a	"I called to place an order for delivery and the guy simply stated \""we have a $30 minimum and you have to place the order through grub hub\"" and then hung up. Congratulations on losing a customer before ever even earning one."
224	1	a	This place sucks. It's McDonald's plus 30% price increase.  Want a good burger,  plenty of other places around.
225	1	a	I'm a picky eater with almost all my foods, I just wanted a bean beef and cheese burrito. My girlfriend asked if there's onions and peppers in it the girl at the register assured us that there was not. My burrito was ordered and my girlfriend had ordered a carne asada burrito and we left. \n\nAfter arriving home I open the box and there's a few soggy chips in there, I take a bite and it's riddled with peppers and onions. After a 4 hour drive home, and stopping for a quick food pickup on my way the last thing I wanted to do was get in my car and go back so I tried picking it all out, I soon gave up. My girlfriend was far from impressed by her burrito too.  \n\nSo I think with this being a $16 waste of money that makes us one time customers. Unfortunately.
226	1	a	Not good, overall just not good. We had a large group and our poor server seemed so overwhelmed. She actually did a good job getting everyone's orders but then who knows what happened in the kitchen. Half the table never got any food at all, some of us decided not even to order entrees because it took so long for anything to come out. I did get to eat the gravy fries which were actually very tasty. A little too much salt but still liked it. The Mac n cheese was side order size and something I could have made myself. It was decent but nothing to get excited about so whoever wrote the menu is just really good about describing things in a fanciful way. \n\nNow the chicken tenders. I heard the waitress telling someone else that they were so popular they made an adult version. I love chicken tenders so I ordered them. It was like cardboard microwaved chicken. Took 2 bites and sent it back. I was in shock. Chicken tenders are usually so good to me because of the different ways that restaurants bread and fry em up. The tots were like what you get at elementary school lunch. I'm sorry union but for kids maybe okay, the only adults who would eat that are ones who are too drunk to notice what you just put in front of them. \n\nLocation and decor is great. Figure out your kitchen timing, revisit some of the menu items and this place could be really successful.
227	1	a	"I hovered between 2 and 3 stars and finally settled on 2 stars cause well, no one likes to feel ignored and brushed off!!!\nIt was the grand opening party for Union Barrelhouse and the place was hopping!!!  A fantastic sign for any opening of a restaurant!!!  My son and I were greeted warmly at the door and being Yelpers, were presented with a gift bag at the door (thanks!)  then we sampled their grilled chicken with mozzarella, tomato, basil sandwich which was delish.  We got there at 7pm, they must have had an opening for VIP guests cause even though the event invite said 7pm till close, when we got there a little before 7pm, 95% of the complimentary sampling were gone.  \nNO BIG DEAL- we werent' there just for the free food, we came to support this restaurant (must be the same owner as Salty Senorita) so after we greeted fellow Yelpers Irene V., Laura I, Travis B., and the gang, my son and I looked for a patio table cause we wanted to sit down and have dinner. \nZzzzzz as in the place was buzzing but our waitress was not to be found.  Finally I accosted one and she told me she would be right with me . . . 15 mins later . . . no big deal- there was soccer on tv so we watched the game . . . when she came, we ordered our food- kid's meal chicken tenders with fruit and a farm market salad . . . easy pizy order.\nThen we waited and waited- my son who was very hungry kept asking where the food was . . . I accosted my waitress and asked- she said it would be right up.\n(As in, palm in face- don't talk to me, can't you see I'm busy??)  I was understanding- I mean, the place was packed!!!\nWe waited sooooo long that in between waiting my son had time to enter a grilled cheese eating contest where he had 5 minutes to eat 9 grilled cheese sandwiches (which by the way, was very fun)- I don't know how long the contest took- 30 mins?  \nBy the time we got back to our table, our food was still not ready!!!  10 mins later the food comes, the waitress hurriedly throws the food down on the table and just runs away . . . I didn't even get the chance to tell her she gave my son tater tots instead of the fresh fruit side he ordered.  Finally I had to chase her down and accost her again and she said, \""oops, I'll bring it right out . . . \""\n30 mins later we were still waiting!!!  My son kept asking where his fresh fruit was.\nFinally I chased her down and accosted her AGAIN and this time I asked her to talk to the manager to comp'd our meal for the evening.\nThis is the first time ever in my prolific string of dining experiences where I had to consistently chase down the server- I might have logged a 1/4 of a mile chasing her down!!!  You get the picture.\nThe manager came and was very friendly and apologetic and willingly comp'd our meal.  \nIn terms of pricing, it was $10 for my salad which was medium sized portion, fresh, loved the balsamic vinegarette reduction but I thought it was a bit pricey for the portion and atmosphere of the place.  The chicken tender kid's meal pretty ordinary- nothing to write home about.\nAtmosphere is great, food ordered okay, service received epic fail.  Manager very understanding and friendly.  Not sure I would come back again."
228	1	a	"I gave this place 3 tries because I really wanted to like it. The first time my boyfriend and I went it reminded me of one of the many breweries in Southern California that we are fond of. Unfortunately, the service was lacking. We sat at the bar during a slow time, but it still took several minutes to get our orders taken, and our water glasses were often empty. When we received the wings, I took a bit out of a particularly thick one and it was clearly underdone. I asked the waitress to bring it to the chef, and she came back, relaying that they said it was because it was \""dark meat\"". I'm not an idiot; I know what raw chicken looks like. She took it off our bill though, which was nice.\n\nThe second time, it was more of the same. We sat at the bar for quite a long time before getting our drink orders filled, more time for our food orders, and our waters were mostly empty. This was all while watching the three or four managers (all dressed  in ridiculous vests and ties with enormous beards) walk around being busy without being productive. Basically, carrying clean glasses from one shelf to another, talking to each other, and never once turning their attention to the customers sat at the bar right in front of them. After awhile, another bartender took over and she was really great. She talked to us for quite awhile and made us feel welcome and appreciated. \n\nAs far as the food, I asked for dressing on the side and yet one of the vested/bearded managers poured it on right in front of me. The salad I ordered also came without the two ingredients I was looking forward to (bacon and seasoned croutons). After several minutes of waiting to get the attention of a manager or bartender, they finally noticed me. However, he seemed like he did not believe me that I was missing the ingredients (you don't know your own food?!?)\n\nFinally, tonight I took advantage of a Groupon. I ordered a burger, my boyfriend ordered the gravy fries. The food took almost an hour to come out. The burger was okay, fries were semi-cold. But the real problem came when I gave the Groupon to our server. She came back with a bill that the 30 dollars had been taken off of, however it was the completely wrong bill. I tried to show the waitress and her idea of \""fixing\"" it was to run my card for the original amount (sans Groupon). At this point I was pissed. I had been sitting in this restaurant for almost 2 hours, and wanted to go. When I pointed out her mistake she took the bill back. When I saw her again, instead of bringing me my fixed bill, she was taking the order of the table next to us! Finally, a manager came over who had finally fixed the mistake. He addressed all of his comments to my boyfriend, not me, which pissed me off because I was paying. (At least address both of us if you don't know who's credit card you have in your hand.) After all of this, we weren't even offered anything for our trouble! I honestly couldn't believe it. For a restaurant that obviously views itself as somewhat upscale, its service was completely awful. \n\nThird time was not a charm. I doubt this place will be around for long, especially when there are so many quality restaurants/bars in the area. I will not be back again."
229	1	a	We have been there for three times, each time they just gave us less and less noodles in the soup, we had to order extra noodles.  Their beef noodle soup taste good, but the portion is so small my 3 year old can finish it in no time. The fried noodles is the same, small portion!  Won't go back again!
230	2	a	Thai Style Noodle House has always caught my eye since regular at Liu same shopping mall. Thai food is definitely one of my favorites. So was excited about coming in for lunch and trying some of the food.\n\nI ordered the Chicken and Shrimps Silver Noodles. I was in the mood for a nice hearty noodle dish for lunch. This dish delivered on point!!! They were not skimpy on the protein either chicken or shrimp, nice amount of vegetables from bean sprouts, carrots, cabbage, and the clear noodles again nice portion size. I really liked the sauce not really heavy gravy sauce but more light sauce. Not over powering. All the vegetables had nice crunch, al dente, and looked eye appealing just looking at it. It reasonable price. Menu is pretty diverse with lots of pictures just in case not sure.\n\nThe service was excellent. I got seated soon as I walked in. Never had empty glass. The decor is pretty interesting. It had bland look too it. Sure the walls are painted so nothing like cafeteria style. On one side of the walls there couple widescreen televisions. Other then that and one sculpture that sit on the counter. Odd. Yet they have modern look between the light fixtures above and the seats. If you walk in never think going into Thai restaurant. Good or bad? It all about the food for me. In Thai Style Noodle House case am FAN. No doubt plan on making it regular lunch spot for me and trying more of the menu.
231	2	a	My experience was great! The staff was so so friendly and very helpful! Will definitely be going back!!
232	2	a	No, no.... I am not dreaming.... Postino Tempe (Postino Annex) is NOW OPEN! Only a few minute walk from my front door now lays before me the miracle of $5 Wine (or pitchers of Beer) until 5pm and the best Bruschetta in town. I'm a HUGE fan - dating back to when there was just Postino Arcadia - and all I can say is that Tempe residents just got LUCKY!! Built in the historic Art Annex Building surrounded by all things Tempe. LOVE.\n\nBruschetta. Panini. Soup. Salad. Cheese board. Meat board. Olives. Awesome.\n\nBruschetta: Ricotta with Dates & Pistachios (sweet) and Salami with Pesto or Burrata, Bacon, Arugula & Tomato (savory) but you honestly can't go wrong with any of them! Don't pass up the Seasonal either, it's always a winner. Postino is best enjoyed eating/sharing items off the menu for several hours in good company. Italian Picnic? It's an amazing salad - and you'll feel like you're having one...\n\nThey are all about their wine, so you can't pick a wrong one. Feeling frisky? Let them recommend one based on your preference. I've done it before and been pleasantly surprised. I wasn't a fan of Bordeaux - but I tried one per their recommendation and ended up loving it. Prost!\n\nPostino service is always top notch. They just get it. You won't find yourself with just one server, there are multiple of them checking in on you consistently and the service is always flawless. I never feel rushed. The food is consistent and timely. Always.\n\nTonight I had the pleasure of dining on the patio. The weather is just starting to cool off and the patio is lovely. Lush and green, cozy and sweet. Whether at Arcadia, Central, Gilbert or Tempe - there is a shared feeling amongst them all - the spaces are comfortable and I can always guarantee a fabulous evening and meal. The music is never too loud, it's the perfect place for good company and great conversations. Yes - I live in Tempe. No - I am not a college student and haven't been for a long time. I've matured - and now, apparently, Tempe has too!\n\nPolish off perfection with a Salted Caramel Sundae and there is no way you can leave without a smile. If this is for some reason a dream, please don't wake me...
233	1	a	The food was alright, not the best sandwich I've had but it tasted good. I don't understand why they only serves one size sandwiches. Most of the staff was decent and well mannered. However I will never return here as long as that bald guy works here. He was completely unprofessional to my girlfriend and rude to both of us. If that is their idea of customer service, I do not want to experience it ever again. Best thing about the area it is in is there are plenty of other places to eat.
234	2	a	By far the best dental experience of my life!!  Everyone is amazingly helpful and friendly from the front office to the assistants to the dentist.  You even get to watch movies or TV while you get work done!!  There is also a kids side with movies and video games.  This place is great for adults and kids.  I highly recommend this dental office.
235	2	a	My boyfriend and I stumbled upon this gem of a ice cream shop after dinner. What perfect after dinner desert options this place has to offer.\nWe had the privilege of getting served by the owners. They were very personable and knowledgable. \nWhat a great concept, non-GMO, Organic deliciousness.  Come out and support this local, organic and conscious shop. You will surly enjoy every bite.
236	1	a	"Cobblestone bought out the locally owned car wash at this location, and it has gone downhill ever since. The prices have increased, the service is iffy, and if you go there in a typical weekend expect to wait 30-45 minutes to get your car.   There are employees everywhere, but only 1 guy working on each car. \n\nIn addition, they have the prototypical \""car salesman\"" out front hounding you to upgrade, get a wax, detail etc etc. I am done going to this place."
237	2	a	Friendly staff (of they are from Pittsburgh!!!) After parking my car after I dropped it off, they pulled it back out of the garage and drove me to the Megabus pickup site at the Convention. Also the weekend rate $9.99/day was SO WORTH IT!!!
238	1	a	Saw owner opening walmart chocolate chip cookies, and then repackaging them as their cookies, yuck! When they opened their first store it was great, but over the years the flavors have changed and the chicken is bone dry. Any grocery store rotisserre chicken is better. Ordered 1/2 rack ofribs  for $13.49 , they gave me 4 ratty looking ribs. Mashed potatoes are so bland. Gave this new store a chance but, not going back.
239	1	a	This place is basically a fast food place posing as a casual upscale restaurant. The  prices are comparable to Church's, Pollo Loco etc. And the other reviews are accurate - Chicken is okay, white chicken is a little dry but that is what you can expect from white chicken. The ribs are what really slide this restaurant down the drain. The ribs are not good, fatty with no meat, and overcooked. They had an identity crisis and should have just focused on chicken. I was pretty disappointed overall. If you view this place more of a fast food joint, as opposed to a casual upscale, it will help with expectations and your experience will be more enjoyable. You can't trust ribs from a fast food joint.
240	2	a	Come see mike, great bbc and incredible service. The hands down best potatosald and some of the best chicken chill soup around.
241	1	a	The airport location gives the stand alone locations a really bad name. We go to the Scottsdale location frequently and love it there. This was our first time trying the airport location. I got the most pathetically small and dry chicken wings. They didn't taste good at all. The rice in the rice & beans was severely undercooked. When I went to the counter to replace it with something else, three employees walked right past me without asking if I needed help. I finally had to flag someone down. I replaced the rice & beans with potato salad. The potato salad seemed as if it was just taken out of the freezer.  \n\nI can't imagine this place will last very long at the airport. If they don't close the doors themselves, I'm sure Sky Harbor will kick them out eventually.
242	1	a	"Due to an unavoidable emergency I recently had to cancel my family's holiday trip to Las Vegas. I realized I would lose my deposit of a 1 night's stay. I called the reservations number to cancel and was treated with the finest customer service, even expressing regret that we had to cancel our trip and inviting us to please come back soon. Within the hour I received a statement of the settlement of my cancellation. Unfortunately things did not go well from that point forward. The amount refunded to me was not correct according to the settlement statement and when I called to inquire about it, I got \"" Tanya\"" in accounting. Tanya refused to give me her last name and after requesting to speak to someone else or a supervisor THREE times- she continued to be rude and told me no one else could help me, refusing to transfer me other than to say she could transfer me back to reservations. (Obviously reservations wasn't able to resolve an accounting error.)\nI had heard this was a classy hotel and expected to be treated with basic courtesy- nope!! Just rude Tanya. Best wishes to you, Tanya. I hope that when you have a legitimate customer service issue of your own, you are connected with someone kinder and more pleasant than you to resolve the issue. The Palazzo should be ashamed to have someone so rude and unprofessional working in accounting. Check your credit card receipts folks- TANYA is processing them!!!!!"
243	2	a	We had a great time there, I had an issue with a venue that was happening in the hotel that then the security guy from Palazzo stepped in , he was the nicest guy and went out of his way to solve the issue , his name was ZEV and thanks to him we could go on with our night.. Very polite and friendly staff, strongly recommend this hotel.  If you go to vegas this is where you should stay...
244	1	a	Do not trust these guys.  When I put down $500 to buy a 2001 Mercedes 230SLK, it had four new Pirelli tires on it. During the purchase process, they had me sign something that said I was buying the car with the equipment it had on it, but when I picked it up, it had four mismatched, crappy tires. These guys would rip off their own mothers! Buyer beware.
245	1	a	"I have heard many things about Korean Fried Chicken... \""life changing\"", \""orgasmic\"", \""so good it will make you drop kick your mother, twice\""...and \""jolly good!\""\n\nThat being said, I was not the least bit recalcitrant to visit this new entrant into the Pittsburgh food scene, when it was brought to my attention by Maren V. Venturing back into the proverbial \""old stomping grounds\"" of the University of Pittsburgh, and navigating the myriad of Sperry wearing, sweatpants clad undergrads, we entered the small and crowded establishment. Following a not so brief wait, we placed an order for soy garlic wings. We were informed, there were no drumsticks available. Tears. The order was delivered in a respectably prompt fashion. As a bonus, they had finger condoms ( is there a better name for these things?) if you are a Monk-esque having two hands dirty at the same time-a phobe, like myself. \n\nLets get to the wings, shall we? The first bites for a KFC virgin such as myself were confusing to say the least. I had heard these were to be double fried, and crispy, yet tender. I detected no difference to regular chicken wings to be honest. The sauce was almost sickeningly sweet, yet lacking in any subtle distinction of flavor. Some were crispy, some were almost soggy. \n\nIn all honesty, I threw about 8 away. I never throw food away. I generally eat everyone elses leftovers because I am fat as f***. \n\nI might chalk it up to being extremely busy, but I really dont have desires to give a second chance. I must find KFC elsewhere."
246	1	a	This place is the stereotypical cheesy car lot. We had a real nice salesman Ruben, who was pleasurable to deal with and had plenty of patience with us. We mentioned we were just looking but he said a sales manager wanted to talk to us. It turned out we had to deal with two pushy sales manager who tried to get us in a brand new car we didn't like that much to begin with. They could not comprehend the words we are not buying anything today and needed to talk more about it.  They found a way to push us to the point where if they had the last car lot in town, the bus would be a better option. Not worth dealing with this dealership with there being plenty of other options in the valley.
247	2	a	WOW!! This food is SO GOOD!!! Thank you for the AMAZING fried rice & egg rolls. Loved it all!! The egg rolls have the perfect flaky crust. Highly recommend. We had this sticky rice before that is FABULOUS as well. Reasonably priced, too.
248	1	a	Stopped in for a pedi after work, was lured by their 50% off banner. Got say the worst pedi I've ever gotten! \n\nThe water was cold, the lady didn't massage my feet. I guess you can say she applied lotion at the very least. Although I had to rub it in, and to add to it my polish chipped in just 4 days!
249	2	a	Johnny is awesome, the food is great, and at a very reasonable price. I love the homemade chips and the variety of salsas especially the hot stuff. Johnny usually has the food up in two to three minutes and it's fresh and piping hot. I highly recommend this place.
250	1	a	Never has customer service and competency been so bad...never. Wasted my time, money...no apologies. No compensation. By the end of a frustrating two day experience, I simply cancelled everything.
251	2	a	Yummm love this place! I thought it closed but found out from a friend they just moved, THANKFULLY! Their angus beef, chicken, and gyoza are my favorite. Numm numm and love their sauce bar for dipping;)
252	2	a	Love this place tried to go to the old one but it was closed so happy about their new location!!!
253	2	a	Eggstasy restaurant is finally open! Had a nice, BIG, breakfast there this morning, just to be sure.  The hash browns are the best, nice mix of crunch and generous seasoning for excellent flavor. The Benedict with crispy prosciutto was recommended by my server and was a great selection, prosciutto was thinly sliced and cooked up like bacon, only crispier, and smokier. The poached egg (just the very teensiest, slightest bit underdone) and hollandaise (very lemony, yum!), over a monster of an English muffin from a local bakery. Portions were HUGE - half of my Bene and most of the hash browns are in the fridge for tomorrow. Service was excellent! Hostess, waiter (Junior), co-owner/manager, and water servers were very attentive, friendly, anxious to please, and delighted to share all the details on anything related to the menu or local restaurant biz. Like that the terrific and spongy English muffin came from Strictly From Scratch bakery, who are also the suppliers for Scramble and recently bought Chompie's. Who knew?\nCan't wait to return and try some of the funky crepes and omelets on offer!\nAlso:  Coffee is strong and good and plentiful, but needs to come with a spoon for stirring in cream.
254	2	a	Love this place. It's bright, sunny, and modern inside with an excellent menu. The service is lovely and coffee to die for. They even have stevia on the tables. The manager is warm and friendly and remembered I'd ordered their lovely gluten-free protein pancakes on my previous visit, and today just brought me some for dessert, his treat. These nice touches will keep me coming back. Happy to see this place and can't wait for the patio to open.
255	2	a	Eggstasy was the place picked for October's Breakfast Club UYE, and this place does things big! They leave you feeling full and satisfied and well in eggstasy.\n\n1st off, you notice it's a huge menu for a breakfast joint, this place does not mess around,  they have soo much to offer and many choices were made, so I did get a chance to check out a lot of plates and boy they looked great! \n\nI went with the Incredible omelet, it was loaded with green peppers, mushrooms, tomatoes, onions, BACON, ham and sausage, it was HUGE!!! No really it was huge, and it came with hash browns and I opted for pancakes instead of toast.\n\nI didn't realize it was going to be huge, this was something that could have been spilt between 2, but I was starving and did eat my entire omelet, just couldn't put a dent in my pancakes.  This a great breakfast place, and breakfast is there thing. \nI already can't wait to get back to try the many other things on the menu!
256	2	a	Ate here the other day for breakfast and oh my was it wonderful. Had the Dali and my boyfriend had the gypsy. They both were amazing. And it's very hard to impress him and he loved it. We will be going back for sure.
257	1	a	Meh.  Seems like they're trying to do too much.  Nothing really jumped out as amazing.  Won't be back.
258	1	a	"After going here for breakfast on Saturday mornings (mostly), for months now, I'm sorry to say we've seen a decline. The food was great when they first opened, but now it's sliding backwards. The corned beef hash was sooo amazing for a couple of visits, but then even the owner, Peter, said he didn't understand why it started tasting so dry and vinegary. Oh,well. We'd just find a new menu item, right?\n\nI switched to the skirt steak, which is now a great cut of meat, but they always, and I mean always burn the outside. Too much \""char\"" in that \""broil\"" for either of us. I found myself having to trim a LOT of meat off just to get the black bits off. They taste really bad.\n\nSo, today, we went yet again (boyfriend is determined to make this place work, lol) and I just skipped the meat items and had their normally amazing hash browns, their multi-grain toast, and a couple of poached eggs. The hash browns were dry and over done, the toast was fine, and the eggs tasted odd. I think it's the seasoning they now use. Not sure if the green in my eggs was cilantro or parsley, but it's not good for me. I always ask for the eggs poached hard and sometimes they are, or one is, or neither is. lol It's really hit and miss with the food now. And I am finding myself just deciding that I'd rather miss the whole thing.\n\nThe food issues are added to the continuing lack of sound buffering on the ceiling or floor or walls. When we first started going back in September when they opened, we cut them the slack all new restaurants should get...they are working things out, right? Yet at Eggstasy, they've got tracks in the ceiling for acoustic tiles, but still no tiles. The cavernous loft layout, plus the House Music (I'm not kidding), with nothing to absorb the noise makes for one deafening experience. Plus, we were freezing more than usual this morning as it was about 46 degrees outside and they wouldn't turn the heater on, apparently. I asked, and the staff said the owner won't do it, ever. It is hardly a cozy place for breakfast on a chilly day. Our server told us that no matter how cold it's been, the owner insists that their huge wall windows get rolled up by 9 a.m. Yikes. It's a neat feature during the warmer months, but not now. They were trying to do a patio service at the same time. Brrrr!\n\nSo, we sat there chilly in a very noisy space, yelling back and forth, with sub-par food. \n\nSuch a bummer. This place has potential to be amazing, but it's like they stopped trying.\n\nThe one really bright spot left is the staff themselves. ALWAYS cheerful (even the brunette Barbies that seat you. lol) and professional. Sadly, though, that can't make up for chill, noise, and spotty food."
259	1	a	Sadly this place has gone downhill since my last visit.Quite simply there is a lack of management and expediting in the kitchen. Also they are skimping; for example fewer ingredients in an omelette. Sadly, they are no longer competitive with other venues . The patio is very pleasant. Their pancakes used to be great; now they are hardly  edible  .
260	1	a	Beratungskompetenz gleich Null, die Mitarbeiter sind teils unfreundlich. Sind sie mal in einem Gespr\u00e4ch mit einem Kunden, schieben sich auch gern andere Kunden beiseite, die sich grad f\u00fcr das selbe Produkt interessieren und im Weg stehen. Nur hingehen, wenn man genau wei\u00df, was man will.
261	1	a	"I have been ordering from this company since 2001. Back then everything was great. Somewhere along the line it has turned into a complete cluster. Rounded corners come inconsistent and octagonal. Definitely NOT round. The product is never delivered by the date provided & when it comes it's usually incorrect. I've had colored prints come in black & white. I've had big streaks & discolorations running down postcards. The rounded corner issue mentioned above. No one ever knows anything & you always get tossed around from person to person until someone stumbles on a solution by chance. I've had more reprints than actual orders. The best is when they contact you 4 days after the scheduled delivery (expedited shipping) to say they \""lost the artwork\"". Shouldn't something like that be addressed???  This company is a joke. Go somewhere else even if the cost is double."
262	2	a	First of all... Ninos by far deserves these 5 stars! This place is the epitome of why I LOVE local, hole-in-the-wall restaurants. Before I get into the delicious food, their service is exceptional. From order to walking out, these business owners know how to treat their customers. \n\nA friend of mine was craving legit Greek food when I stumbled upon this Yelp profile and Ninos was conveniently down the street from us. This place is probably in a more remote area of the Biltmore area, along 16th Street. It is a charming house with a good amount of tables inside and some bench tables outside. Our party of 7 were the only patrons at the time, so were served in a timely manner and all our food came out in about 15 minutes which to me is great considering our party and number of orders. I believe our party ordered pretty much every single platter on the menu (gyro, lamb, chicken breast, falafel) and each platter comes with pita bread, salad, rice, AND fries with side of tzatziki sauce for less than $10 each. I had the pleasure of trying each platter (yes, I'm THAT person) and oh my goodness... SO SO GOOD! Every meat has great flavor and every element on the platter is delicious and fresh. \n\nHere's what sets Ninos apart: they made a mistake on my order of a gyro plate, or rather they did not hear it. Everyone else had got their food and when I asked if my gyro plate was coming, they quickly apologized and said it was coming up. I then looked at my receipt and realized they did not bill me for it. When I told them it wasn't paid for and not to bother because I had more than enough to share with my boyfriend and parents, they insisted on making my gyro plate at no cost. Of course I gave them a hefty tip - what I would have paid for the gyro plate. They deserved it! And that's not all. They ran out of rice for my platter and in consolation, gave us a hummus appetizer on the house! Needless to say, our entire experience was excellent. They were so generous and attentive - gave us so much more than what we asked for and expected in terms of side sauces, additional pita bread, and drinks. And most importantly, one of THE BEST Greek food joints in Phoenix. Hands down. I definitely will be a regular here. THANK YOU YELP and YELPERS for this successful find!
263	1	a	"One, two, three strikes, you're out!\n\nLet's just talk about last night's dinner:  I really wanted to love this place but it just wasn't working out.  Maybe it was the ripe sewer smell as soon as you walk in [Johnny Rockets at Westgate also has this issue] or maybe it was the lack of hot tea on a super cold December evening... I like to attribute it to the fact that they overuse the \""orange sauce\""  and unagi sauce on EVERYTHING.  \n\nIt wasn't just a few artsy swirls of the \""orange sauce\"" and unagi sauce.  They absolutely drench it.  You can dive in with scuba gear!  Maybe I didn't notice that I wasn't ordering a wide array of items but I swear almost everything I saw on the menu had the same sauce combo.  Eating the Firecracker Jalape\u00f1os, The Mexican Roll, and The Kamikaze Roll felt and tasted the same to me.  The only real difference between the two rolls was that The Mexican had peppers on top with cooked salmon [yes, cooked] and imitation crab while The Kamikaze had avocado on top with spicy tuna and tempura shrimp inside.  Other than that, it felt like we had three of the same dishes since the sauce was so overwhelming.  Thinking back to it is seriously making me feel a little queasy.\n\nThe tacos here are pretty decent and we ended up ordering edamame on the side to help switch up the taste after eating so much orange and unagi sauce.  Like I said, maybe they do have more variety and we didn't see any but I don't think I'll be back to test this theory.  Portions are pretty generous and you can at least ask for easy sauce but it's your poison if you choose to dine here.  Too many great places to eat to just settle for sauce-drenched-everything.  Service here could also be a little better considering when we went, we were just one of three tables.\n\n$27 each [for 2 ppl] including tip for edamame, firecracker jalape\u00f1os, two rolls, three tacos, and an iced tea."
264	2	a	This was a great service.  They were able to come out same day and they even offer organic products.  Thank you.
265	1	a	MY RATING HAS TO DO WITH THE SERVICE NOT THE FOOD. THE FOOD WOULD GET 5 STARS EASILY!\n\nStarting off positive, the food was excellent! I ordered the Roasted Chili Glaze wings and they were, BY FAR, the best I have ever had! The other guests in my party ordered the Hot, Honey, and Hoppy wings, and the Southwest Americana burger. I tried both of those, and they were delicious. The wings had a nice kick to them without being overwhelming and the burger was the same way. The goat cheese balanced out the gigantic, fried pepper perfectly. QUALITY ingredients and well sized portions. For the food only, I will be visiting again.\n\nNow for the reason I gave a 2-star rating. It was a busy afternoon because of the ASU vs U of A game, so I figured service might take a little longer than normal. However, the amount of time we waited and the lack of attention our waiter gave to us was not what it should have been even with it being busy.\n\nWe started off ordering beers and that came out to us at a reasonable time. Then our waiter, Scott, took our order. We put in for the wings, burgers, and an appetizer (chips and salsa) to start us off. After 10-12 minutes of waiting I started to look for Scott walking around the restaurant to grab his attention and ask for our chips, but he was no where to be found. And the few times I caught a glimpse of him walking around, he never visited our table. Our meal took about 18 minutes or so to come out, which was fine wit me, but he never gave us our appetizer or even acknowledged that he forgot it. \n\nAbout 10 minutes into dinner, one of my guest's wanted a refill for the beer but again, our waiter was no where around. When he finally came to our table about 3 minutes later, another one of my guest's asked for a water (that he forgot to bring from the beginning) and before the guest who wanted a beer could even ask, Scott walked away too fast to even get a word out. By that time, we just had our mind on getting the check. \n\nIt took another 10 minutes to get the check processed because Scott hadn't come back to get our check, so we gave it to another waitress to get it done. Overall, we felt like we were the guests shoved into the corner and forgotten about. In my opinion, there were not enough staff working for how many people were there. That could have attributed to the lack of service and minimal attention needed to serve our table.
266	2	a	Excellent food, great staff. Been here 3 times and love it. Fantastic atmosphere. Vegetarian options for the girl! Will be back many times!
267	1	a	Thursday Sep 25th:\nIt is a beautiful fall day today and I'm off work and decided to give Ma'tine a second chance.  \n\nThe person who answered the phone told me that he did not like my last review so I was NOT welcome...\n\nThat was a pretty good and constructive review actually: so I called back and had to fight my way back.  I was allowed in the place on the patio and with my dog and the food  was great so as staff. Spent 50$ for food and a couple of glass wine including gratuities.\n\nFriday Sept 26th:\nStill another beautiful day worked all morning and called to make a reservation on the patio, was looking for again great time.  That DID NOT happen even after 2pm.\n\nSo as I arrived at the restaurant AND I was told that  they had complaints about my dog on the patio the day before, even if he was is sleeping under the picnic table. And was  not allowed to the empty patio and turned at the door by Sophie, she did suggest that I tied him outside the patio...\n\nThis place is profiling clients.  I will not write more as it is NOT worth it.\n\nQuality of food is not all in the restaurant business, Atmosphere, service, cutlery and china, location, toilets are ALL factors.  ALL you have the quality of food, you have lots of competition around.\n\nI have took lots of pictures, I will upload later once I find out how to do it...\n\nBest of luck
268	2	a	What a fantastic new restaurant!! This area really needs a place like this! I was with my family walking down Glendale Ave when we ran into the owner, Tom. He came up and started talking to us about his new place down the street. He was so friendly so we instantly had to check this new place out. What an excellent decision it was! Immediately upon entering I saw the copper mugs and knew they served moscow mules. Tom told us about their house made fig infused vodka for the moscow mules and we quickly ordered 3. Extremely well crafted and absoloutely delicious!! I could have easily down 3 of those! Since we were heading to Haus Murphy's after our cocktails for dinner, we only ordered an appetizer. We ordered the meat/cheese/olive plate and wow oh wow!!! It was only $10 and well worth it. 3 of us split it and it was a perfect snack with our moscow mules! The staff was incredibly friendly and talkative as well. Tom gave us a tour of the restaurant as well. He showed us the original brick wall towards the back, which was a very nostalgic touch to leave in the place. The patio wasn't quite finished, but it will be awesome once done! Love the beautiful iron gate! Hopefully this new place gets the recognition it deserves and more people come to check this out! Glendale definitely needs a cool place like this! Tom made us feel so welcome and privileged too to be a part of this new establishment!!
269	2	a	Good experience.\nEntrance to restaurant was confusing but was beautiful. \nEven though they make their own beers, offer wine but NO liquor :( Tea was ok.\nPretzel w/beer cheese like other places.\nBurger was great! Tasty & juicy!\nSalmon pita was great too!\nWait staff helpful and always checking on us.
270	2	a	We have eaten here twice--both times the food and service was excellent.  The first time, Jason, was also training a new person.  He, and she, were professional and efficient.  My husband had a question about how the prime rib was cooked--He like his well-done.  Jason went into the kitchen and the chef/owner came out with a piece of it to that Ken could try it before ordering--good customer service.  I had the crab benedict and the crab cake was as good as Ruby Tuesday's.  The second time I had the Reuben--the best one I have had.  My husband had the ham steak and eggs over easy.  Perfection.  \n\nIt's hard to believe that the 3 previous reviews and I had frequented the same place.
271	2	a	Great food . The wait was a little longer then I expected but other then that everything was good
272	1	a	I have to say I love cafe rio! Their food is simple yet delicious, the service is great as well as consistent, and my appetite and tummy are always satisfied. However I've been to this location 3 different times and have not experienced any of these.. Even though it may be convenient for many of us here in henderson, please listen to the other reviews and DO NOT EAT AT THIS LOCATION ! New management is highly needed
273	2	a	Wow! Customer service lives. Manager even came by to check in on us after our wait was a little longer than expected. Great servers, ambience and food - original and savory. From the customer service to the quality of the food, I recommend you to check it out!
274	2	a	Interesting addition to East Blvd!  Hopefully it helps bring back some life to the area. The atmosphere is great, super casual but packed and lively. Everyone is here to have a good time. \n\nThe bar tables are ridiculous. The concrete top is only inches larger than the barrel base, so you cannot sit under the table at all. You have to sit sideways at the table.  If I had waited an hour and a half to get that table, I would be pissed.  Fortunately, we were sat at a hightop near the bar with regular seats.  Other than the grotesquely under-estimated wait time, the service was really good.\n\nThe tacos were interesting, but out of the four we tried I'm not sure I would eat any of them again. For me the food to go back for is the baked cheese dip and the tostadas.\n\nThe cheese dip is not your standard Mexican fare.  It has an awesomely bruleed top but eat quickly or it will get stringy and hard and cold.\n\nThe potato tostada was fantastic! Served in a cold iron skillet, with a bottom layer of dressed romaine salad, it has two layers of fresh made crispy tostada shells. Separated by beans and crispy potato cubes, it has a great balance of flavor and texture. The green sauce on the table adds a lot to it.  \n\nDefinitely a good addition to the restaurant/bar scene.
275	2	a	Awesome, tasty Banh mi sandwiches, real deal Pho soups in a well decorated dining area. This is the prettiest pho place I have ever eaten where the taste of good food matches the decor! So worth it if you want wonderful Vietnamese food!
276	2	a	A true bakery! It's just not in my budget. \n\nEverything here looks great. And the decor is neat and nice. I bet if they had some music playing customers would be inclined to linger at the lobby counter space with their treats. The window lighting is terrific. The buttermilk scone was sooo good! I just love a scone with coffee in the morning. The vanilla Twinkie and its surprise berry filling is my absolute favorite. And dipped in chocolate too... Yum yum!  \n\nBut the prices were too high for me. I was looking for a quick treat after lunch and the goodies were too high in the $4-$7 range. I realize quality comes at a cost. Maybe if smaller cookie/bar treats were offered at a smaller price point I would come back more often. I'll have to build up some cash for the $7 small pies. Looks delish!
277	1	a	Beware, I was shocked to find out they charge a delivery fee for each item. I ordered 3 sandwiches and was charged $4.09 delivery. That's $1.36 ea. Ridiculous, almost the cost of a sandwich.
278	1	a	Extremely annoying! I called to see what time they where open till that day and they said midnight. (Even thow yelp said 2am but I called to make sure). My friend and I took a cab there exited to go because we've never been but have heard about it. We arrived at 11:20pm and they said they where closed....are you fucking kidding me? After I SPECIFICALLY called to make sure this wouldn't happen. They didn't seem to care that I was lied to and my trip over was a total waste of my time and money. Boooooo! To bad I didn't get the chance to try the food to rate otherwise :(
279	1	a	Visited today for lunch... there were 7 of us.  The food was just okay.  I had a truffle burger and we all shared side items including French Fries (shoestring fries that are HORRIBLE and cold), a house pickle plate that includes a variety of pickled items (carrots, mushrooms, beets, etc., also YUCK), and were supposed to share a plate of fried pickles which were forgotten and never brought to the table.  Aside from the crappy food, soda is served by the bottle (so be prepared to shell out $3 for each 12 oz bottle you drink).... and the real clincher: on top of the 20% gratuity they automatically added to the bill, they added AN EXTRA 20% SERVICE CHARGE simply for being a party of 6 or more.  Nope, sorry... never again!  Good luck surviving in SLS where the hotel smell alone made me want to vomit!
280	1	a	"Griddle Cafe is \""meh\"", to put it simply. I got a scramble that had jalape\u00f1os, onions, avocado, egg whites and chorizo. It sounded amazing, flavor wise it was not that great. There was also a layer of all the juices that I'm assuming came from the meat and egg whites that just sat on the bottom of my plate like they didn't even try to keep that unwanted stuff in the pan. The red velvet pancake on the other hand was pretty good, I couldn't complain. But really, take a trip to Peppermill down the street. Might cost you just as much if not less and it's better than average. Or take a taxi cab to Hash House on the strip or go to Baby Stacks for really good pancakes. There are so many better breakfast options in this city. The service was good, nothing exceptional. Overall, meh."
281	2	a	1st of all we chose to stay at Hilton Grand Vacations for a night before staying at Bellagio for the week. The choices at Hilton GV were sparse so they recommended Griddle Cafe at SLS. What a fabulous recommendation!\nThe cafe is located inside SLS, which is a very short walk from monorail stop. The place is usually busy, but wait times are usually less than 5min. \n\nWe were seated right away. The service was quick in getting our orders and drinks to us, despite the large parties around  us. The ambience was casual and relaxed. There is a bar area for the single diners or people that want to sit near the kitchen area.\n\nThe food: we ordered Senior Juan's Steak tacos, 2 Eggs over medium with potatoes, multigrain toast, and the Fiesta Scramble with chile-cheese bread. We didn't order pancakes - should of, they were the size of pizzas!! Everyone around us had them and they looked delicious! They are supposedly known for them.\nThe prices are phenomenal for Vegas!\nSe\u00f1or Juan's Tacos - 13.95\n2 eggs any style, with fruit, griddle potatoes and toast - 9.95\nFiesta Scramble - 13.95\n\nThe portions are incredibly large as we didn't been come close to finishing. The waitress told us we should share the scramble next time! All in all a good choice if your in the area or have monorail access.
282	2	a	The Griddle has a HUGE menu, so be prepared for that when you arrive.  My friends and I dined on a Sunday evening and had no problem walking up to get a table.  There's not a TON of variety anywhere on the menu except the pancakes.  The dining room is comfortable and really cuts off the casino floor noise, despite being directly next to it.  My friends and I ordered a mix of breakfast (omelette) and lunch/dinner (fish tacos and shrimp pesto sandwich) items and were definitely satisfied.  The only thing I would have enjoyed is more flavor in the omelette and accompanying breakfast potatoes.  Our server seemed a bit off her game, but we all have off days, so we wrote that off.  If you're looking for a unique dining experience in a Strip casino, check out The Griddle.  I'm sure you won't be disappointed!
283	1	a	The food is good but the service is terrible. We were four people and they brought our orders one by one.. We went there for the breakfast and asked them to have wheat bread, we almost finished our food and they finally served us bread at the last moment.by the way it's too expensive for this kind of food and service.
284	1	a	"Delicious food, terrible service & meh atmosphere.... I was invited to brunch here with a friend who had heard great things about the food. It's a Monday morning, casino is not packed but there's a little wait, which wasn't bad. \n\nFirst thing I noticed when we sat down was HOW LOUD IT WAS. The walls and floors are concrete and brick, so acoustically, the music echoed everywhere and we had to talk at a much more elevated level than normal... Every time the kitchen filled the utensils it added to the noise with so much banging. I can't imagine eating there while hungover, it would be like hell. \n\nOur waitress was super slow and didn't do any of the basic things you'd expect from a breakfast place- she never brought us cream for our coffee, when we finally asked it took over 10 minutes. When my friend asked to have the whipped cream for her pancakes on the side, we practically had to spell it out, like she had never had anyone ask this before. She failed to bring any butter to the table after the pancakes were served, it was an hour after we ordered that we were able to finally flag someone down for it. She didn't even bother to mention that the syrup was already on the table, tucked away in the corner next to the wall and looked at us crazy when we asked for some even though we told her at the beginning that it was our first time there.  At the end of our 2 HOUR breakfast (seriously....) I asked for 2 to-go containers, of course she brought only one. My friend asked for a separate container to put some whipped cream in, again, blank stare. I finally got pissed and said, \""can you just bring a separate container for the whipped cream?!?\"" What did she bring us? A container full of brand new whipped cream! (We just wanted the stupid styrofoam bowl!) \n\nWe were giving the server the benefit of the doubt because it was so hard to hear clearly in there, but after all that, she's just a flat out bad server. Even with the food being so delicious, I highly doubt I'll go back for a long time. I have better things to do with places much closer, better ambiance, and better service with comparable food."
285	2	a	People & service were great. The pastries were delicious. The coffee was too bitter for my taste otherwise I liked this place alot. I highly recommend it!
286	2	a	After a drunken stopper at some pool party.  Came back for a quick bite.  decided on the steak sandwich and a chocolate chip cookie.  Both exceptional, cookie was soft and moist and super chocolatey.  More cafe-ish.\nService was ultra friendly and helpful.
287	1	a	Para ser arroz y frijoles,  esta muy caro. No es mi gusto en comida. Pueda que a otros les guste, en lo personal a mi no!!!
288	1	a	Decor is quaint.  We had a bad experience here though .  As we where being seated, we passed 5 open booths.  hostess sat us down at a wobbly table, so we asked to move to a booth.  she pointed at a row of 4 occupied booths, told us to sit here and wait for one of them to open up.  Waitress showed up twice.  once to take order, and once to give check.   food delivered by other staff.  as for the food.\n\nTasteless for the Asian / middle eastern pallet.  no rich flavors\n\nTea -  from a tea bag.  \nbottled water -  smaller than usual bottles.  can fill up 3 guest glasses\nchicken tangine - served skin on, very tender but no taste.\nlamb shwarma -  street vendors in london do better job  \n\nroast lamb.  get 5 pieces of tenderloin sliced -  no taste, very gamey taste that comes  from it being of a certain quality.  high quality lamb does not have that much game taste\n\noverall, not going back.  better middle east options in town for fraction of cost.
289	1	a	The only reason I give this place two stars is because they almost killed me. In my reservation on OpenTable and when I entered the restaurant and when we talk to the waitress we told her multiple times about our food allergies. But somehow she failed to connect that with the chefs.  Two of the dishes we received had our allergies and  one was actually eaten. We had to write an incident report with the SLS and the manager had to handle the situation because the waitress was unable to. She couldn't even list the ingredients that were in many of the food that we ordered.  The busboys knew more then her. \n\nOn the slightly positive note about the restaurant some of the dishes we ate were very good. The shwarma  was excellent and so were the kebabs. We did not receive most of our dishes because after almost eating a pinenut  that would've killed me I wasn't really that hungry.\n\nThe management and busboys were excellent in handling the situation. The waitress was an epic fail. I would go back and try the restaurant again but I would make sure that my waitress truly understands what might kill me in my food.
290	2	a	Great unexpected find. Came to SLS to try another restaurant but it was closed. Walked into Cleo on a gamble. Sat at the bar. Great bartending staff. Try the Old Hollywood cocktail if you like bourbon. Each of the small plates were great. You can easily go into a food coma here. The Shawarma was exceptional. I'll be back. Check it out!
291	1	a	We had breakfast at this place because we were gambling at the Old Downtown. The server was kind of too honest . One of my friend asked for a carrot juice and our server said it was nasty ! Food was ok, nothing special. The hammer came when we got the bill, it was $72 , my friend put $20 cash, another friend $25 on his credit card and another friend $12 on his credit card, we told the waiter to put the rest on my card. when I opened the bill, it was $56 !?!?!?!?!? How is that possible. So we told him, he is trying to explain us how we were wrong and he was right . After a few minutes,he realized it didn't add up. He said I'm not good at Maths!!! Hello you using a fancy cash register !!! Please stay away from this dinner !
292	1	a	Packed up the kids and headed down to try a new pizzeria. Called in the afternoon they said they would be open until 10 PM. Pulled up at 7 PM and they said sorry we are closed.
293	2	a	Oh my!  Went here today with my husband and we ABSOLUTELY loved it. \n\nWe got a pizza and a salad. If you haven't tried it and don't know the concept here it is: you choose a pizza, salad, or pasta and load it up with any toppings you want for one price. And when I say any toppings I mean any toppings. We got meatball, pepperoni, bacon, ham, onions, jalape\u00f1os and olives on our pizza. They had a ton of fresh toppings for the salad... asparagus, roasted red peppers, cilantro, chicken, romaine, mushrooms, apples. I could seriously go on and on. The dressing we got on the salad was a balsamic vinaigrette which was so yummy. Dare I say one of the most delicious o have had in some time? \n\nI was worried the pizza would take too long to make but they use a thin crust that they pop into a wood burning type oven and in three minutes, BAM! Your pizza is ready. \n\nStaff was friendly and knowledgeable. The price was very reasonable, especially considering that there is no limit to what you can pile on. $7.75 for a pizza, salad, or pasta. \n\nWe are thinking about making this our weekly pizza place. Its cheaper than our usual pizza joint and healthier. GIVE THIS PLACE A SHOT!
294	1	a	I found a bug in the raspberry in the Mochi ice cream. The waitress was very impatient, every time we needed to order something she would run off to get it but wasn't finish ordering.  She talked too fast that was hard to understand her.  The furniture was cheap and not comfortable.  other food was okay. The manager took some items off the bill though.
295	1	a	This club could have some potential but it's always empty. I've been here 4x since grand opening a few weeks ago and it's slower and slower every time.  Staff is polite once inside. It literally takes 20-25 minutes in heavy weekend traffic to get from Bellagio to the SLS. They might as well be on their own island.
296	1	a	I love their DJ line up, but I hate how this club was designed. If anyone has been to Light nightclub at the Mandalay Bay, this club looks a lot like it but smaller. Their fog machine goes off way too many times and it's freezing for girls too!! I feel like they leave it on for 15 secs long. TOO MUCH!
297	2	a	Love the veggie sandwiches and the dutch crunch bread. A bit overpriced but the sandwiches are huge. They did miss a couple of ingredients on my sandwich a couple of times, like the habanero salsa. I just hope the place survives unlike all the previous establishments in this location.
298	2	a	Kiko styled my hair for a photo shoot and my wedding! He is amazing and I wouldn't trust anyone else but him with my hair for a special day. I have also had him trim my hair. He is the sweetest person, professional and filled with talent! Love love love his style!
299	2	a	"kiko is an amazing artist. My hair was long and in need of an \""attitude adjustment\"". I gave a vague direction for my new style and Kiko brought it full circle. When I looked in the mirror for the first time after Kiko completed the cut, I was amazed! He created a master piece!! Thank you Kiko for being such a talented hair designer! I love my new do!"
300	2	a	"My family is from New York City and we were DYING for some rice. (We asians love our rice) We were driving around Chinatown and just over looking some of the menus and the Chinatown Plaza caught our eye, so we parked our car and checked out some of the restaurants. \nNothing on the ground floor interested us so we went up and saw Spicy City. It was pretty empty inside, only about 2 tables filled but the owner of the restaurant, a very friendly and jolly man, popped his head out and says \""please! come try out the food! it's amazing, my wife cooks it!\"" \n\nThis man did not lie. We had 4 dishes to share with a big pot of rice and soup. Everything was delicious, and this family owned business really hit the spot for my rice craving family. However, the food is very well seasoned with pepper so anyone who isn't very good at eating spicy foods, tell them to slow it down on the pepper cause this restaurants lives up to its name. \n\nI recommend asking the owner or his son for recommendations on the best foods for the night!"
301	1	a	so bad. worst service ive ever had. wont try this ever! the pork dumpling is not bad though
302	1	a	"Let me first say how excited I was that a taco shop of any variety was opening near my house and place of work.  Staring outside my work window watching them refurbish this location for the past 6 months got me excited for something new.  I have been 4 times and have told myself never again. This last time (9-7-2014), I really mean it. \n\nOrdering is a weird thing. Since each item has to be placed into the computer, individually the process takes forever. There is no number system when you order. Just one item at a time. This adds up when you have five people in front of you.  They give you a pager after you order. One visit, my pager never went off. The employee walked aimlessly around the restaurant trying to locate the person who ordered it. When she finally found us she asked if we would like for them to make it again because it's cold.  Really?  Why did they ask us knowing its cold?  We said yes,  25 seconds later our food was back.  It was apparent they just zapped it in the microwave.   \n\nFood.  Food is okay.  Each time I ordered, it came out slightly warm to cold. The \""crispy\"" tacos shells as they call it, is the same exact thing as the hard taco shells you buy from the grocery store and heat in oven-no flavor, dry and stale. The soft tortillas are also store bought/Taco Bell tortillas.  So really the price you pay is not worth it.  They have two flavors of rice; Mexican and cilantro lime rice.  Both tasted like they were microwaved.  The have Latin fried potatoes that also tasted like they were microwaved which are dry and crunchy.  I also decided to get a side of green sauce .75( I think) for a shot glass size cup.  The same size you pump ketchup in at other fast food places.  I felt totally ripped off. \n\nI hope management reads these reviews.  They need to change the tortillas and hard shells at the very least. With better options nearby, I won't be surprised if they are closed within a year.  \n\nOverall, not worth the price and headache for the wait and stale food.  You're better off spending that money at Garcias down the street, tee pees on Indian school and 40th street or a Filiberto's."
303	1	a	I was veeeery excited to try out this restaurant since I had been watching/hearing about the Edgewater's exciting renovations for such a long time, so when a member of my dinner group suggested it, I was delighted. We dined here on 10/11/14.\n\nWe valeted our car.  I wasn't even out of the vehicle before I was greeted by a couple of obnoxious drunk guys spouting off at the mouth.  Badgers won that day-gotsta celebrate I guess.\n\nWhile one of us checked in our party of 12, the rest of us thought we would get a drink at the bar while we waited.  It was a very makeshift bar-the kind you would find at a very makeshift wedding reception with only a handful of different liquors set out on a table with some wine, no tappers, etc. Thankfully they were ready to seat us before we even got to order... so we proceeded to the table.\n\nThe restaurant was comfortable. High ceilings, warm, soft lighting from the well scaled chandeliers hanging above. Obviously the view of the lake was fantastic as the Autumn sun was setting.  Too bad the open kitchen's bright task light kept trying to creep in and ruin my ambiance.  \n\nSo back to my pre-dinner cocktail....I love a good old fashioned and quite frankly, was scared to order one after seeing that ghetto bar, but it's what I really had a taste for, so I thought I would exercise due diligence and ask some specific Qs, such as, if they muddle their drinks, etc. After about 30 long minutes, our drinks arrived. Well, the muddling turned out fine, but there were only about four ice cubes in the entire glass. One of my dining companions, Rich B. (see his recent review on 10/12) was kind enough to order me a glass of ice to make it right. Thanks, Rich B!  \n\nI ordered the beef heart tartare. Edible, but still some of the worst I've ever had and I pretty much order tartare whenever I see it on a menu.  Chef was a bit heavy-handed on the mustard. \n\nI ordered the Filet for my main course-medium rare.  They served it to me somewhere between Medium to medium well. I sent it back and enjoyed the company of my friends while they prepared another for me.  Soon afterward, as my friends were finishing up their meals, the Manager brought me my second steak.  I cut into it to find that it was so rare it was purple.  Mgr said she was hurrying my steak so that I could eat dinner, but I never really ate anything because I obviously sent that one back too. Haste makes waste.   They did ask me if there was ANYTHING on the menu they could get me to right this wrong, but at this point, my friends had finished eating and I had run out of patience, so it's a good thing that bottle of Sauvignon Blanc I ordered went well with my bread and butter dinner. \n\nMy husband had the Seared Diver Scallops with Risotto. He wished there were more than three scallops, but the dish was tasty.  Many of our friends ordered the fish and it was horribly overcooked in every case. \n\nAs a peace offering to one of us in the group when they forgot to bring out their side dish, they offered a different potato type side dish of baby potatoes encrusted (=coated and rolling around in) salt.  //see picture//  This was perhaps the highlight of the evening and gave us all a good chuckle.  It was something you would expect your four year old to whip up and surprise you with on Mother's Day.  What on Earth was going on back there in that kitchen?!?!\n\nNo.  Just no.
304	1	a	The pizza was overall ok.  The crust wasn't done enough and was extremely doughy!!  I enjoyed the flavor of the sauce but my daughter thought it had too much sauce on it.  They delivered very quickly (less than 30 minutes for a large pizza) and the price was very reasonable but I would not order from here again.
305	2	a	New to the area, my husband and I have already hit the highest rated sushi places in Pittsburgh. And while many were good, this BY FAR is the very BEST we have had!\n\nNewly opened, the restaurant is a good space. The front room looks small, but there's another dining area in the back. It was quiet when we came--a Monday night before the dinner rush. We were seated, given water and menus, and had our order taken fairly quickly. Miso soup came out right away.\n\nWe ordered the spicy tuna roll, the yellow tail roll and the hibachi chicken entree. Both rolls came out together and let me say: the fish is incredibly fresh! The sushi was absolutely delicious. We were so happy with it, we wanted to order more rolls just to take home with us. Luckily we didn't, because we ate the entire hibachi chicken entree. Cleaned the plate, it was so good. The staff was friendly, and the owner came around and asked us, and all the other diners, how our dinner was.\n\nAt the end of the meal, the owner brought us our check and gave us each a Hello Kitty chocolate marshmallow. It might sound odd to mention it, but to us, it was a sign that the owner really cared about his customers. He wanted to make a lasting good impression. Well, he did. We plan on returning frequently.
306	1	a	Great idea, poor execution - from customer service to ambience. \n\nI was really looking forward to visiting this place and was greatly disappointed. One employee was dealing with taking orders and processing payments, handling food, giving an interview, arguing with a vendor who was late with deliveries, and opening the door to let customers in.\n\nEnded up waiting 15 minutes to get into the cafe and another 25 minutes to get a coffee (had to order another croissant as the first was eaten while waiting for the coffee). \n\nAs someone already mentioned here, there is no cafe ambiance - just a room filled with some ikea like furniture and cats. Although adorable, the cats are not sufficient to make up for the rest.
307	2	a	I have tried chocolate martinis all over Vegas. My faves have been at the Wynn and the iBar at the Rio until I discovered the Chocolate Bar at New York, NY. I had Death By Chocolate and the Reeses Martinis. Not only are they tasty and strong but they also cost less. Only $12 each as opposed to $16 at the Wynn and $14 at the iBar. My only gripe would be that the bartender does not fill them up as much as the other places, but if you ask nicely when ordering, she will take care of you. I was told that it just opened last August. Can't wait to go back!
308	2	a	Good place to go if you like ramen offered in places like NYC. The broth is good but the noodles could be better. I would highly recommend the bacon wrapped enoki (mushroom) as an appetizer. I'm glad to see a place like this open up in Charlotte.
309	1	a	Kind of disappointed. The concept is great to make healthy meals intended for a person going to the gym. I felt like it was overly staffed with girls who just stood around and talked to each other. I ordered a lean ground turkey burrito. \n\nIt was cold. Felt like the meat was something I could have got frozen at Costco. Taste was bland. \n\nI was excited to go my first time. Just wasn't overly fond of the lack in taste of food and girls who were there pointlessly. They were prolly intended to be eye candy but didn't work out at all. \n\nDoesn't help the cooks were out of shape either.\n\nI don't real judge too much. It's rare I feel this strong. But feel like it's a great concept but have some improvements it could use.
310	2	a	We were excited to have a new restaurant open in our neighborhood. Outstanding selection of craft beers, great bar, awesome selection of Scotches and Whiskeys. The food is amazing. I had the Atomic Sausage sandwich made with Pelicaric family sausage and house hot pepper mustard. Loved it! My wife had the patty melt, made special by their roasted garlic spread. My son had the spicy citrus chicken sandwich, another great surprise. All three dishes had welcome twists on otherwise traditional sandwiches.  I had a triple Belgian and my wife had a sour ale, both were wonderful. The service was outstanding, thanks to Jameson who was tending bar. We will definitely be back and encourage neighbors and visitors to try them out!
311	1	a	"My boyfriend and I went Monday evening for dinner.  The decor is nice and the seating is comfortable.  A hostess seated us immediately.  The server, however, seemed scatterbrained.  Although menus were delivered, she did not pour us water or offer to take our drink orders before coming by to take our food order.  Her question to us:  \""Oh, did I not get your drinks?  Did you want any?\""\n\nNo.  Thanks.\n\nWe shared an order of Poutine which was serviceable but nothing stellar.  The Poutine is covered with onion gravy which presumably is used with the bangers & mash.  Poutine traditionally uses a rich brown gravy, which this was not.\n\nI ordered the kale salad with cranberries, walnuts, parmesan, etc.  BF ordered the fish with slaw.  The fish was in shapes that were too perfect to be fresh.  I immediately thought that the fish must come off the back of a food truck.  We agreed the slaw was nasty.  Neither of us could identify what the seasoning was, but it was pretty awful.\n\nThe kale salad, although large and the kale a beautiful green, was undressed.  Thankfully the ingredients were tasty enough that it really did not need dressing, and without having been coated in dressing the leftovers were fresh the next day.\n\nWe didn't try any beer but the beer list was impressive.  I cannot comment on the serving temperature, glassware, etc., to tell you if they serve it well.\n\nWith so many new restaurants opening all the time in the Madison area, I doubt we will return to the Flying Hound for another meal."
312	2	a	Friendly staff. Unique concept. Absolutely exhilarating fun! Loved the ability to use critical thinking and problem solving to play this real life puzzle.
313	2	a	"Items Selected:\nHousemade chips and salsa\nSangria Trio - Blushing Senorita:  Watermelon, Lime, Mint, Rose / Roja: Red Apples, Orange Wedges, Strawberries, Red Wine / Blanco: Orange, Green Apples, Bay Leaf, Chardonnay\nQuesillo Fondue Mexicano - Mexican Cheeses, Hormiga Sauce, Roasted Cherry Tomatoes, Flour Tortillas\nSpicy Calamari a la brasa - Squid Ink, Citrus Jalapeno charbroiled calamari\nParrilladas Del Patron- Grilled Filet Mignon, Rib Eye, Costillitas, Mexican Cream Corn, Portabellos, Papas Criollas with Ancho Chile Steak Sauce, Chimichurri Sauce, Hormiga Sauce\nTamal de Pollo - braised and seasoned shredded chicken, roasted garlic creamy tomatillo sauce\nMole Semana Santa - Roasted Chicken in traditional Mexican spicy Chocolate Sauce\nBread Pudding - dulce de leche\n\nRe-inventing Las Vegas' former 'oldest restaurant' into an upscale \""bistro\"" helmed by Chef Oscar Sanchez it was with high hopes of Latin cuisine rivaling that found in New Mexico or Arizona that plans were made to dine at El Sombrero and although a rude welcome by the woman who turned out to be the restaurant's owner put an early damper on the experience the food, service, and setting that followed were nothing short of first-rate.  Joined by two others, one well known to the restaurant, for a lunch beginning just shy of noon it was amidst the cozy modernized confines of a room suited for less than fifty that the meal commenced and with free-flowing tortillas hot and crisp from the kitchen flanked by aromatic salsa not overburdened by heat a strong attention to detail was obvious from the start.\n\nGenerally underwhelmed by Sangria, but told that El Sombrero's was far better than the average grog, a 'one of each' sampling immediately proved the point as bright balance and bold aromatics nuanced each of the infusions and with a duo of strong starters soon to arrive the dominant fruit tones were a welcomed refresher between bites - the creamy Quesillo offering subtle hints of smoke when matched to the Roja while tender ringlets of squid bathed in a murky broth teaming with citrus and spice proved every bit the 'signature' starter that many have claimed - a similar paella presentation apparently offered for special events immediately piquing interest for a future visit with several other options offered for groups as large as sixteen.\n\nTransitioning next to a platter of meats traditionally offered only at dinner suffice it to say that the Parrilladas Del Patron is more than enough to feed two assuming starters are ordered and although the pork short ribs proved a bit too fatty to be fully enjoyed both of the beef options were impressively tender and spiced only enough to let the quality of the meet shine - a similar compliment offered to tender mushrooms while sides of crispy potatoes, tender beans, and pan-scalded corn in light cream were no less than superb.\n\nCertainly a bigger fan of tamales than either of my dining buddies, albeit a bit let down that the restaurant was currently out of brisket, there is no doubt in my mind that Oscar's Tamal de Pollo is the least heavy-handed I've tasted to date and with garlic tinged tomatillo sauce melding nicely to the sweet corn it was the roasted chicken that truly made the plate shine, a statement almost equally well suited to the tender-roast bird beneath the sort of mole uncommonly seen at all but the most authentic of spots, a 'dirty' dark sauce teaming with spice with only the slightest cocoa linger as opposed to the sugar-sweet chocolate syrup popularized by more Americanized spots.\n\nFinishing the afternoon with the restaurant's only daily dessert, a pleasant bread pudding with silky-soft texture doused in dulce de leche, it was once again here that Chef Sanchez arrived tableside to make sure all was well and with compliments and thanks paid to the chef and servers any lamenting the closure of the original El Sombrero should find consolation in the fact that sometimes the right team really can teach an old dog some new tricks."
314	1	a	"Vegetarian, don't get a \""vegetarian filling\"" burrito, its filled with only beans and rice then lettuce on side. The  menu says guacomole but youll get charged $2 extra for it. Get salad instead!! Les s room for error and more bang for your bucks."
315	1	a	I m writing this review for the gilbert rd/ baseline location but it seems the complaints are similar from location to location\nTheir food is good but god help you if you go there when its busy like we did on friday night 10/16/14\nYou don't get a single second to decide what you want before they sling it in your aluminum dish. Then they slide 4-5 of the same looking burrito under the cooker with no ID to the customer. GUESS WHAT?? You get the wrong burrito and they throw your food around like its a jailhouse mess hall. I watched a female employee throw a cup of guac at the cashier who did not catch it.\nIts cafeteria style and when its busy.....its a freaking zoo\n\nSo.... You get the wrong burrito and pay more at the register.  Watch out for extra anything because you'll pay for it.\nEven though we had a free burrito coupon....it was a nuthouse and the employees are slinging so fast that you simply dont have time to decide anything.\nSo you get what you get and with 30 people single file in a long line...who's gonna listen to you??\n\nHey Cafe Rio- time to rethink your assembly line process and instead of upchargng for grilled steak and chicken, just have them be priced as separate burritos on your menu. Grilled meat is a mexican standard??? No???\n\nRight now....Chipolte is my go to burrito for price and service...sorry cafe rio.
316	2	a	"Came here during a visit to see Uncle Ryan.  My son loved it (3 years old).  We were running out of things to do for him so it was a good find.  This place is great for a couple hours if you have a toddler or young child you want to entertain & tire out.  They also do bday parties, it would probably be good for a small group of kids in that age group.\n\nPros:\nClean\nprice: $8\nindoors so option for any weather/year round\n\nCons:\nIt's relatively small :  there are 4-5 large \""bouncy houses\"" and a toddler room"
317	2	a	Swanky yet comfortable bar adjacent to the lobby of the Delano (formerly Mandalay's THE Hotel) on the south strip. Nice environ with knowledgeable bartenders serving craft beers and mixologist cocktails. It's tucked away, allowing patrons to mingle in the shadows while enjoying a nice drink or two. Not a destination in itself, but a good place to catch a drink or two while waiting for the real Vegas festivities to commence. Also note: Franklin. . .at the Delano. . .like the former President Roosevelt.
318	1	a	"I hate to have to write a bad review but I hope that maybe the owner will read and take suggestions before this restaurant closes like the others have in this location.         \nWe went in at 630 on a Saturday and the place was pretty empty. The menu and the signage outside both mentioned \""happy hour\"". I guess we weren't in the right area because we asked if we could get the happy hour price for an appetizer and were told that was in the bar only, like two tables away. So whatever, no big deal that brought our pepperoni cheese sticks to $8 instead of $5.50. If they would have been better I wouldn't have cared. The pesto and marinara sauces were good but the cheese itself was small so when it was breaded and fried it was quite dried out. I should have thought better and not have ordered the eggplant Parmesan but I wanted to give it a try. It was also too thinly sliced and therefore dried out as well. My daughter got the chicken panini w fries and liked it, my son went w the breakfast burger and liked the egg that was still runny. My daughter asked for ranch for her fries and my son asked for some as well. No big deal. They brought out the customary small plastic cups w ranch. I must say I was unpleasantly surprised to find that we were charged $.79 for each small cup of ranch. I know the two criticisms total $4 but it's more the point of trying to make a great impression on first time customers. Old Spaghetti Factory couldn't make it and that was better so this place needs to turn up the WOW if it wants to make it."
319	2	a	First time, had Lemon Butter Sauce over Angel Hair Pasta. Toppings: red roasted peppers and mushrooms... then made critical mistake of paying $4 extra for 4 shrimp. The shrimp were sooo over cooked they cooked have bounced to the ceiling! (My daughters were the same way) Omit the shrimp and the Pasta and the Sauce were Fabulous!!  Split a Cannoli (first time), it was good. Not huge fan. Service was great however we ate an Early dinner so was not busy yet. She was very friendly. By the end of our dinner it was starting to get busy. Service slacked a little. Waited 15 mins. to come back and take check,  had to flag someone down to come take so we could pay and leave. \nAll in all I would go back, many other tempting items on the menu!
320	1	a	"1 Star is too many.  \n\nHad a Living Social deal for $13 on a $26 min. Made a reservation for Dec 24th at 7:30pm. I called day before to check hours and reservation times. Lady said, \""We'll be open as late as we have people in the restaurant, and the kitchen will be open until AT LEAST 9pm. We're taking reservations for 7 & 7:30, would you like to make one?\""  I told her I'd check with my wife.  I did and we made one through Yelp for the 7:30 slot she said was open, so they KNEW they had one coming at 7:30.  Yelp even sent me a reminder that day.  (We use Open Table ALL the time and have NEVER had an issue with their system.\n\nWe get there at 7:30.  There were several groups still there, eating and drinking.  But, we were told, \""We closed at 7\""...\""Nobody would have taken that reservation\"", and \""You must have made the reservation for a California location.\""  This lady had such a nasty attitude, we were flabbergasted.  When I told her I made it on Yelp and showed her, she didn't care just said they closed at 7 and that was that.\n\nWe turned around and walked out.  It took us half an hour to find a decent place to eat on Christmas Eve, after we just spent 12 hours in our own store with our customers, who we would NEVER talk to or treat this way.\n\nBottom line, this lady and Sauce ruined was to be the cap on a long holiday season for us.\n\nWe will never come back, and given how many restaurants have come and gone in this location, can't wait to see what's next if this lady and her crew continue to treat people this way.\n\nWait....is that the Karma truck I see circling?\n\nBy the way, while Yelp refused to do anything to intervene, Open Table would have jumped in, contacted the restaurant and done something to help make it right.  So Yelp, if you want to compete on the Reservation side, take some lessons from Open Table and step up when you have a reservation issue, and not just, \""...the restaurant is responsible for maintaining their own schedule and there is no way for us to know when a restaurant is, or is not, open without their input.\"""
321	2	a	Locked myself out of my car and stress out fairly quick.These guys came highly recommended by a friend of mine who ran into this problems a few weeks back.Its no surprise why these guys are recommended.Very fast and reliable, they know their job and know how to do it.10 stars if I could.
322	2	a	Thanks to Asian Sweet Bakery, I no longer need Chicago to get my fix of coconut rolls, BBQ pork bun, custard tarts, or red bean sesame balls. Dare I say it, do I even need donuts anymore? Moreover, their breakfast special and value pricing make me feel good about coming back often. \n\nI basically ordered everything I wanted to try during my first trip here, things I've been missing and craving, like steamed rice crepe with shrimp, rice porridge with fish and preserved egg. The beef and vermicelli noodle soup was good too, just a tad too much gristle. My hope is that they will expand or refresh the menu as business booms. Space is extremely limited, and it felt crowded by the cash register. We had to hover for a table during the Saturday lunch rush, but it's hard to complain when you see a family-owned business selling the stuff you like, doing well. \n\nService was business-like but pleasant. I was pleased to see a variety of customers from older to younger folks, international students to transplanted locals, blue and white collar workers, with quick turnaround all around. I'm hoping this popularity will translate into a larger space in the future, but it may still be early yet.
323	2	a	What a wonderful professional! He is not only caring and an excellent chiropractor but he is also funny and makes the experience enjoyable. He is thorough in explaining what he is doing and how it's going to help. Not only that but he also supplies ways to keep your back strong. If you need an adjustment I recommend Dr. Teddy!
324	1	a	Ate here last night. Was good. Some growing pains as they just opened up. Mahi tacos were very good. Ate there tonight and was very disappointed.  The short rib hash was not hash.  It was stew. As stew it is pretty good. As hash it sucks!
325	1	a	Like my first drunk sex experience- forgettable! This was public highschool cafeteria-grade ungoodness. \n\nThe only reason they got a second star was that the service was excellent (Cindy, originally from Montibello, CA, was an absolute darling), and they use real maple syrup for the waffles. \n\nEverything else....... prefer to pass. \n\nMeh to the max.
326	2	a	Just came back from here today and loved it.\n\nLocation - Nice. Off Silverado Ranch and Bermuda, a lot of places near it and a good area of town.\n\nAtmosphere - Cute. It was clean, I enjoyed the setup and the dim lighting\n\nFood - Excellent! There were so many options on the menu it was hard to chose, they also had a vegetarian friendly menu. Huge portions, great value, and the food itself was amazing. Food is spicier than most thai places, they warn you, so make sure you don't get anything over a 3 if you only want mild spice.\n\nService - Our server was great. Very friendly, helpful and quick. My boyfriend was clearly struggling with his Pad Thai (which was a level 5 spice) but, we weren't going to ask for a new one or complain, but the server offered to make him a new one. It was a very kind gesture.\n\nWill be back!
327	2	a	Just... wow! So many guns. So much ammunition. So much hunting gear. So much outside gear. Not just camo hats and overalls, but there are workout clothes, running and hiking shoes, boots, and more camping gear than you can possibly shake a stick at.\n\nI took a brief peruse of the shooting equipment and was really impressed. The long guns and pistols were well stocked and reasonably priced. Everything from Kahr to Remington to Smith & Wesson and in between. Tons of accessories including targets, cleaning equipment, gun safes and gun vaults. As for the ammunition - CHEAP. There's been a big run-up in ammo prices lately, but you wouldn't know that from shopping at Gander. Wow.\n\nLove this store. I suspect I'll be buying from here a bit.
328	1	a	the only thing keeping me from raging on the employees right now is the insert of bread they  give you with your sandwich. enjoy over paying for a worse version of jimmy johns. dont come here.
329	1	a	"Flavorless sandwich with inconsistent hours. Called during posted \""business hours\"" and they were not open. Please do not waste my time."
330	2	a	We got take out- the food was good and fresh. The staff are friendly and prices are reasonable.
331	1	a	Another not-so-good review of this recently opened restaurant.  Unfortunately, the service was so slow that we only received one person's order (a salad, but hey, the mustard dressing was pretty good!).  We waited easily over an hour for the barbecue order which never came and no apologies from the wait staff.\n\nAlso, we asked our server-in-training some questions on the food, and she was unable to answer as she's never tried them because she is vegetarian. Honestly, I know it shouldn't matter, but it's hard to trust someone who would never try the food there. Unfortunately, that was the most memorable part.\n\nI may try to come back but it looks like the food that people did get to eat wasn't worth it anyways.  \n\nVerdict: wait and see
332	1	a	Wow what a disappointment for a restaurant in a prime location!  Look forward to the new tenants soon because this place is not going to make it! \n\nCons \n1. Wine prices for the amount of wine you receive - very tiny glasses\n2. Under cooked food (vegetables served not even par cooked basically raw)\n3. Food being served not how it's described on menu (turkey burger should be topped with cheese) \n4. Servers are not customer pleasing (in so many words was told I was either stupid or blind) not very knowledgable on menu \n5. A manager that needs to attend ' restaurant management' formal education. Didn't seem to know how to handle a difficult situation. \n\nPros\n1. Location\n\nOverall a very disappointment experience for our family. \nRed flag any restaurant that's not busy on a Saturday night should make you think twice...   \nLastly, huge failure on our part that we didn't check reviews before we stepped foot inside! Had we read the reviews we would not have wasted our time or $$.
333	1	a	Dropped in for a late lunch... service was good - our server, Sophia, was friendly/attentive. The food was fine - I had the jerk chicken taco which was not bad, but not anything I'd recommend either. My biggest criticism is the ladies room. Honestly, just a mess. Stalls are built of raw wood - in keeping with the restaurant theme, I guess. Exposed nails...door did not lock. No tissue.  Toilet seat loose so that it was sideways across the bowl.  Counter of the sink was wet from splashed water. Paper towel dispenser was broken (I assume) - the roll was sitting between the sinks - half soaked from wicking up the water on the counter...  How managers or staff miss such a fundamental part of their restaurant is beyond me... I'd expect this at a gas station...or college bar... but not here.  Glad we tried it, but doubt we'll be back
334	1	a	"I was out with my friends in South Side the other night, and we were finishing up at Acacia and looking for another place to go. Why not Steel Cactus? After some poor experiences at the Steel Cactus in Shadyside, I thought I'd at least give this place a chance.\n\nWe got in a bit after midnight to meet some friends on the first floor--the bouncer let us know that the first floor is closed and we can only go to the second or third floors. He explained that the bathrooms were out of order and so they weren't letting anyone else on the first floor, even though there was a huge crowd and a busy bar. After some negotiating, he \""allowed\"" us to stay on the first floor with the group we were going to meet.\n\nI struggled to approach the bar and got out some cash to let the bartender know I was thirsty. I waited for about fifteen minutes before giving up. I tried again later and was able to get a weak bourbon and coke. Around 1:40, the music abruptly stopped and a staff member came around to our group to loudly tell us that they were closed and we needed to get out.\n\nNo last call? No thanks for coming? Who closes at 1:40?\n\nI won't be back to try the food; if it's anything like the Shadyside location, I'd be similarly disappointed."
335	2	a	Initially I was worried when I saw the number of menu items offered. Then I understood that this restaurant chose quality over quantity. The food is great, the service perfect and the price seems impossible (appetizer and main dish for 14$ at lunch time). \n\nI am curious to find out if the menu is renewed on a regular basis. I will soon find out since this will be my new spot in the neighbourhood.
336	2	a	This place is awesome! The food is delicious!  The atmosphere is relaxed and inviting. I'm a vegetarian and they have plenty of options for me. I will be back and I am telling all my friends to try this place!
337	2	a	Leah was our waitress and right off the bat I loved the service and restaurant. The vibe is great inside and the lighting is dim after dark so it's an ideal date spot. The food was perfect! I got a mixed vodka drink with coconut water and strawberries and shared deviled eggs, fried catfish, and a number of BBQed meats, last but not least a key lime pie in a cute mason jar. I will definitely be returning... I don't know why anyone would choose Yard House or any other surrounding restaurants over Pot Liquor. Thanks for the great experience!
338	2	a	Excellent food! Four stars only because it is very pricey. We tried the Burnt Ends, Grits & Pork Belly, Potato Salad, Mac & Cheese, Corn Bread, Fries & Alabama White Sauce - all were really good but we will forego the fries for a different side next time just because they were nothing extraordinary.
339	1	a	"I grew up in Birmingham, AL and this was literally the worst BBQ restaurant I have been to in my life (39 years). If you didn't grow up with BBQ, please don't think that what they serve at Pot Liquor is BBQ. Even Famous Dave's is better than this garbage.\n\nThe pulled pork was cooked at too high a temperature for too short a time, so the outside was hard and inedible and the fat and connective tissue didn't break down like it is supposed to, making the interior meat also mostly inedible.\n\nThey serve what they call \""Alabama Sweet Tea\"". To me, it tasted like unsweetened tea. In the south, sweet tea is extremely sweet. I understand toning it down a little bit for those not used to it, but this was extremely bland. I complained and they brought me another glass from a different batch, but it was the same.\n\nTheir sauces have the non-descriptive names of Cue #1 thru Cue #4. I had to ask what they were. I tried all of them and they were terrible. I think #4 was their \""Alabama White Sauce\"". Instead of being a tangy thin white sauce that can penetrate down into the meat, it was basically 98% mayonnaise with a little bit of seasoning. Disgusting.\n\nThey couldn't get basics right, and most of the rest of the menu consists of inappropriate fancy modifications of southern food.\nExamples include:\n\""Fried Catfish Benedict\"": Fried catfish should be able to stand on its own. hollandaise sauce is completely inappropriate.\n\""Devil'd Eggs\"": topped with deep fried chicken skin. The flavor of the skin completely overpowered the egg.\n\""Brownie Bread Pudding\"": bread pudding is already very sweet if made correctly and chocolate is not an appropriate flavor combination. Then they serve it with \""sea salt vanilla gelato\"". If you asked for \""sea salt vanilla gelato\"" in a real BBQ place in the south, they would laugh at you and probably throw you out.\n\""Fried Pies\"": this sounds pretty basic but the description says it is served with \""malted anglaise\"". What the heck?\n\""Strawberry Shortcake Sandwiches\"": sounds pretty straight forward but it comes with strawberry cream gelato. Again with the gelato!\n\""Kansas City Style Burnt Ends\"": Another staple. But they shake \""sugar in the raw\"" over the top. The burnt ends were good but the sugar made the experience unpleasant. Really? You can put sugar on meat that shouldn't have it but you can't put it in your sweet tea?\n\nI told them their chef needs to visit Alabama and learn how to make real southern food. They assured me that he HAD visited Alabama and spent a whole 10 days there. You can't learn BBQ in 10 days. Good BBQ chefs have spent well over 10 years learning to make it. Pot Liquor does not serve southern BBQ or any southern dishes. I may try them again in a couple years if they haven't gone out of business. Perhaps by then they will have found a cook book and learned to make some actual southern food."
340	2	a	My son tried this restaurant once and wanted to take me (and a friend). We arrived, and the hostess recognized him and welcomed him like a long lost friend. The rest of the staff was just as terrific. The food was the best BBQ I have ever had in a restaurant. Our entrees were the spareribs, baby back ribs and the brisket sandwich. Huge portions! All of the ribs were very meaty, excellently spiced, and delicious. Our sides included the mac and cheese (excellent), the corn muffins (addictive), and the fries. I loved the kale and cashew salad!  We tried the pork bellies and grits as an appetizer. Amazing! Very creative dessert menu! The best was that our server Les took us back through the kitchen to see the smoker. Got to meet the owner- very fun and appreciated!  Our server has an extensive restaurant background and it showed. We will definitely be consistent customers.
341	2	a	"Very interesting place.  The tables are spread out, making it a good place to hang out with friends, since you aren't crammed in.  The decor is nice, the hostesses cute, basically everything you'd expect out of a Town Square restaurant.\n\nThe manager is super welcoming, has real conversations with the patrons, and seems legitimately interested in talking to people, not just the \""is everything fine?\"" line that a lot of managers have as they run around the restaurant.  \n\nThe food is interesting and unique.  Here is my take.\nThe food is reasonably priced for Las Vegas BBQ, which is to say, unreasonably priced anywhere else, but thats par for the course here.\n\nThe meat is all smoked in a real smoker that uses real wood, I've seen the smoker, you can see the wood piled around the restaurant.   The pork seems like good pork (though I'm not a huge fan of pork), the brisket was very tender and flavorful, which IMO means its a shame that they don't have more beef products, I bet they'd be great.  \n\nSo what I've had thus far.\nBacon Steak - Uncured, its like a pork loin.  Its \""good\"", but I prefer cured bacon.\nHot Links - Excellent.  The herbs taste \""bright\"", probably freshly made there.  Not  spicy, I'd say a 5 or less, I can't perceive heat below a 7 at this point, but another person at a table said it had a \""kick\"", thus my impression that its a 5.  It was a very \""different\"" flavor, some might not like it, but I say give it a chance.\nMac & Cheese - I don't eat it, but everyone else seemed to love it.\nPot Pie - The pastry is puff pastry in an interesting latticework pattern floating on top of the chicken soup.  The chicken soup is amazing, the puff pastry is puff pastry (blandish).\nSweet Potatoes - Interestingly served with lemon zest giving it a citrusy freshness that I disliked and everyone else really loved.  They put marshmallow cream on top and toasted it, which I now do on my own sweet potatoes, but I leave out the lemon zest.\nBrisket Hamburger - This was amazing, a very generous portion of brisket, a great tasting hamburger, good bun.  Really tasty.  I ate my leftovers cold the next day and was yummy.\nFrench Fries - Yummy thick cut french fries.  Not necessarily fancy, but seemed fresh (but none of the burnt starch problem like a lot of fresh fries, which I like.\npork ribs of various types - nice amount of meat, smokey flavor, its pork, probably good.\n\nFor dessert, we've had the pumpkin fried pies and had brownie bread budding.  My friend loved the brownie bread pudding, but IMO it was overly toasted, with a slightly burnt flavor.  My friend likes burnt brownies so whatever.\n\nSo in the end, I didn't love the place as much as I do Lucilles.  Its not an apples & apples comparison, Pot Liquor doesn't have baked potatoes nor beef ribs, two of the most ordered things I get at Lucilles.  Pot Liquor made me go outside of my box for a lot of things, which is interesting and revitalizing.  My friends might want to go a lot, they seemed to like the flavors more than I did.  \n\nI would like to experience beef ribs here, and I'd like to try the brownie bread pudding again to see if they intentionally make it that dark."
342	1	a	Went here for lunch expected amazing food however recieved mediocer food and our service was aweful. She started off well and never followed through. I don't recommend it unless service improves.
343	2	a	Pretty happy with my first meal of the year in 2015. The family and I decided to hit up the new Town Square BBQ joint called Pot Liquor. I was thrilled when there wasn't a huge crowd for the holiday. It smelled delicious upon entry, and my expectations were pretty high. \nThere was a beautiful chandelier made from musical instruments that was a perfect decor for the atmosphere they were going for. Jazzy, blues, Bbq, bar yet family style type of place. The staff was friendly, and seemed to already have regular customers as they recognized numerous guests. \nMy family ordered three appetizers; pork rinds, deviled eggs, and burnt ends. The deviled eggs came with a chicken skin crisp crumble over the top and added a spectacular crunch. The pork rinds were basic but good. And the burnt ends were the first thing gone on the table. We were also presented a sauce sampler with four different styles of sauce to pair with your meat. The first, a sweet classic barbeque sauce. The second was similar to the first, but more spicy than sweet. I would have preferred more spice actually. The third was a cider vinegar they suggest you try with pork. I enjoyed it, the vinegar was not too overwhelming. And then my personal favorite, the white sauce. They describe this as, mayo, horseradish, and seasonings. Don't pass up on the random white sauce, its freakin' great! \nFor our entree we went with a Lord Have Mercy platter. The waitress insisted that with all this meat, between the four of us, we would most likely have leftovers. (Note: myself, my bf, our kids ages 17 & 12) The entree included:  1/2 smoked chicken, 6 baby back ribs, 6 dry rubbed spareribs, Carolina pulled pork, 4 Louisiana hot links and three sides. Let's just say, we were stuffed, yet our waitress was indeed impressed. Everything had a real smoked flavor. No shortcuts used with this BBQ. \nI also got an order of the breakfast brisket hash, because for $20 it came with unlimited Bloody Mary's, so that was a deal in itself! This is usually a weekend brunch special, but they were offering it because of the holiday. The bloody was great, I had 3 of them, and was feeling it towards the end. \nDon't ask me how we ate dessert, but we did. I felt like a family of food critics trying everything on the menu, the kids did great. We had the deep fried banana split (huge and awesome) and the strawberry shortcake sandwiches. Just get those, don't even ask, just do it. \nDuring our meal, the general manager Francis stopped by our table to ensure satisfaction. Although he was a Cowboys fan, we set aside our football differences and he gave us a coupon for 10% off, that we were able to use that day. The waitress even let us keep the coupon, which is cool because we totally will be returning to this place.
344	2	a	It was my first time here. I ordered the Chicken Pot Pie and the Pork Rinds. First out were the pork rinds, they looked store bought, but I gave them a shot...nope, tasted store bought as well. It felt to me like they just warmed them up and served them. Not impressed. Next out was the pot pie. Not a traditional looking pot pie. It had a lattice  pattern crust just laying on top. The crust was very buttery, so much so it over powered the rest of the flavors in the pie. The veggies were a disappointment as well. Tasted and looked as if they were from a can of veggie medley. \n   Now the good news, a gentleman (who I assume was the manager) came to ask how my meal was and I told him. He told me how they were planning to take the pot pie off the menu for some of the reasons I had described and replaced my pork rinds with the Grilled Bacon appetizer. Now that was amazing! Think cut bacon steaks with a jalape\u00f1o jelly that had just the right kick and a slaw of pickled cucumbers and carrots. That made up for my entire meal. And the fact the management was concerned enough to ask about my meal because he didn't see me touching the pork rinds let me know they care about their food. I'll be returning to find an entree I really enjoy as I found my appetizer.
345	2	a	I went here with my friend cuz he tried before~. Love the food here~ the coconut dessert is my favor~ the BEEF RENDANG and ROTI CANAI taste so good!!! The restaurant is clean which is good!  I will coming back and try something else next time!
346	2	a	Always a good staple in the community for groceries. If you like fresh and quality, this is your place to shop. \n\nNow closer to my side of town, in and out convience for parking, however, (not during the up coming holiday season as I am sure this place will be crowded!) it will be more of a quick trip for me now. \n\nI can always find something new to try, today we're trying their mac n cheese, heard it was suppose to be good. Also picked up some can delights for my fur balls, they always enjoy a little pate for dinner. \n\nClean, friendly staff, knows their stuff, very helpful!
347	1	a	Wow. I ordered 2 sandwiches and one of them was adequate, but the other one  (for my husband) had 1 thin slice of ham and 1 thin slice of turkey on it. Way too much lettuce and barely any mayo. Completely tasteless.  Step it up guys!  There is a Capriotti's less than a mile away that never disappoints!
348	2	a	I first came to Dewain, owner,  for his service a while back and this review is overdued. I seek his tint service when he was first opening his doors so he was able to go above and beyond on my car. The car that was worked on had caked on tint from the car's pervious owner and Dewain offered a free removal if I did a complete tint knowing how bad it was. Which I did. He even went out of his way to have him and his staff pick up the vehicle. So I never had to leave the house. Probably because he was still in a Grand Opening he had the availability and it was much appreciated. The tint itself came out great. And the price just can't be beat. Any competition watch out.
349	1	a	This place sucks. Rude Aggressive owner, Insult comedy, Go there if you like being treated like crap and offended.  Zero stars would be more accurate.
350	2	a	"Went to see Rocky Laporte here new years day and can say this is a great comedy venue!  Its no hassle parking (structure extremely close by), not overly cramped seating, and a great looking place.  One extremely important PSA for this place is the FOOD IS AWFUL.  Not that I expected anything special, but for those hoping of having a meal there think more airplane or microwave meals than actual food (for 10-13 dollars a \""dish\"").  With that being said this is a comedy club and not a restaurant so that's why I dont hold that to my rating.  Special shout out goes to Kathleen the audience member rocky loved for this particular show."
351	1	a	"A bit dirty, quite dysfunctional, and disappointing is how I would summarize this hotel. \n\nWe stayed there nights. The TV would not work at all. We called and they sent up a technician. First they came to look at it and said the remote was broken. They never came back. I called again, but the \""engineers are busy tonight, there are lots of maintenance calls.\""\n\nThe next day I called again. This time they came with a new remote, but that didn't fix it. They promised to come back and look at it again.  They never returned. \n\nThe 3rd day, I called again. They never came to fix the tv. They never offered to switch rooms. When I asked, they would say to call back again as they didn't know what rooms they had available. I gave up since this was out last night. \n\nThe room was also a bit dirty. There was mold and filth on the ceiling of the bathroom. It looks like the changed out a light fixture and never cleaned up.\n\nThere was also a stain on the carpet. And most obviously there was a giant stain on the bench in to room. So obvious, it's the first thing you see when you walk into the room.  I should have just tried to change to a new room when I first noticed that."
352	1	a	HORRIBLE SERVICE. \nThe girls that work the line here have such terrible attitudes & their appearance makes me wish I went to the freaking McDonalds next door. A girl cutting chicken literally had a pack of cigarettes right next to her on the counter and another had a pack sticking completely out of her pocket. The girl that was cleaning tables was standing by the soda machine from the time I got there until I left talking to her friend. Save your time and go elsewhere, even the portions they give you at this location are not worth what you're paying. They put the food on your plate as if they're scared to put the right amount. I'm just going to keep going to the Centennial location, where you can tell the staff got trained and knows how to give good service. Even if it is a further drive. Oh, and the 1 star is for the cashier who is the only one that had a good positive attitude.
353	1	a	This place is a joke they think their burgers are made of gold...  I wanted to like this place but the truth is no matter how good your burger is paying 17 dollars for a half pound burger fries and a small drink is ridiculous.   It is just like the overpriced indulge burger that used to be in this location that closed down.  I will not be coming back here as I don't like paying ridiculous prices for things that are not that great to begin with.  The bun is super small,  the burger is greasy,  non seasoned and tasteless for only 10 bucks.  I guess the fries are okay for only 4 bucks more.  Then you pay 3 bucks for a cup that holds about 5 cents of soda.   I don't see this place being here long.
354	1	a	Ordered take out and it was 20 minutes late.  Understandable with as busy as they were one table was filled with no food on the table just empty containers watching the World Series.  I assume they had been there a while.  \n\nFried okra very small portion, nothing to rave about.  But they have a good ceaser salad, again very small.\n\nThe meat the pulled pork was actually shredded which I appreciate.  Just a little dry, very little smoke.  The chopped brisket was really dry, not quite leathery but close.  Again where is the smoke?  Okay marinated chicken is gonna make up for it.  The marinade shined through the absent smoke ring and again where is the smoke.  They had a smoker in there it must be broken.\n\nNothing made me even want to give this place another shot.
355	2	a	This place is awesome, glad they opened up because all there locations were far from me. The staff is friendly and fun. Cant go wrong with anything i order here, everything is delicious!  Its a nice open place so there is plenty of seating. This is the best canes in town i think (:
356	2	a	Great food. I'm trying to promote for you but your website doesn't work. It would be nice to have a online menu. Just a suggestion.
357	1	a	Went for the grand opening weekend and decided to give this place a try. Was told 30-45 min wait but actually ended up being 1.5 hours. (Party of 2) There was empty tables every where and a ton of staff but they weren't seating all the tables? I was surprised how unorganized the front seemed there was like 5 hostesses and guest waiting everywhere even blocking the entrance and exit and the staff running around like chickens w/ their heads cut off. (Get it together, you should know it was going to be slammed)  A positive was that they have a text feature so you can go shop and walk around and they'll send you a text when your table is ready. The calamari was delicious , the Lobster pasta was really good and the 100% grass feed burger was ok. I waited about 20 mins for my Appetizer, I ordered bread and it didn't even come out until my food arrived. Like really? \n\nI'm almost positive that the reviews that gave 5 stars for the opening weekend are either workers and/or family of workers because that place was chaos and definitely NOT 5 star material. Some of the reviews even sounded scripted. It does have good potential though. \n\nManagement: Even when stressed your staff needs to smile. The front needs to be more controlled it was a mess and the hostesses looked annoyed when asking how much longer. Service was slow. Super busy weekend should have been expected and planned for.
358	1	a	This place was such a bad first time experience that I just HAD to write my first review!!! \n\nFirst off when you walk in there's a wait just to put your name on the list. They put your first and last name in the system then give you a waiting pager. They seemed so unorganized like they didn't know what they were doing. The wait was an hour long so we decided to walk around downtown summerlin and check it out.. About 40 minutes passed by so we checked to see how much longer. They said about 4 more people were in front of us still so we waited some more.... About 15 more minutes passes by so we check how much longer again and she said 2 more people were still ahead of us but since we were in there she'll just seat us. I don't know if that was a good or bad thing because if she let us cut in front of people imagine how many people she let cut in front of us?! \n\nSo now that we're seated let me say... She gave my boyfriend and I the WORST table. It was so tiny right in between the bar and the bigger tables. We were so close to the family sitting on the side of us. The space was so tight the servers were having a hard time squeezing through to drop off and pick up food. \n\nNow for drinks I ordered a white sangria. Our server bragged about how delicious and popular that drink was and how I'm gonna love it...... Then he comes back and says they're all out!!! Really?! Got my hopes up! So I went with the blueberry lemonade.. It was good-- super minty from the mint leaves. My boyfriend just got a Stella.. Nothing to mess up there. \n\nAs for food.. The menu was on the pricier side. Their pastas ranged from 20-30$... 18$ for some Mac n cheese!!! They have a sushi side of the menu too but I didn't order any sushi. My boyfriend got the crave burger and the fries tasted over-cooked. The food was just okay. \n\nMainly went to check out the new mall and decided we'll stop by and eat there and it was just bad. They are the only restaurant open right now so I understand that's why they were so busy but they just seemed  so unorganized. Probably will give them another shot again like later later once they figure themselves out.
359	1	a	Tried 4 different flatbreads, 3 sushi, lobster linguini, meat balls, 3 different beers, cocktails, and white wine, nothing is good. The only thing that is fine is the chicken flatbread. \nThe server, Darius, is attentive and friendly while others are not.\nWill not come back unless I take my puppy here to enjoy their patio and open air.
360	1	a	The place was not even half full and it took almost 15 minutes to get a drink from the bar.  Service was very poor in general.  I had the lamb meat balls for twenty some dollars and was less than impressed.  There were only a few and were only an inch or so in diameter. Others had the bison burger which was ok,  but it is hard to mess up a burger. With all the great dinning options in town I doubt I will go back and will not be recommending this place to anyone.  Oh and their largest beers are small and over priced as well.
361	1	a	The worse service I've ever experienced. It too almost an hour to get our food and then my granddaughters pizza was cold. We sent it back and it took another 20 minutes.
362	1	a	I was shocked at how bad this place was - especially because it looked so good, it it was always crowded. The concept is great - with dim sum carts rolling along and lots of noodle dishes, mostly Taiwanese. \n\nHowever, in the end, not one dish was as good as any decent Chinese place in San Gabriel or Arcadia in So Cal, nor did it setttle as well. \n\nBesides being super expensive, at eight bucks per dim sum and over 10 for a small bowl of noodles... but I spent the entire next day on and off the porcellin throne. \n\nAnd it wasn't just me -- my friend who I went to Yong Kang with had the same problem.\n\nI reall wish it was better. But FYI... Las Vegas has a great Chinatown - with good dim sum in carts on weekends and great Cantonese BBQ & Seafood places for dinner. There is also excellent Korean in Vegas. And the Chinatown is only 10 mins from the strip.\n\nBon Appitite.
363	1	a	I should have known better than to come here. The food was awful. I ordered the Dandan Noodles. I struggled to eat  my entree and could only finished it because I forced myself to, and it was a painful experience. My girlfriend agreed that it sucked. We had better Chinese and Japanese food in Vegas both at higher and lower price points.
364	1	a	I will give zero star if I can. Bad service. Dim sum is just so so. Rice noodle is the worst I ever have in the restaurants----a few and very very short noodle and 3 fish balls (which  taste like the one I buy in any market).
365	1	a	$19.99 for beef noodle soup ? Ha ha ... It's just better go china town to eat other beef noodle soup ! After I had this beef noodle soup I felt super thirsty for whole afternoon . I was super regret why I picked this place to eat !! The service was ok !!! \n\nMy advice : 1. Save your money to go China town to eat better noodle with fair price . \n\n2. Don't even try the Dim sum !!!
366	2	a	Can't say enough good things about the Sandovals or the Carlson Gracie Team. It is a fantastic environment, for adults, teens and kids. The Jiu-Jitsu pedigree of the coaches is top of the line. Add to that their personal investment in each student, their philosophy on physical and mental fitness, and the humble, fun and challenging manner in which they teach. Great place, great people and real, no-nonsense Jiu-Jitsu. You're wasting your money if you go anywhere else.
367	2	a	love the location, love the soft sno, love that youre open on sundays but i beg of you: bring back polar berry!!!
368	2	a	Goodness gracious. Put your big pants on. Parking costs $5. Er-ma-gawd. (Apparently that was an issue with other reviewers.) Carpool if it helps.\n\nReady now?\nPrepared?\n\nI had the delight of giggling like a kid tonight. We came in a large group and I was up front for a section. (The people including spoilers in their reviews clearly dropped their ice cream.) \n\nWhile coming as a large group is fun, it's even better to be broken into smaller groups. This way the mystery of what is around a bend is... A mystery.\n\nI gotta tell you: \nThere was screaming.\n\nSure, everyone has their strengths. (Apparently I'm not afraid of the dark. Who knew?) Put me near someone in costume who looks like a doll? One that follows you like a shadow?\n\nI SCREAM.\nNo shame there.\n(I swear she was eight.)\n\nI've never been a fan of scary movies. I cover my eyes the entire time. This was a different kind of fear. A mixture of the unknown, group dynamics, sound and beer. (They serve that outside!)\n\nFantastic way to kick off Halloween!\n\np.s. Photos are *not* allowed. \n(Outside by the bar and stage are ok.)
369	1	a	I tried the corn chowder soup with lump crab, caesar salad, and the fish of the day with fries. This was my first time here so I didn't know what to expect. I wasn't thrilled about any of the dishes. Soup was OK, nothing I would go out of my way for. The caesar salad was pretty tasteless. I didn't finish my salad because it wasn't good at all. The fries were overcooked and dried out as if they reheated old fries. The fish of the day was cooked nicely but too much seasoning for my taste. I won't be itching anytime soon to return back here. The service was good. The manager checked up on us and the decor is modern and clean. Just wish the food was better.
370	1	a	"Simply stated, everyone should be aware that this establishment refuses to accommodate any food allergies or food related diseases. \n\nWhile I have a number of food allergies, I am definitely not one of those individuals who asks for outrageous customizations to the menu in order to be accommodated and I have never had to walk out of a restaurant due to a refusal to be served - not even in France, where I had to ask (in English!) to have my meal prepared without butter. So, imagine my surprise when I sat down with my extended family, for a birthday dinner for my aunt, and the waiter flat out refused to serve me one of the salads on the menu without dressing and a side of olive oil and vinegar. I did not ask for a dish to be prepared differently, only to not have salad dressing. I explained to the waiter it was a severe allergy and that I would only be ordering wine and the salad and he was so rude and obnoxious in his refusal that he reduced me to tears in front of 8 family members. \n\nNeedless to say, my fianc\u00e9 and I left the restaurant and my aunt's celebration and will never return to this establishment. From what I understand from those that stayed, the salads were all prepared with far too much dressing, their version of \""al dente\"" pasta is literally a workout to chew and is really nothing more than under-cooked and the service and attitude of the staff never improved. With so many options available in Las Vegas and even just within the Paris, I would be surprised to see this place still in business when I next return."
371	2	a	Anne Marie with AMRE Holistic Healing & Massage has wow-ed me from day one!! I am thrilled to have found her; especially during planning a wedding and moving a business where my body was needing a lot more work than usual. Her touch and combination of different techniques is top notch and truly one of a kind. I would totally recommend her to anyone needing deep work without feeling like it is deep tissue and still relaxing at the same time!!  I love that I can contact her pretty spur of the moment and she can get me in to see her pretty quickly! Thank you Anne Marie!! Looking forward to my next massage!!
372	2	a	Mike did an awesome job replacing my iPhone 5s screen, had it replaced in a mater of 5 minutes on a Saturday!  Highly recommend him!
373	2	a	This place is amazing! They have the best acai and pitaya bowls in town. Their servings are very generous compared to most places and they have great service. Try this place and you won't be disappointed.
374	2	a	Very happy with my experience here! The girls up front where very helpful finding the right bowl for us and made sure we knew everything that it contained before it was made. Used to go to Juice N Go often but I think this might have to be my new spot!
375	2	a	I went to this place a few days ago.  I thought the food was really good, but it wasnt hot enough.  I got the Pho dip and the best part about pho is the hot broth.  The broth was barley warm.  my fiance got the shrimp po boy, which had great flavorm but again it wasnt warm enough.  We got the thai clam chowder, that was great and it was nice and warm.  The only thing was they served it with to go plastic spoons.  Im being really picky, but it would have been nice to have it with an asian style soup spoon.
376	2	a	The sandwiches taste great. The pho dip is very flavorful and the meat is rare and comes with crunchy bean sprouts.The Sezchuan shrimp po boy is my favorite. The spicy mayonnaise goes great with the crispy shrimp. Thai clam chowder is pretty good, it's a little spicy and not as thick as regular clam chowder.\n\nI am not a big fan of the sides I tried. The dragons breath fries were kinda soggy and I though they could've been spicier. The chips that come with the sandwiches are soft and soggy also. \n\nThe restaurant is very clean. Staff is very polite. There's several different hot sauces for you to try.\n\nThere's a punch card you can get. You get stamps for buying sandwiches, salads or flat breads. The 10th one is free.
377	1	a	I don't know whats the problem but looks like they are closed. I've been calling them for 2 days but no one is answering the phone....
378	1	a	Such a disappointment after I've heard this place is good- wings tasted ok but were really little. The fries have something like a sugar salt on it and it gets really gross after just a few bites. Mine were also drenched in this mystery coating so you didn't even know you were eating fries. The roll also had a very sweet taste to it. I lost my appetite after the second bite of each item. Veggies were the only good part of this meal and those are hard to mess up. I won't be going back, that's for sure!
379	2	a	Bought our wood flooring and tile from this store. Bill spent 2 hours with us helping to select our wood floors, and he was very helpful. I came back the next week and designed 3 bathrooms with Bill. He was amazing at putting flooring, wall, and accent tiles together. We shopped for 4 hours straight, filled 2 carts, and then he meticulously loaded all the tile into my vehicle. Bill is talented, joyful, and first class all the way. This store is clean, organized, and has a huge selection. The manager Heather introduced herself and shook my hand. Great customer service all the way. Financing was a 5 minute procedure at a kiosk. Take the amount you are approved for on the kiosk print out to the register when you check out. Love the 0% for 16 months deal. Don't waste your time at other stores. This is a one stop shop.
380	2	a	LOVE this place,  the food so amazing and so is the service.   Every time I eat   there  the food is perfect and delicious,  the steak skewers have the most tender perfectly seasoned taste.    They just opened this 3rd location at downtown summerlin and they are very busy with a wait sometimes,  but that is because they are SO good!   Crazy Pita is Crazy Good !
381	1	a	The food wasn't bad, but it was incredibly slow service. It took forever to place an order and there was no one in line. I probably won't be back .. I can't stand slow service
382	2	a	Hilarious, hilarious, hilarious! One of the best comedy shows I've seen in Las Vegas, and I've been to the comedy club at Ballys and Tropicana several times. I got the tickets comped through showtickets4locals.com, so I was skeptical of the caliber of the show. However, my girlfriend and I were sidesplitting laughing the entire time! I would highly recommend for anyone who is looking for and affordable night comedy in Las Vegas.
383	2	a	I support local businesses and this place is a great little coffee/sandwich/salad shop. It's a father/daughter run team and they are very friendly and pleasant people. I've been in several times and haven't tried anything I didn't like. Their cookies are amazing! Atmosphere is cozy and there is a great outdoor patio area as well. You won't be disappointed.
384	1	a	One word review: Overhyped. The long version: The place was clean, and the service was fast and friendly, but the food is overpriced mediocritize. Trying to eat a little healthier, I opted for the chicken. The sandwich was ok. Good size, with plenty of topping options, but nothing much above average. The fries were shoestrings. Great if you are courting the under 10 crowd, but odd for a premium burger place. All in all you can get the same, or better quality food at In n Out Burger down the street, for half the price. A chicken/vegeburger option isn't enough to bring me back.
385	1	a	Was hoping for a decent Mexican restaurant in South Chandler but instead got a Mexican Denny's. Lots of sloppy food with no taste and a bit overpriced. Do have a nice patio and drinks were OK if that's all your looking for.  Too bad doubt it will last very long. Take your money elsewhere.
386	2	a	Compare to the rest of the nordy rack stores, this one by far has no good items. Couldn't find anything good here.
387	1	a	"You guessed it ... another Rent-a-Car centre one-star from this yelp.com user.\n\nThis is not isolated stuff here. \n\nEvery one of these companies at McCarran bait and switch, accept reservations (even pre-paid), and then do not honour. \n\nThe following is my firsthand experience with Thrifty:\n\nIt was late Thursday night. I guess it was during Spring Break (how this is germane is beyond me, but it was brought up by an employee). I had already been turned away by several McCarran companies, like E-Z, Firefly (rentals, not the restaurant with horrific health code violations), and maybe another. \n\nI quickly make a reservation on my fancy phone via carrentals.com. Just 15$/day, which seemed like a steal at the time, especially with my 12$/day pre-paid reservation at E-Z not being honoured, and enormous queues at Hertz and Payless, but when I reach the counter I am informed they have no cars. I can wait until 0400 -- I am told (it is 0030 at this point) -- or, I can accept a hook-up to an unnamed company (different from Thrifty) for fifty (50) dollars ($) a day. Fifty! \n\nYou see ... it was either agree to fifty a day or wait for four or more hours for a car. And this was some other company -- one that was never named -- that this Thrifty employee was referring me to. Paraphrasing here: \""If you walk up right now, it would be eighty a day. I can get your fifty because this is my friend and I will be sending you to them.\"" Later, she repeated this line, but mistakenly estimated the walk-up rate now to be ninety (90), because of \""Spring Break.\"" You can't make this shit up. \n\nAfter I say no, politely, I sit for about five minutes or less -- no bullshit -- and, the same employee tells me to head back to the counter because they had my car. The 15$/day car. My untested hypothesis is that it was there all along. \n\nIt had Colorado plates and was filthy, inside and out. I turned it in cleaner after the weekend than it was when dispatched to me."
388	1	a	Horrible service well at least Michael. ( bald gentlemen )  I have never seen such a horrible rude customer service representative.  I have always said I will only leave positive yelps but I can not help myself. As a consumer I have never been treated and talked down to like that before. So sorry we didn't understand what you asked. If you hate your job so much move on !
389	2	a	Great food... Reasonably priced and great atmosphere. Used to be the old Orange Table...Paul & Lori have done a great job in calibration to transform this establishment into a great place to eat & drink...check it out!
390	1	a	I was excited to try this place. I'm orginally from the Midwest and miss White Castle dearly. I'm sorry to say that this place hardly comes close. The burgers weren't that great tasting and despite just coming off a grill it was sort of cold (I ate one as soon as I got in the car) I was also expecting it to be in its own building with a drive thru but that wasn't a huge deal. I definitely wouldn't hesitate to make another trip if the food was good. The girl that took our order was really nice though. She had a short hair cut I should have gotten her name but unless something changes I won't be going back.
391	1	a	"This place is was not that great. Dim sum is outranglusly expensive for what it is ranging from \""that's kinda expensive\"" to \""wtf? That's it for that price???!\"",and the cart was only offered once....I thought they are suppose continuously come with more options....\n\nBut at least you get an option to choose entrees from a menu, offering dishes from other Asian menus (Vietnamese, tiawaneese...) me and my boyfriend ordered the minced pork meat over rice (only because so many reviews said it was great), it just tasted \""bleh,\"" and makes me leave thinking \""I should have just gone to get McD\""\n\nThe best part of my meal was the ice latt\u00e9 my boyfriend got me next door"
392	1	a	Came for lunch 10/17. Not busy at all yet been sitting for almost 10 min and not even greeted by a waiter/waitress.  Expect more from a new restaurant. Don't even care about the food at this point. With service this poor not likely to come back. The food was okay but nothing special.  The cole slaw  was the shredded cabbage mix that can be bought at a grocery store with a watered down bottled standard dressing.  Nothing that we need to have again
393	2	a	Hands down a 5. Not crowded, awesome decor and GREAT service. Very much appreciated the 20% military discount. Excellent food. My beer was served in a ball mason type jar. Happy hour is from 2pm - 7pm. First thing I saw was the pledge of allegiance on the wall when I walked in and thought damn right, this is America and I'm ordering a steak!
394	2	a	"So Marcus, the owner, saw my wife and I passing by starring into his sandwhich shop and poked his head out the window amd said \""We make a really mean grilled cheese, come on in\"". Graz just opened on Monday apparently he tells us as we skimmed over the menu. We decided to take his recommendations, the \""BL cheese\"" and the \""flying pig\"".\nSo freaking good. I really digged the BL cheese (hot sandwhich w/ cheddar tomatoes, mixed greens h bacon on sourdough). Tasted nice and fluffy not greasy like I was expecting. \nThe Flying pig  was really good too, Havarti cheese was a great touch but not sure how some people would feel about the herb spread. Can be strong for some. Reminded me of a strong honey mustard. \n\nOverall, definitely coming back. Would like to continue to support local business that has a great product. Come if your interested in a gourmet home cooked sandwhich"
395	2	a	"Yo!! \""Ichiban\"" (numero uno, haha) was my first impression!!\n\nWhy?!?!?  Because there was Japanese staff and cooks, plus Japanese people eating there, so I told myself \""self, Let's do this! \n\nI sat at the bar & the table next to me just got served a grilled saba (mackerel) dinner. Told waitress I want that and then the dude next to me was \""choppin\"" in this frickin badass Ramen that look awesome (I'll try it tomorrow) but his fried rice look scrumptious so I ordered that too!! \nFood came out perfectly just in time to finish this report and \""MOP-UP\"" this great ONO-Oishi\"" Japanese grinds. \n\n\""Mahalo-Gosaimas\""\n\nI really like and gave it 5 chop sticks!!"
396	1	a	horrible food.  tacky, dirty atmosphere.  honestly i'll never go back, the food quality is incredibly subpar.
397	2	a	Great Service. Friendly staff. I loved the prices and treatments. They will do good. Highly recommended
398	2	a	"RAISING THE MOVIE THEATER EXPERIENCE UP TO THE GALAXY \n\n  Remember the days when the movie theater was an ordinary experience? It seemed that a few years ago the movie theaters were small, it was hard to see in front of you, and the screen was a super-sized version of the flat screen TV. The Regal Downtown Summerlin Stadium 5 raises the movie theater experience to the next galaxy. \n\n  My brother and I had been hanging out in downtown Summerlin. The mall will see better days ahead. At the time of our visit, the majority of the restaurants and stores were not in business. After walking around Macy's, Dillards, and Downtown streets, the idea hit me to go to the movies. \n\n  As soon as we stepped inside the Downtown Summerlin Stadium 5, we entered the movie theater of the future. The ticket counter barricade is nonexistent. As soon we walked inside I saw a lobby of plush seating and tables surrounded by a bar, concession stand, and a ticket counter. I could just walk off a downtown Summerlin Street to pick up a cocktail and hang out. The truth is that with the scarcity of nightlife and bars in downtown Summerlin at the time of this review, this is a decent spot to drink a Cosmopolitan, Long Island Ice Tea, or cocktail. We weren't here for drinking. We were here to see a movie. \n\n  The movie ticketing counter is to the right of the lobby. On our visit their were two lines to purchase tickets for any of the five movies playing. If we were undecided about a movie, there was a sheet explaining what the movies were about. Once we decided, the friendly woman at the counter showed us the monitor displaying the available seats. Just like the Galaxy Theater chain that has revolutionized the Las Vegas movie theater scene, the seats here are assigned. This reminded me of my recent review on the Oriental Theatre in Chicago where you get assigned seats. The adult ticket price on a Sunday afternoon is $13.A bit pricey but you live once. But if we saw the matinee the ticket price would be around $10.\n\n  Now my eyes were on the concession stand. I love complimenting my movie experience with crunchy nachos with cheese and a large Coke. The Nathan's hot dog looked kind of good. But not tonight. The Downtown Summerlin Panda Express had filled me up. So, I'd compliment my movie theatre experience with a large Coke that came out to $6.50. The large Coke was refillable. After the movie I'd refill it for the walk back to Red Rock Casino Resort. If I wanted a sugar free Coke I could order Diet Coke or Coke Zero. \n\n  To the left of the bar is where you present the ticket to the woman standing there. Beyond the ticket gate was a small corridor attaching the five stadium seating theaters. \n\n The theater brought comfort up to the next galaxy. This was stadium seating on steroids. The space between rows was a mutant space where a professional wrestler could extend his legs out and they'd still be room for a person to walk by. And the seats. When I sat on the leather seat, I felt like I was in a LincolnTown Car. These seats make the typical theatre seats passe The soft to the touch leather seats included drink holders, what looks like arm trays and a button that reclines the seat up so that you are practically lying back watching the movie. The stadium seating alleviated any blind spot if a tall person were to have sat in front of me. \n\n  One thing that hasn't changed is the coming attractions. Regardless that the start time of \""To Kill the Messenger\"" was 5:10 pm, the coming attractions ended at 5:27 pm. \n\n  The movie screen was Academy Award Winning. The detail of the screen with the surround sound brought me a galaxy away from downtown Summerlin. But when you are relaxed and surrounded by comfort times goes fast. \n\n  As I walked toward the streets of Downtown Summerlin, I had a positive feeling  that the movie theater has made a comeback. This is a comeback that I have read about in the reviews for Galaxy Theaters, the innovators of the Las Vegas luxury movie theater scene. It is a comeback that encourages me to comeback to the newest luxury theatres for an Academy Award Winning movie theater experience."
399	1	a	I am a consummate Nordstrom's Rack shopper, whenever a new one opens within a 2 state area (California/Nevada) I try and make it out.  All of the best stuff seems to come when a new Rack opens.  I have been to upwards of 15 Nordstrom Racks and some are certainly better than other, however, none are worse than this one.  The Men's Department is laughably small and the selection is rubbish.  There was nothing at all that I could find to buy.  In fact I was so disheartened that I thought a little shopping might cheer me up and I went to the Rack in Henderson and purchased 2 sweaters.  I had high hopes for this new Rack but I doubt I will make the journey back out to Summerlin just for this store.  Very disappointed indeed.
400	2	a	My boyfriend and I were going to see a movie and were looking to grab some food beforehand. As we passed by, the owner came out and shook our hands and asked if we wanted a 25 cent hot dog for their grand opening. Hell yes. \n\nThe owner explained that the dogs and buns were gluten free and made with no hydrogenated oils which was huge for me, since I have a sensitive gut. My boyfriend was happy because Cajun fries. \n\nOverall service was great, the owner was enthusiastic and excited to make our experience good, and the food was delicious. A bit expensive for the combos but eh. It's north scottsdale.
401	2	a	Nice addition to this part of town as a local its nice to grab some snacks on way to container park amazing desserts!!!!! love the set up !!!
402	2	a	I don't even know where to begin!\n\nFood, ambiance, service, atmosphere, everything was above and beyond. \n\nWe were shopping at the Union and decided to stay there for dinner. Place looked great but since we never tried their food we were not sure what to expect. And then...What an amazing surprise...\n\nThe food was absolutely amazing. I had tomato basil soup, which was amazing. Then for the main course I ordered Baby Octopus that was served with mashed potatoes, old bay aioli and breadcrumbs. It was out of this world. The portion was really small but you do not want plate of entire octopus on it...just saying. \n\nMy boyfriend had Mushroom pizza with house made sausage, garlic and thyme. He was as well blown away. I had to have a piece because it looked so good and I didn't want him to eat entire pizza by him self . The crust was awesome. It was tender but yet crispy throughout.  It was full of flavors. I had to pick sausages out as I do not eat pork but he said they were the bomb. \n\nDrinks were to die for as well. We had Ways&Means (bourbon, sweet vermouth, 2 bitters, maple) and High Tide (gin, orange, lime, mint). They were very different from each other but flavors were amazing on both. \n\nService was just out of this world as well. Our server was really helpful by explaining the Menu, checking on us in timely manner and getting us exactly what we needed when we needed it. \n\nThis is a kind of a place that I will keep going back to. They have a beautiful fire pit outside, which is perfect to have a drink by on the semi-cold Phoenix nights. \n\nThank you unique but absolutely amazing Forge and crew, we will be coming back for sure!
403	2	a	The New Adrenaline Bar (Formally Cheyenne Saloon) Is Keeping The Vegas Live Music Scene Alive ! ! ! ! ! \nGreat New Stage And Sound....\nGreat Drink Price's.....\nAnd Awesome Pizza.....\nCheck It Out If You Haven't And Come Back If You Used To Come Here..............
404	2	a	My boyfriend and stopped in for a quick breakfast, so we just got coffee and pastries from the bar. I ordered a cappuccino, maple bacon donut, and a whoopie pie. The cappuccino and donut were delicious. We didn't really like the whoopie pie- so I would skip it. It looked cute though!  Overall, the food was yummy and the place was super hip. I would totally come again.
405	2	a	Being new to the city I am so glad I found this place. Awesome atmosphere, great people and a quality haircut to match. I'll be back again soon!
406	1	a	I purchased a Groupon deal for this groomer, they sold out of the small dog size deal and instead I purchased a medium size, thinking it wouldn't make a difference. I call to double check if it's ok to use this groupon to get my dog groomed when they tell me that they cannot honor it because of the fact that my dog is small and the groupon says it's for a medium-size dog. In my opinion it should not matter if I paid a little extra for medium-size groom when my dog is actually a small dog, I am very upset that I was not able to use this coupon because they made a big deal about it! I will make sure to let my contacts know to avoid this company and to go elsewhere because it doesn't make any sense as to why they wouldn't want to make money doing a small dog groom and me paying for a medium size groom price. It's very disappointing that they won't be getting any money from me!
407	1	a	This place is a new restaurant Hong Kong style,but the food is no really good like everybody talking about..we order the curry fish ball.,they just put the curry sauce on the fish ball,the fish ball it taste nothing...and we ask for the desert on the menu.,,they don't have ..,if you don't have any desert,why you put on your menu??
408	1	a	This was my 4th and last foodie fest. After selling out to take casino sponsorship the new location was a complete nightmare. 45 minutes in traffic to then pay $20 a couple as we witnessed many people sneaking in free. 5 of the advertised trucks to be there were not. Foodie fest started as a local event and turned into a strip location this year. #ThankYouForRuiningThisEvent #RedDragon has to go. #Fuku and #Snowono smart enough to skip this year!
409	2	a	Very cool there is now a Mediterranean/Greek/Middle Eastern joint in my area. Even cooler, they have delivery service 4 miles out! This place is in the strip mall where Naga and the yogurt place is. \n\nWhat I'm loving here are the non meat options that I had so far. \n\nSay yes to Eggplant Salad! Warm eggplant on bed of salad greens sprinkled with seasonings and almond slivers. The small size bowl was filled up plentiful of eggplant and perfect serving size for lunch.\n\nMy other favorite; the Vegetarian Combo Platter. It had many of my Greek and Middle East favorites,Baba Ganoush,Hummus,Grape Leaves, Falafel, and seasoned flat bread.  I enjoyed this dish! Although the hummus doesn't measure up to Bon Chef Cafe's version (I so miss Chef Ash!)\n\nThe Zatar seasoning that chef makes and uses in a lot of the dishes here is awesome!!! It was meticulously sprinkled on each slice of my flatbread. I had to comment and ask what's the deal with the spice blend he used because it's different from the Greek and Middle Eastern places I've been to. I learned from Chef Manny that his spice blend included thyme,sesame seeds, and ..I forget..but whatever it is, I was diggin it! Also he said he uses mint leaves and mentioned that he used it in the Eggplant Salad that I had couple weeks ago..(whoa dude remembered me??... xtra cool point!!!). I have to note from talking with him, he really takes pride in what he makes. I so appreciate that it's all made from scratch. \n\nThe Shrimp Kebab was also delish. A little confused though as to why it wasnt on a skewer. No biggie. It's nice that you can order it ala carte. And you can order the Beef, Chicken and Lamb kebabs too ala carte. \n\nThe only thing I wasnt too crazy about is the Tzatziki sauce...I want to say it's sour cream based. Kinda bland and consistency was just too thick and rich for my taste. It's all good though because the spices used in the gyro meat made up for it. But still a tad disappointing. But with the many menu choices that there are I can live without it. \n\nThey did a great job renovating the dining area. Smart use of space seating wise. Seems like a few more tables added than the previous tenants. (Fix8, Cino's, Lucca Deli)  Big plus to the TV  playing sports channel. I caught part of the baseball playoffs when I had a dinner break here.(Yay Giants!) \n\nPrice for lunch I found reasonable. It's fast/casual dining. Order at counter and they'll bring your food out to you. Service was good.  I found the staff pretty friendly and was impressed that Chef remembers his customers. The times I was there, there were quite a few regulars already coming and going to this fairly new place. Easy going dining experience. Ive got no major issues. For sure in my lunch/dinner rotation. Imma Fan!!! Four Stars!
410	1	a	Been to the Biltmore location many times but my wedge salad was drowning in dressing, the food took WAY too long to come out and I took a bite of my son's burger and almost had to spit it out. The banana cream pie was great but that graham cracker crust needs a hammer & chisel to get through.\nLove the wide open location!\nOverall, much too pricey for what you (don't ) get.
411	2	a	I got the classic but upgrades to the Kobe which was so tender and off the hook juicy and amazing.  Very cool place, open and trendy.  Had a really cool feel.  I also got the banana pie which was off the hook deliciously. Definitely highly recommend this place for a gourmet burger, best in Gilbert for sure!
412	2	a	We just left and will go back for burgers anytime we are in the mood.\n\n5 minute wait for a table is not shabby for Saturday. \n\nService was speedy and personable. \n\nSplit the Carmel milkshake with the wife and it was worth it.  I did not share my burger with her, as she pointed out to me after I was finished.  She enjoyed her burger and the fries. Both were cooked spot on temp wise and super juicy and tasty. \n\nShe said the best burger she can recall and I second that.
413	2	a	We have been to this location at least ten times, so obviously we are fans.  We have tried almost every burger on the menu at least once.  We have also sampled all of the side offerings.  We always order a Zucchini fries (with a side of the Truffle Aioli that comes with the truffle fries).  I am generally not a fan of vegetables disguising themselves as fries, but these are amazing.  Also, I am generally not a fan of $10.00 burgers and was pre-disposed to not like this place.  However, the burgers here are phenominal.  We can usually split one burger and one side (usually the green chile fries, but sometimes we venture out and try one of the others) and it is plenty for two of us (this is in addition to the aforementioned Zucchini fries, of course).  Our favorites are the Zinburger and the Plain and Simple (I even splurged once and got the Kobe style Plain and Simple - it was very good, but not good enough to justify the extra cost on a regular basis).  The onions on the Zinburger are braised in Zinfandel and very tasty.  Although I have not tried the Turkey burger, I have been told by several folks that have tried it that it is the best one they have tasted.  Flavorful and juicy.  \nYou should always find out what the burger of the day is - we have had some pretty amazing ones.\nThe shakes are also phenominal (although I prefer beer, I have tasted at least six different flavors of shakes and they were all outstanding).\nThe staff is great.  Very pleasant and generally attentive.  We did have one incident where our server apparently walked oof after taking our drink orders, but once the management was made aware they were on top of it immediately (and stayed on top of it throughout our stay).  The management staff is very friendly and they are always walking around checking things out and making small talk with the patrons.\nAll in all, for a higher end burger place, this is a very good choice (we can usually get out for under $30.00 for the two of us if it isn't Happy Hour - even less during HH).  This is propably my favorite place in Old Town Gilbert.
414	2	a	Second time here, first time wasn't super impressed but I think it's because we were comparing it to Hot n Juicys. If you want a trifeca sauce, I'd recommend HNJ... the trifeca sauce here is a little too oily and not juicy at all so it doesn't penetrate the shells. However this time we went with the waiters suggestion... PACIFIC RIM sauce. OH SO YUMMY! that was so delicious... Highly recommend
415	2	a	Finally found a great breakfast place close to home. Great service too! Real corn beef and hash and banana nut French toast....yummo.
416	1	a	THIS HOTEL IS A HORROR!  I find it hard to believe that anyone who has ever stayed at a hotel before, (anywhere & any rating all the way from the Holiday Inn to the Four Seasons), would write a positive review for this spot.\n\nI have nothing but negative things to say...\nI will elaborate when I check out. But for the time being I will say that the worst part is that I paid & furthermore splurged on this, my vacation...something I haven't done in years.  It also happened to be my bday & it was ruined by the unprofessisonal and imcompetance of the linq-i missed a bday dinner, a concert and worst of all-good times & memories...ultimately, all this was was money & time flushed down the drain. They didnt take accountability either & blammed hotels.com...i have photos/videos/& record from hotels.com as documentation to prove this to be true. \nThe one star I gave is for brooklyn bowl, otherwise if yelp allowed for it, i wouldn't give one at all.\n\nUPDATE:\nThe entire day I've called to request a blanket that every other room has on their bed. I spoke with someone more then 5x. Each time they either ignored or forgotten about my request OR are they are actually incompetant, which I'm starting to believe to be the reason.\n\nA pool is advertised, there is no pool. It is under construction. \n\nThe room service only operates from 7AM-1PM. \n\nElevators are for the most part broken & don't always run...best option is to use the stairs. \n\nMANAGMENT IS COMPLETELTY UNQUALIFIED TO OVERSEE A HOTEL & WITH THAT, A NEW HOTEL IN LAS VEGAS...ONE OF THE MOST POPULAR  DESTINATION SPOTS IN THE WORLD.  I FEEL LIKE THEY OWE ME $ FOR WASTING MY VACATION TIME, THEIR FALSE ADVERTISING, INABILITY TO ACCOMADATE & UNHOSPITALITY.\n\nDon't bother booking anything but a standard room because they ignore requests and will put u in a standard room, which I'm assuming is all they really have...\n\nHORRIBLE.  DON'T LET THIS HOTEL STEAL YOUR MONEY.
417	1	a	The place stinks of smoke like when it was the Imperial. The rooms are tiny. The WIFI works about half the time or less. The casino area is small, the only saving grace is the staff are attentive.\nThe bars and restaurants on the walk way are all nice.
418	1	a	Hmmm let's see , we have a reservation a Guys and of course the husband wanders off. I stop and ask where he is heading the casino. I shrug like whatever I'll wander with the kiddos. Turn to walk away to get stopped by svete the rentacop. No kids in the casino!  Oh no I reply we are going to the restaurant . No you and the kids have to go outside.  I'm like ... Whaa?  The hotel is jammed packed with children walking the same areas no one is in the casino so why can't we go to the restaurant?  No children must wait outside. It's in the 30s and we are guests seriously? .  Husband runs back like no no I won't gamble, we'll just walk on. No children need to go outside. That's where I'm about done . I ask him if he realizes we are guests and it's freezing and since hubs is there he's is like oh no you can walk on. Seriously ?? I go to management and yep his name was Carlos Santana (total double take) he agrees it's cold and if the kids were able to move on it shouldn't be a problem. But outside is completely illogical especially when it's cold. Regardless this place has left a bad taste in my mouth. The amount of people complaining before me should have given me a clue at the quality of service.  Staying at the Cosmo
419	1	a	I DON'T RECOMMEND STAYING IN LINQ HOTEL IN VEGAS. First of all, you come to your room around 3 am and construction starts around 6 am.. It's a loud freaking noise like they are digging or drilling asphalt constantly. It's very loud and annoying. Second, your phone doesn't work In this big building, it's 21th century and phone doesn't work. That's so stupid. Third, if you ask for extra blanket, they only give per person. Their none working Wifi that keeps dropping is limited to two device and for each extra device you have to pay $13... stupid.. If my own phone was working in their vicinity then I had less problem but your phone doesn't work so we used our two device limit for me and my husband's phone so we couldn't even connect our iPads or laptops because was stupid to pay $13.99 box extra for each device... The casino has no good ventilation and it's like you are walking in a smoke room. There is no central air condition unit in the room and it's loud like the one in old motels...Anyhow for the price we paid I could have stayed in a 4 star hotels but we decided to stay here given that it was a newer  built but that was mistake.
420	2	a	"I'm part of the Phoenix-area comedy scene and we were given the opportunity to practice our bits every Sunday night.  We did one show in the Upstairs room and most of the comedians bombed on stage because everyone's ADD kicked in when they saw all of the things hanging on the walls and ceiling.  Sometimes that happens with people in new rooms who are less experienced in comedy (like me), but it was insane watching even the most experienced comedians do poorly at that show.  With that being said, it didn't work out the way we wanted to and we're not allowed back in, but I have no hard feelings and I hope they give us another shot.\n\nAnyway, 5-stars because this place is amazing.  Beautiful patio outside of the building, and then you walk in and the further you trek, the weirder and wilder it gets!  You think to yourself \""hey, can it get weirder than this?\""  Oh yes it can!  And it does from the very moment you take your first step upstairs....I can't even explain the upstairs room.  You need to check it out if you want your mind to be blown to pieces.  \n\nI wish I could talk about the food, but I got here at 10pm when the kitchen closes, so make sure you get earlier if you want food on a Sunday.\n\nIt's too bad we can't do comedy here anymore because it's such a fun room!  We're sorry we weren't funny enough for Minder Binders."
421	2	a	Love this place! This is a new location that is in a perfect place for me by the mall. The people are always welcoming and remembered me after I came in a few times in a week because I can't get enough!! Their sauce is the best. My friends and I meet there on a regular basis now. :) Thank you canes!!
422	1	a	Ordered delivery, they forgot half of the order. \nTried to call them to TELL them that half my order was missing - they didn't answer. Had to call 20 times until they picked up. \nAnd the food wasn't worth the price. \nSMALL portions, lacking flavor, not fresh ingredients.
423	1	a	If you don't mind or are used to being treated like you really don't matter or just another patient, this is certainly the place to go to.  I don't know if she was just having a bad day, but the woman in scrubs at check in this afternoon 10/21/2014  was very smug and  had a scowled look on her face.  I was going to use Dr. Stein to perform a preventive screening colonoscopy and was told I would not be meeting him until right  before the procedure.  Seems to me that if you are going into the doctors office to set up the procedure and paying the specialist insurance copay you would at least meet the doctor before.  I really felt like they cared less about me personally and also my business.  Guess they have enough business looking at the parking lot and waiting room.  I decided not to use them and opted to use someone a little more personable and caring.  This place looks like it is run like a production line, herd em in and herd em out.
424	1	a	"Went on Saturday 12/20/14 for lunch and the 3 of us were seated immediately which was nice, however, we ordered and waited an hour for our food while others around us who were seated after us were being served. Just as we were trying to track down an employee to call a manager to our table after waiting an hour for our food, the server walking towards us had 2 of our 3 plates. We asked him to have the manager come to our table and his response was \""but I have your food here, do you not want it?\"". One of my friends stated \""Surely, we will take the food but can you please still have a manager come see us?\"". We had no silverware to begin eating and waiting for the 3rd plate. We had to track down another waitress and ask for a manager again as some time had passed and there was still no manager in site, nor the 3rd plate of food. The 3rd plate of food finally came out and we asked for silverware and began eating. Throughout the meal, still no manager. The waiter (Carl) was nice and did come around a few times to ask if everything tasted ok. After we were completely done eating, still no manager. Carl came to the table and stated the kitchen was \""backed up and having issues\"" he then stated the assistant manager was the only one working that day and he/she couldn't step out as he/she was assisting the kitchen in getting back on track. He then stated he was able to comp us ($11.00) and apologized for the service. \n\nAs we knew it was not the waiter's fault, we were extremely disappointed in the hour wait, no silverware, and no manager after requesting he/she twice. The cherry on top was the fact that the assistant manager essentially could not come out for a few minutes to speak with a dissatisfied customer. Extremely unprofessional."
425	1	a	"As chains go there is certainly a problem with the new location chosen for this franchise.  Should you wish to dine here on an evening or a Friday, Saturday or Sunday night, finding a parking space in the parking lot will be impossible  Apparently the Holiday Inn Express has commandeered the entire parking lot for their Hotel and the parking lot is \""empty\"".  As for the staff, other than letting me know that Holiday Inn will tow my car, there is no other help to dine at their franchise.  It is hard to sample the food when you have no way to park your car safely or within 600' or their door."
426	2	a	Best haircut I have ever received, Pittsburgh or otherwise.  Ryan obviously has a love for what he does and an eye for style.   All this and the price is right.  Walk-ins only,so you might have to wait for someone to finish, but that was not my experience.
427	1	a	I tried this location again. I really like the concept, but the execution is so bad. \n\nThere was no one ordering ahead of us and not too many people already seated when I got there early on a Sunday evening for four sandwiches to go. Given that I live less than 5 mins away, I went ahead and ordered the sandwiches hot. \n\nRookie mistake. If WW had a system where all sandwiches were ready at/near the same time, I could have made it home with four hot sandwiches. Place order, wait 7/10 mins and first order is called. Several minutes later two sandwiches go to a previously sat table. Several minutes later two more of my sandwiches. Long wait, two items to people who ordered after me. Then my last sandwich. So, 10 or more mins after my first sandwich, we received our last one. Of course, sandwich one is pretty much cold by then. \n\nI don't understand how their system is customer friendly. Even if you eat in, who wants to sit and stare at their food for 10 minutes while the rest of the table waits?  I have seen this all three visits. \n\nDone with Which Wich unless maybe I'm alone, starving and it's the only place around.
428	2	a	I was so happy that Passion8 relocated to Elizabeth. I finally get to experience the flavors for myself. The new location is sleek and minimal, with lots of wood. Our meal was terrific. Delicious oysters, charcuterie to start, with the fish of the day and quail for our mains.  All included wonderful combinations of interesting flavors. We will definitely make this one of our regular places.
429	2	a	This is probably the best toy store I've been - there is a large range of toys, however, it seems geared more toward adults and older children.\n\nThere are a lot of collectibles in locked cases and the best part, the huge wall of Funko Pop vinyl figures! These are adorable vinyl figures of popular television, movie, and real life characters that have been shrunk down and paired with disproportionally large heads. Prior to The Toy Box, I would purchase these vinyl figures on Amazon (if available). Although most of the prices are higher compared to Amazon, it's nice to see them in person and there are many figures that are hard to find online. They seem to range in price depending on their popularity, but they start around $10.\n\nThey have a nice Yelp check-in offer of 15% off one item, so don't forget to utilize it!
430	2	a	Good location for tempe marketplace. Far away from all the craziness and traffic aka much easier to get to than bevmo. Other than that it's your typical total wine. The second I walked in a staff member asked me if he could help me find something, and when they didn't have what I was looking for he redirected me to something similar. He knew what he was talking about, and even gave me a little lesson in champagne- Rose to be exact.
431	2	a	Lots of TVs to watch games. They have local beers, which is great! Lots of seating. Looks way better then the iguana Mack. Serves is alright not bad but not amazing. Chili atmosphere
432	1	a	Like the other reviewers, we have had a horrible time trying to make an appointment.  After complaining to Groupon, we were able to finally set an appointment.  What a surprise, they never showed up!    Maybe the common theme is, crappy service for Groupon customers?
433	2	a	Great new spot in the Bethany neighborhood. Great games and cocktails, like it's sister bar Little Woody's!
434	2	a	Love the location especially when the ice skating rink is up and running. Sitting on the patio is pretty chill watching all the people happily skating around. Every time I have come for happy hour drinks with or without snacks, there is some kind of hassle ordering-- can't find wine, or glasses or how to ring it up on cash register, but I keep coming back because it is  a relaxing place to hang out without a ton of creeps--- it is what is is and for the most part it is just fine.
435	1	a	Wait to go here. They do not have the ability to handle a Friday night. Had reservations for 730. Left at 815. Not once did a manager come out to explain or apologize. Hopefully they will figure it out.
436	2	a	Wanted to try a new spot and was recommended to try out Hearthstone by a friend. Great decor and energy. Especially loved the food! Must haves on the menu are the  Steak Tartare, Deviled eggs, Charred Octopus and the Charcuterie! Enjoy!
437	1	a	"Oh boy, where to start..  The wagyu beef burger - seriously, that is not.  It was a perfect copy of In-n-out. \n\nThree hours to get through dinner.  There is a big disconnect between the look of the place and the end result.  Needs a kitchen manager bad.  \n\nNot gonna be back. No way.  The staff was friendly, service was fair, but we waited a very long time for the \""American\"" styled tapas.  \n\nA few sparks of potential, but the team just could not pull it off. \n\nI lament spending $21 for an In-n-Out burger. When my wife leaned over and said; \""Nice cafeteria burger...\"" I knew this was not gonna end well, and it didn't. \n\nUgh."
438	1	a	"I was very excited about this restaurant opening in South Charlotte and done by local restaurant owners. It is billed as farm to table with local, fresh ingredients.\n\nThe interior of the restaurant is cozy and quite lovely with fireplaces and stone.  It's located in South Park.  \n\nTo be fair, we came on the first Friday they opened. Our server took forever to get us our wine and she didn't know at all what she was doing.  She struggled opening the bottle, and then she poured a rather pricey red way over volume in the first pour.  She had to be prompted to stop pouring -  to the point that we did not get 4 glasses out of the bottle because she poured so much in the first glass.  In terms of wine, they ran out of the first bottle we ordered so we switched our choice only to be told they were out of it.  They were also out of the next bottle we picked.  So, the owner came with a recommendation.  When I asked if it was a similar price point as my previous selection, I was told \""of course, we aren't THAT restaurant\"".  However, when he checked the wine, it was not the correct price point.  He did the right thing by us and discounted it a bit.\n\nWe ordered oysters as an appetizer and they were amazing.  Especially the gulf coast ones.  However, I asked for tabasco for them and was told they didn't have any.  Later, the waitress brought green tabasco but that's absolutely not the same. \n\nI ordered the arugula and walnut salad and it was perfectly prepared and tasty.\n\nThe entrees were a problem.  They were out of my first fish selection so I selected a fish on the menu but requested that they prepare it with an alternate to the fingerling potatoes.  I asked for more beets, a sweet potato instead - basically anything other than the potatoes.  The waitress told me they couldn't do that.  That made no sense to me since the menu had a listing of local farms they are patrons of.  Anyway, I decided on the shrimp and grits.  That was a really bad decision as the shrimp was overcooked, the grits were overcooked to a point of sticking together in a giant clump and the sauce was bland. I ate the shrimp (I was starving) and left the rest.  The owner asked me what I thought of the food and I politely told him it was \""ok\"".  That once again, he needed to have tabasco or some seasoning available (this was a white wine based sauce and didn't have sausage).  He didn't seem interested in my feedback.  On the positive note, my husband had the grouper and thought it was outstanding. \n\nThe owner returned with a piece of cheesecake that is his mother's recipe which my husband gobbled down quickly. However, he did not apologize for the experience, thank me for feedback or invite me to return.  I might consider returning but there are better choices in South Park."
439	1	a	Went here just to get a slice of peppermint pie since a friend posted a picture of it on facebook.\n\nThe service was super friendly and fast.  The pie was just okay though, I was really disappointed as I was looking forward to it.  Two slices of pie were small (though very rich) and the price was crazy expensive for to-go.  I believe $4.50 per small slice?\n\nI can't imagine I would ever go back...
440	1	a	I have to give Burger 21 only two stars for a couple of reasons. First, service. Despite there being at least 15 staff members, service was slow. My friends order came out 11 minutes before mine did. The owner clearly saw that we had been waiting a while for the second burger, but he just asked a staff member to check on it rather than find out himself. It wasn't busy as we went around 1:30 pm. Second reason I am disappointed was I ordered my burger without cheese. When my order finally came out, it was clear they scraped off the cheese. I could still see melted cheese on it that had been wiped off. It could have been they reused the same bun and toppings and made a new burger patty, hence the long wait...but either way there was cheese on part of it, then wiped off. I did inform the owner who apologized and gave me a $5 off coupon for my next visit. For a burger that was $8 without fries, this was somewhat insulting especially after he informed me the cook made a new burger. Either I was lying or he was. They offered to make me a new one but I wasn't wanting to wait another 15 minutes. After all was said and done, I ate less than about half the burger as it was very soggy and I was ready to just leave. The $5 coupon isn't enough incentive to get me to try it again. That's a shame as I was hoping it would be a great neighborhood joint like Fired Pie next door is.
441	1	a	First visit to Burger 21. Ordered the Burger 101 and onion strings to go. The onion strings were so heavily coated with salt I could not even eat them. The burger was very salty as well and did not finish it. Very disappointed and will not return.
442	1	a	"This is a typical B scale hotel lobby restaurant. Nothing special.\n\nAt lunch, they have a \""flatbread buffet\"". It sounded good, but since I was the only person that was eating lunch at the restaurant, the flatbread was over an hour old and dried up under the heat lamps. They were not going to put fresh out since I was the only customer.\n\nThe salad bar was ok, but VERY limited (14 items total)."
443	2	a	As a 20 year resident of Scottsdale, I remember this location being a pottery shop for the longest time.\n\nIt's nice to see them redevelop the building into a cozy Mexican restaurant.  The patio and outside bar are good areas to enjoy a meal when the weather is nice.\n\nThe prices are reasonable and I enjoyed my skirt steak rice bowl with stewed beans.  The flavors and the different sauces that you can add make for a nice option without the heavy sauces and cheese that come on dishes at most Mexican restaurants.\n\nOverall I enjoyed my experience here and plan to return.
444	2	a	First time tonight.  Loved it. Good food. Had the trio dip combo with the chips. The salsa bowl was delicious as were the other two dips which were. Avocado and quesa. Good service. Nice burrito and salads. Patio is great looking , fire coming out of the pedestals was a very classy touch.  Great outdoor furniture. We ate inside. Comfortable booth, well padded. And booth area was more quiet than the bar area which was very noisy. Awesome restrooms, great decor  good service. Great parking.  Should be a big hit. Is a little expensive compared to some simple Mexican places,  they also charged $5 for a salsa refill. Which is free at most Mex places.
445	2	a	Love this place! This new restaurant is set in a Spanish villa and has a fun and classy ambiance! There is a huge patio complete with small firepits and an outdoor bar.  There is plenty of parking available as well. \nThe menu is Tex-Mex. There are plenty of delicious vegetarian options. Everything is reasonably priced, and the food is delicious. Would DEFINITELY recommend the Calamari as a starter. This is probably one of the best versions of calamari I have ever had. The guacamole, salsa, and cheese are pretty good, not the best. The tacos are delicious!\nThey serve beer, wine, and cocktails. They have a very creative and interesting cocktail list. \nGreat ambiance, delicious food, great drinks, and reasonable pricing. I will definitely be back!!
446	1	a	Paying for chips and salsa at a Mexican restaurant is absolutely ridiculous, especially when nothing was that good. Maybe they charge because its in the heart of yuppy Myers Park. Tacos were at most ok. Margaritas were overpriced and not good. Service was ok. Don't waste your time with this place as there are way better Mexican places in Charlotte.
447	1	a	So after being seated, we asked the hostess what appetizers we could get pretty quickly and she named 2 and that was great. Once our waitress arrived we ordered drinks, the waitress brought us water and our drinks and came back for our orders a minute or two later. We ordered the calamari and 4 dishes. The calamari came first about 10 minutes later, then bread. The calamari was pretty disappointing, the calamari itself was kind of watery tasting. After we were almost done with the app, the waitress brought some bread and oil, which was very tasty - we had a few servings! Then came the salads. I personally really liked the salad and the house Italian dressing, but it is very Rosemary based, which some may not like.\n\nThen came our entrees. I got the scarpariello dish with a side of pasta - I really liked the sausage but the chicken was kind of meh. My friends had: bolognese, pesto, and puttanesca. It seems like the puttanesca was a win from the crowds reactions, but the others were also meh. It sounds fancy (naming) but I could've made the same thing at home easily. \n\nMy main complaint is the order of food. I've worked in an Italian restaurant before, you always bring the bread first! Especially if the waitress is busy the hostess should go grab some bread ASAP. Then salads, then apps, then entree. To be fair it seemed like the hostess was new. \n\nDoubtful I'd go again for $15/entree mediocre food and service.
448	1	a	"DO NOT BUY FROM HERE!!!!!!!!!! \n\nThe worst possible customer service I have ever received. \n\nSo, I was told to get an ecig from this place by someone who had recently bought one from them. Been looking to quit smoking and my husband wanted one too. \nSo, I went to the kiosk they have set up at AZ Mills Mall. I talked to the guy working there. We discussed what would work best for us and talked about prices. The one he was selling me was their most basic model. He told me they are normally $85 but would sell me 2 of them for $80. He said their juices are normally $10 but would sell me some for $5 each. And in the ecigs there is a heating element that needs to be replaced sometimes. I wanted to get a bunch of those since I have to send my husband his ecig overseas and wanted him to have plenty and not run out. So he told me since I was buying in bulk he would give them to me for $2.99 each instead of $5.99 each. \n\nI purchased the stuff, totaling out to $120.00. \n\nThe next day, I decided to check out their website to see if they had any different liquids there that they didn't have at the kiosk. I see my ecig I just purchased and clicked on it to see what other colors they had that they didn't have at the kiosk. AND TO MY SURPRISE, they were only $20 a piece on the website. Yes, you read that right. He charged me DOUBLE the price that they sell it for online. This is a LOCAL, SMALL company. I completely understand being able to purchase some things cheaper online and the convenience of being able to view, touch and check a product out in person. But DOUBLE the price????? The liquids are only $5 online and the heating elements are only $1.99. So, once again, got charged more and ripped off there too. \n\n*****Don't worry, the story gets better still*****\n\nSo, I call the kiosk number listed on my receipt. I ask to speak to a manager.  I get Frank on the phone and I tell him my situation. His response was (very rudely with tons of attitude in his voice) \""And what does that have to do with me?\"" Excuse me? You are the manager, same company, etc. He told me online you are buying wholesale and this is retail. Um. Bullshit. But ok. So I asked him if I should call the online customer support. Again, very, very rudely he replies \""You can do whatever you want.\"" WOW! I then proceeded to tell him how much he sucks at doing his job. \n\nSoooooo, I call the main phone number listed on the website. *Ring, ring....* \""Hello?\""  Yes, a company listing this number online for a business answers the phone Hello, not the company name. So I asked if this was Vapor Tech, he tells me yes. So, I proceed to tell him about being charged double, blah, blah. He explains that online, you don't get a lifetime warranty and at stores you do. So, I get charged double the price because I get a lifetime warranty? A lifetime warranty for a company that most likely won't be around that long, but ok. \n\nNow, here's the real kicker. So, online you can buy 2 of those ecigs for $40. But I paid that price for 1 because I get a lifetime warranty, right? WELL, the funny part is, if you try to use that lifetime warranty, there is a restocking fee of $19.99. So, for $60, I could buy 3 ecigs online, but instead, I get 1 at the kiosk for $40, then if it breaks I have that awesome lifetime warranty, but I have to pay $20 restocking fee???????????????? ARE YOU KIDDING ME? \n\nSo, continuing, this guy I'm talking to is the owner of the company. And then I tell him about his rude manager at the kiosk. Yeah, he doesn't give 2 shits. He tells me if I buy any liquids online to let him know and he'd throw a few bottles in there free for me. Yeah, I'm gonna go ahead and call BULLSHIT right now. If he wanted to resolve the situation, he would have asked for my address right then and shipped some stuff to me. \n\nHORRIBLE, SCAM, PRICE GOUGING, TERRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE!"
449	1	a	"I wanted to lovvvvve my stay here. I  booked 4 rooms with the most fantastic person in the world, the manager Louise, and everything went off without a hitch. The staff here is decent (except the shuttle bus driver...but I'll get to that). The hotel itself is clean and quiet for the most part, so if you're just looking for a place to sleep, you'll be happy. \n\nLet's start off with my least favorite person/people on the trip...The shuttle bus driver. The man does NOTHING all day. We were in a group of 8 and we asked for a shuttle ride 3 times and were denied 3 times. The first time, 2 people flew into the airport and needed a ride to the hotel, they called the hotel and they said that \""he didn't show up for work\"" but if they took a cab, they would be reimbursed. Well, that was nice and much appreciated by them. The second time we tried to utilize the shuttle was to take us to Hohokam, but the shuttle bus driver said he \""might be to busy to take us\"". Ummm, isn't that your job? I mean, to take people places. I was promised by the hotel that you would take us there...but you're too busy to do your job? That's cool...why don't you just keep sitting there eating breakfast ALL morning (I'll get to that...). The third time we needed to use the shuttle was to take 2 people to the airport the night that they were flying out. We called down to arrange and again were told that the driver didn't show up. Wow. Fire him! The whole 6 days we stayed there, I saw the shuttle van move one time. ONCE!!! \n\nNext up, breakfast. Anywhere in the Phoenix metro is going to be slam-jammed in March. Us baseball fans will pack your hotel, as a matter of face it will probably be at  100% capacity during March. If you offer breakfast, have enough food. Every single day, our hotel ran out of certain things. Little milk cartons, biscuits (they had gravy...the breakfast lady told me to use regular bread. haha. asshole), cinnamon rolls, bananas, pancake batter, sausage, bacon, eggs, etc. Those are just a few of the things they kept running out of while I was there for 6 days. One thing I noticed that the shuttle bus driver actually did well was (and probably what kept him SO busy) eat breakfast all morning. Yup, the same stuff that they were running out of, was being chowed down by the lazy ass bus driver. I can't stand a lazy person who just takes advantage of stuff. He's useless. \n\nThe pool at the hotel is small and doesn't look like it was cleaned in ages. I'm sure it was, but seriously I wouldn't even dip my toe in there, that's how disgusted I was. \n\nI booked 4 King rooms, but we only got 2 king rooms. The other two were queen rooms. Again, very disappointed that we all didn't get the rooms that were originally booked.  \n\nUmmm yeah... Sadly I won't be staying here again. Besides Louise, everything was a huge fail in my book."
450	2	a	first time here and we will be back.  We tried a bunch of tacos and they were all great.   The tortillas were fresh and just the right mix of soft and crispy.  I liked the cactus one the best.  They told us they will be adding more to the menu soon we we can't wait to back and try them too.
451	2	a	I had a great brunch with my 6 relatives here recently. The atmosphere was great. Parking was easy, back dirt lot, and the service was excellent. It was a bit more pricey than I thought it would've been but overall I had a great experience.  The traditional Mexican meals were good and their specialty drinks were excellent. Don't rack too many of those up though cause it's costly! I'm a fan.
452	2	a	Very satisfied customer so far. The food is great and the service is exceptional. Special thanks to the owner for my free tea!
453	2	a	Saw that this place opened up right across the street from my house and it was much needed.  We have a pizza hut, but there is nothing like coal oven pizza, it's the best.  I haven't had the pizza yet, but I have had their wings and OMG they are perfect.  I had the Italian style wings which are marinated over night (from what they told me) and they were cooked to perfection.  This is my new place for football and fun.
454	2	a	Yum!  They have huge rolls that are just delectable.  A bit pricey and I wasn't as impressed with the non-sushi entrees.  However, the sushi is awesome!\n\nI would recommend getting an appetizer and just jumping straight into the sushi heaven.
455	1	a	Service terrible - hostess was rude and took forever to get a waitress, the menu is not appropriate for children - many menu names X RATED. \nThe atmosphere is beautiful dark woods and reds. If they paid as much attention to their food and their customers as they did the decor, it would be a 10.
456	1	a	Well we went and tried it and not my favorite. I've been to many places in Las Vegas for sushi and this one did not hit its mark. Two things high prices that are not justified and service was so so. Never brought our edamame we ordered and put it on the bill. Rolls were extremely generic. Fake caterpillar roll had no flavor along with sex on the beach which tasted like rice vinegar that overpowered the whole roll. Salmon sashimi was not cut correctly, it was cut like the crab sticks which detracted from its presentation and flavor. Burning sensation roll with soft shell crab, avo, and tuna was swimming in a garlic ponzu and for some reason here was a heaping mound of rice on my plate. Overall not impressed and won't be back. Many other sushi places to try in Vegas for better food and service.
457	2	a	It might be my first check in but I've been here three times already. This time I brought my boyfriend with me.\n\nThey have a wide range of flavors when it comes to milktea, tea or snow bubble (my personal favorite). Lychee is usually my go to flavor but I have also tried their passion fruit which was delicious. They can also mix flavors for you like caramel thai tea snow bubble that my boyfriend asked for. \n\nThe staff is super friendly and easy to talk to. The price is very reasonable. You get a drink for under $5! \n\nOverall, this spot definitely satisfies my boba cravings:)
458	2	a	Great new local Italian spot in the neighborhood. We really enjoyed our dinner and the place looks great! We are giving them a -1 star for the service which was good but pretty slow. It's only their second day being open so I'm sure it will get better. Anyhow, the food and drinks were great. We shared the grilled octopus, the caprese 3 way, and the bolognese and finished with the chocolate dessert. Very yummy and we will be back!
459	1	a	I hate to be the odd man out but the previous revues must have been friends of the owner.  The Bolognese lacked flavor and the pasta was gummy and stuck together in a clump.  The Spiga salad advertised salami and pancetta\nAnd if there was one ounce of meat in it I could not find it.  My calamari was inedible and looked like it came from the frozen food case at Safeway. The dipping sauce with it was flavorless.\nOn the plus side the space is great with a good vibe.  If you go for vibe and space go, if you go for good food go somewhere else.  A generous 2 stars.\nAs usual North Scottsdale people confuse with flash with real quality cuisine. The I noticed that several great reviews that were the first ever in yelp, obviously planted by friends of the owner.  By the way the server agreed the calarmi  was terrible and removed it from my check
460	2	a	Great menu. Pasta was delicious. Pizza flavor was excellent but unfortunately crust became very soggy fast. Will definitely be back.
461	2	a	Stopped in and had their pad Thai along with some Thai tea. Everything was very good and very fresh. It's a little on the lighter side, which was refreshing. Their coconut ice cream is amazing. 10/10 for Thai food in the area.
462	2	a	Tried phuket Thai for the first time, my wife had the lunch special green curry, still ended up with enough leftover for another lunch.  I asked if they had any whole fish dishes, the owner made an off menu pompano fish in red curry.  The ginger tea and Thai coffee were tasty and we finished with homemade coconut ice cream.  Bring cash and save 10%.  Quantity and quality were good, service was a little slow.
463	1	a	This decision isn't one that I'm happy about. As a first time patron at the Culinary Dropout, I have to say, I will not be returning not because of the food (by the way, the food was OUTSTANDING) but because of the our waitress. On a Friday night, one could expect to have a delay in being seated, having orders taken...but to wait 45 minutes for your drink to arrive after already waiting 15 minutes for your waitress to acknowledge our table, is ridiculous! On top of waiting, a lady in our group asked for her drink three times, in which the waitress walked away twice while the request was being made....I mean who does that? Oh and by the way, never ONCE was I offered a refill on my Diet Coke during the 2+ hours of being there. \n\nNow on to the food, as stated above, the food is outstanding, however, due to our waitress not bringing our food out in a timely manner, my steak was cold. By this time, I had enough of the service issues and just wanted OUT. \n\nThe check arrives, and lone behold, it's wrong...waitress fixes the check, and proceeds to cash us out...our total bill for two is a little over $60, I hand the waitress a $100, and should have received $41.36 back in change....guess what, the waitress returns $41 and no change. So needless to say, your waitress should be thankful she kept the $.36 in change because that's $.35 more than what she was going to get from me. \n\nI honestly hope the Culinary Dropout reviews this and either contacts me for more information  before this waitress is allowed to ruin what could be an amazing experience for others.
464	2	a	This place is so much fun! I wish I could remember the name of our server, he was absolutely fantastic! I even forgot my dessert at the table and he chased us out the door to bring it to us! It was very busy but definitely fun to be able to play ping pong while we waited for our table! The only down side is that it is on the pricey side and as good as the food is, I'm not sure it's worth the amount we spent. Will probably go back for drinks and apps!
465	2	a	"I am so happy to have MTO Caf\u00e9 open in Downtown Summerlin.  It's a welcome addition to the neighborhood.  I stopped for lunch yesterday after some shopping and I'm glad to report it's as good as I had expected.\n\nI was greeted by the staff at the counter in a very friendly manner.  I was studying the large menu board above and two of the staff pointed to some smaller paper menus at the register.  I brought one of those home with me.  I selected the \""Philly\"" their take on the classic sandwich.  You're given a number to put on your table.\n\nThe menu describes it this way.  \""Skirt steak, Velveeta, red wine drunken onions.\""  The sandwich comes with fries.  I ordered a Coke and I was given a cup for use at their Coca-Cola Freestyle machine.  Silverware (real metal--not plastic) is available at the end of the counter by the registers and there are napkins, straws, and drink container opts there, too.\n\nI selected a table by the east windows that overlooks the Dining Arroyo.  There's a patio there with heaters and some people were sitting out enjoying their lunches.  In a short time, my lunch was brought.  The Philly is on a hamburger style bun instead of the traditional sub-like roll and there was a good amount of fries with the Philly.  \n\nThe small cubes of steak with the cheese and onions were excellent!  The fries were hot and very good.  \n\nAfter finishing while I was just answering some emails, a staff member came by and asked if she could remove the plate.  That gave me some work room on the table.  There is free wi-fi.\n\nI can't wait to go back and try some more things on the menu.  Welcome to the neighborhaood, MTO!"
466	2	a	The MTO cafe is another great addition to the dining choices at Downtown Summerlin. In door and patio dining are available. The indoor space is brightly lit and has comfortable seating. Ordering and payment is done at the counter and you are given a number to be placed on the table. Our order was taken by a friendly staff member and the food is delivered to the table. Refreshment are unlimited and self serve. Upon our arrival for lunch only one person was ahead of us but after sitting down the line grew to six people.\nFood preparation is not fast delivery food but made to order. After our food was delivered a staff member returned to check on our satisfaction.  \nTh Rueben sandwich was an ample size and comes with pickles on the side and skinny fries. The sandwich was juicy and tender. The special sauce is fantastic. A nice rye bread complements the sandwich.\nThe BLT sandwich was huge. Very tasty and half was taken home. This sandwich also comes with skinny fries that are soft inside, firm outside and not greasy.\nMTO serves breakfast, lunch and dinner. The menu has many choices that we look forward to experiencing on future visits.
467	2	a	Great store with good discounts on quality products.
468	1	a	I had RAIU done at Dobson Imaging earlier this week (Tuesday morning). The tech there said Chandler Endo would have my results by the end of the day. Today, *Friday*, Christine called at 1115 and left a message for me to call back before noon as the phones were being turned off for the weekend. I called at 1125 (which is, last I heard, before noon) and left a VM. And 1150. And 1155. 1156. 1157. 1158. Guess who never called me back.\n\nIf the practice is too busy to efficiently handle their patients, then they need to stop taking referrals and unf*ck their system. I'll be giving my GP an earful and demanding a referral to a different endocrinologist on Monday.\n\nEDIT, 10 July: Dr Belitsky somehow missed that my thyroid is 3x larger than normal, crammed full of nodules, and producing no, as in  less than 0.01mg/dL, TSH. This is beyond malpractice and into butt-monkey incompetence. I've since transferred to Endocrinology Associates, who (whom?) I'll be reviewing later.
469	2	a	Had the grilled pork and also shewn beef sandwiches.... This restaurant has a great atmosphere, fantastic food and great service! Awesome new addition. I will be eating here often. Come try it out.
470	1	a	Terrible bloody mary that took ten minutes to get. Service was slow, watched manager come out and apologize multiple times to dissatisfied customers.  Food was mediocre at best.   Beautiful building and decor is the only thing this place has to offer.
471	1	a	We went there a couple of days ago for dinner. The place was fairly busy but we got a nice table soon enough. \nThe ambience and the food presentation was great, however, the service was not good at all. They also took a really long time to prepare our food and then brought out the appetizers and entrees together!! The food tasted alright, however, was not worth the wait.
472	2	a	Consistently adding value to already invaluable services. I am always surprised to see something new and awesome added.
473	2	a	BEE-ARR-GEE-ARR has revolutionary gourmet burgers. \nAbout 20 beers on tap.\nCocktails.\nHandmade shakes and more.\nOrdered the Button Buster with braised beef short ribs, white cheddar, bearnaise ailol, onion rings.  Tasty and nice combo of flavors.  Had the BRGR fries tossed with parmesan + herbs.  Nice tasty and firm fries.  Tried some of the fries with the mayo based BRGR condiment, just like they do in many European countries and found that to be an interesting, too!\n\nThe manager was stopping at all the tables to check on how everything was.  \n\nIt's good to have BRGR in the area.
474	1	a	Wanting to try the new place, we went around noon on a Sunday, place was less than half full, so no waiting.  We ordered and our burgers came surprisingly quickly.  You would think they would be piping hot.  But, no, they were just warm.  Had they been pre-cooked?  It was curious.  We ordered the Cajun tots and an order of fries.  The burgers were pretty tasteless, not juicy, which only added to our thoughts that they may have been pre-cooked.  Fries were nothing special and the tots on top had a sprinkling of spices, not enough to earn the Cajun label and very little spice flavor other than the ones on top.  Personally, I think that if you are at the Galleria and want a burger, the burgers at Houlihans are better.  Also, and this may seem petty, but I hate being served on plastic plates with the paper on the plate.  We won't bother going back, we felt the same way about the BRGR in East Liberty.  Too bad, I was hoping for a success at that location, it has been through a few iterations of restaurants.
475	1	a	The customer service here is not that bad. The coffee on the other hand is lacking in quality. Actually, it's some of the worst coffee I've ever had. Some of the sandwich options are tolerable , but it's a coffee shop... and the coffee is awful. Also,  there is a fee to use your card if under 5 dollars. Pfft
476	2	a	Menu is a tex-mex hybrid featuring unique takes on nachos and Mexican fare.\n\nShared the bbq chicken nachos with the husband. The bbq flavor has a great sweet and savory combo with a slight chili powder dimension that is great to eat! The black beans, corn and white cheese go well with the succulent chicken. Although it was a great change to traditional nachos, we did miss the sour cream and guac you expect to find with nachos.\n\nWe will more than likely head back to another one of the Nacho Daddy locations.
477	2	a	I love this place. So suprised that there are any negative reviews. Weather is cold now and this place has great comfort food. Friendly staff and a nice atmosphere. My family and I eat here at least once a week.
478	2	a	What a welcome addition to the neighborhood full of yummy food choices!  There are so many options, each burger is as original as you!   If you are up to the challenge, may I suggest their 20oz burger!   With a mountain of fresh toppings, each bite is a new experience!  If you finish it and the fries......you become a legend on their wall of fame.  Over 50 ingredients to create the perfect shake, you just can't go wrong here!    Bring an appetite and perhaps a bib, you won't be disappointed!
479	2	a	Amazing burger, amazing shakes would recommend. Also pretty decent service I will be back
480	1	a	"Oh where to begin...  When we first arrived we were seated quickly in a too tight dining area.  My husbands chair was up against another customers chair.  There is no way to maneuver to get to your table so forget getting up to go to the bathroom because you will disrupt the diners around you.  We started w/3 waters with lemon.  Our server brought the waters .... no lemon.  We had to remind him twice to bring the lemon.   \n\nThe 1/3lb burger is tiny at best, the meat is about the size of a slider but the bun is a regular size burger bun.   A Mcdonald's cheeseburger from their dollar menu is bigger.   So I ordered a classic burger w/mayo/let/mushrooms cooked medium, My daughter had a classic burger cooked medium well w/mayo/let  only.  My husband ordered the pounder and he ordered the \""best of both\"" with fries and onion rings.   My daughter and I opted to share a med. fries only.   \n\nMy burger arrived w/no mushrooms, my daughter's burger was blood rare and we did not get the fries we ordered.  The \""best of both\"" was mediocre at best.  The breading used on the onion rings has no flavor and tastes blah so they probably only use flour on them without any type of  seasonings.  My husbands fries were heavily coated w/pepper and appeared old so he didn't even eat them.  \n\nI did send both mine and my daughters burger back to be fixed.   It took a while for the food to be returned, I also did inquire about the missing order of fries.  The server said \""oh sorry\"" I guess I forgot to order them.   So about 15 mins. later and my daughter and I had finished our mini me burgers, we received fresh hot fries that had not been seasoned at all which was probably a good thing because at least they were edible, but again nothing special.    So all in all I would not recommend this place to anyone!!  It's also kind of pricey.   I received better service and tastier food at Smash burger and it's only a block further.   I will travel the extra block.   \n\nThis place may do better on the strip especially considering their higher prices and visitors would probably flock to it's doors not knowing any better.  But as local, it's definitely worth my time to drive somewhere where I will get better service and food for my money!!"
481	2	a	So we have been driving by the one on Rainbow in southwest for about a year now and saw this newly opened gem while we were getting our pictures taken near by. While we waited for the pictures to print, we decided to try this place. The food was pretty good and the service was fantastic. Definitely  worth a visit.
482	1	a	The food was good be service was very slow. We ordered a shake waited 15 mins before we learned the main ingredient was out of stock. Our food made it to the table still no shake since we changed the shake order. A table was sat near us was never greeted got tired of waiting they left without eating at all. At the end we sat just waiting to pay so we could leave over all not a good experience may not go back.
483	1	a	1. Decor of a 50's diner. \n2.  Riff raff clientele \n3. Took forever to get waited on. \n4. Another eon to get the food. \n5. Young portly tattooed waiter obviously didn't know what he was doing. \n6. Salad ordered by my wife.  How can you screw up a salad?  Well, some lettuce leaves had brown spots, that's how. \n7. Sweet potato fries had been sitting for awhile before being served, kinda soggy. \n8. Make up your own burger.  So I did, so maybe it was my fault it tasted like some fool had put it together. \n9.  Is there a minus star rating?
484	1	a	Watered down milkshakes, the place smells like the nail salon next door, Egg Cream was EXTREMELY small along with too much soda. Liked the fry seasoning but they were under cooked.  Long wait time for our food. Given the burger competition on Eastern Ave., the space will be vacant by Summer.
485	2	a	My second time here and the food is very consistent. .the prices are great the service is wonderful and the staff is very friendly. .must stop in
486	1	a	"Went to the outlet mall in search of a cafe that was nowhere to be found. One of the mall's finest recommended Steak and Fries and raved about it. I guess you can't blame a guy for talking up the very place he is paid to protect, but this place was not good. At best it was fast food quality at restaurant prices in a food court. \n\nThey were not busy by any stretch, but had six cackling employees behind the counter carrying on like geese in heat. Their mating calls could be heard echoing throughout the food court. \n\nThe food took too long and my bacon cheeseburger was just \""middle of the road.\"" The fries were decent, but only warm. I was expecting hot, fresh fries. No such luck. Lunch for two was thirty bucks! There were a few other options inside the food court but you might be better off leaving the property for lunch if this place is any indication of how the other eateries are.\n\nOnly two stars this go round. The service, food quality and price all combined to make this a disappointing experience."
487	1	a	Dang I wish I knew this was on Yelp. I would save the time and money.\nI am a hardcore JFK fan. my license plate is JFK! and boy was I disappointed.\nEverything is a replica, items are scattered in a huge meeting/ event room, it looks so amateurish I felt like it was disrespectful to the 35th president. \nEven if it was free admission I'd still be disappointed and upset. \nI could have done a better job doing it in my living room. \nShame on you Tropicana!
488	1	a	I've been wanting to come here for quite some time now after seeing it featured on Guy Fieri's Diners, Drive ins, and Dives.  The star of the show was the oxtail chili cheese fries.  Which on the show, looked amazing.  The chili cheese fries were made with copious amounts of oxtail and was a meal in itself.   I remember marking my notes with not only the location but what to order (oxtail chili cheese fries) and the cost $8.99.      As usual,  after Guy leaves,  things change.  The chili cheese fries didn't have a morsel of oxtail.  I found a few hair strand like pieces in the chili but that was it.  To make matters worse, the price had been increased to $11.  That's the same price as a burger!
489	2	a	I expected this location to be similar to the one in PHX: underwhelming and overpriced. However!!! I experienced something much better.  It just seems a bit more quant..put together..and a place that encourages interaction between  guests and invites you to truly enjoy yourself.Maybe its just the new place...the layout (additional bar outside) or the low key yet swanky atmosphere....\nI'm not totally sure. This place deserves the hype.
490	2	a	"Salvatore's is HERE IN MADISON! Woohoo, the Yelp favorite pizza is here!! Let's cheer! No more driving to Sun Prairie for Salvatores!\n\nI was surprised by the size of Salvatore's, maybe 8 tables or so, and the bar area is small. So, I was really thankful to visit on a weekday, when I didn't need to wait for seats, and food didn't take too long to arrive. If you're lost, it's right next to Johnson Public House, and have pizza board with skulls saying Wisco on them (So hipster :p)!\n\nThe menu has great selections - lots of appetizers, make your own pizza, specialty pizza and tacos!!! Pretty excited about all these things. Also, there's a good selection of beer and non-alcoholic drinks. \n\nI loved the carbonara pizza - eggs, bacon, cheese. my FAVORITE THINGS. AND, how is it possible that ALL 3 eggs were RUNNY. Such an amazing creamy, rich flavor with runny yolks! The crust of the pizza is thin crust, though not italian thin, but has great chew to it. (P.S. the ~8\""/$14 pizza was so big, we had some leftovers; the leftovers were AMAZING. just heat them up in the oven. oooohhhhh good)\n\nWe also tried the bacon and cheese bread (even though it was similar to our pizza..), the sriracha sauce added some much flavor and depth! LOVE IT. \n\nDefinitely gonna be visiting very soon again! How about some delivery very soon??? Please? :D"
491	2	a	This was my first Yelp Elite event and my first chance to meet Risa, as well as some other great people! What a warm, lively, fun, creative and delicious way to spend a chilly Sunday night! \nI'm going to try to write this review without using too many exclamation marks, but that'll be a challenge. \nDanielle, the glowing hostess, was on fire in the kitchen! I mean, she whipped up individual stir fry plates for every single guest (and there were a lot of us), hot and beautifully presented. And, THOSE PEANUTS. Seriously - I don't even really like peanuts but I was even grabbing a handful on my way out the door despite being already painfully full. Where were they from again?? Also, it'd been a while (like many, many years) since I'd had tempeh, and I now feel like I've been missing out! I'm definitely going to go back to check out Noble Bean, our tempeh supplier for the night, housed just upstairs from Cuisine Culinaire. Who knew?! Now we do. \nInstead of waiting in line for stir fry, I decided to go to dessert first and sample some of the cookies brought in for the swap... and really didn't even know where to begin with those... There were sooooo many good cookies and such a variety. Thankfully I had my partner with me so that I could just take a bite of one to sample it and hand off the rest to him to finish for me. Ha! Cookies for days. What a FABULOUS idea to have a cookie swap. Everybody got to leave with something. :)\nNow, Cuisine Culinaire is one of over a thousand community kitchens in Quebec, so we were told, and this blows my mind! Quebec wins! It's really good to know about this place, and I hope they have a website, because it would be awesome to go back for a cooking class sometime!
492	2	a	I'm in love with this adorable little shop! It's PERFECT! Something for everyone, you'll never leave empty-handed! The owners are warm and friendly and so helpful!
493	2	a	'Twas the week before Christmas and all through the QC, Yelpers were celebrating - more American Mules for you and for me!\n\nThank you IOS for hosting such an awesome Yelp holiday party! Nikki W has done it again! Thank you to Poprock for catching really fun moments, your pictures always depict the fun environment perfectly! (#alloftheexclamationmarks)\n\nThis was such a fun event!  I completely fell in love with the American Mule cocktail, and the punch was delicious too. The food line was long, but worth it. Everything was made just right, and the lamb was so tasty. Perfect little selection of hummus, meat and extras. I didn't know that IOS existed Uptown, but I'll be sure to add it to my list of Uptown food options.  I loved getting to chat with Yelpers that I hadn't met before and catch up with the regulars.  \n\nAnd cheers to the Smores bar!! (Thank you again to Poprock for not catching me shoving the whole marshmallow in my mouth...)\n\nHappy Holidays all!!  Lookout, 2015!
494	1	a	This place was just okay for me. It was nothing spectacular and there weren't fireworks on my tongue haha I have gone to the one in central park in new york and I remember that one being real good. So, I was very excited when I heard one had opened here! \n\nWhen I looked at the menu, it was similar to that of new york. The average price of a burger is 6-10$. The shakes are around 5$. When I had arrived, I was expecting some what of a line but I seriously just walked right on up to the register and ordered our burgers. Some of the burgers have a shack sauce that reminded me of in n out, but this sauce is much saltier than I remember. Nothing beats the in n out secret sauce  \n\nOverall, the burgers we got basically tasted like something  that I could have concocted at home. Just cook some meat, fry some bacon, melt some cheese and voila! You have a shake shack burger. The sauce was salty and I felt it had overpowered the taste of my burger. I had to drink two cups of Dr pepper to help with it. The krinkle fries were good tho! You can't mess up potatoes! Oh, my friend got a strawberry milkshake that was OK too. \n\nI wasn't too impressed so I may only return to see if my first experience was just bad or if a friend forces me.
495	1	a	"Extremely disappointing and frustrating experience.  Highlights:\n\n- $10 unexpected parking fee \n\n- Before we entered we were told by staff that food or drinks were not allowed on the premises, \""No exceptions.\"" I learned that, actually, both were allowed, but only if you paid for them inside. When we did purchase food and drinks ($40 worth), we were never advised that we could not proceed into other domes with said food and drinks.\u00a0 At dome 3, the staff told us we had to throw away everything,\u00a0 which included the souvenir cups, before we could proceed (it's worth noting the concession stand is RIGHT NEXT TO dome 3). \n\n- The work I put in to pre register for the event (a laborious task due to a poor Web experience) was useless because the kiosks to activate/link profiles to your provided band didn't work. Also, I learned from a manager that the wristbands that were sent to AZ were not the ones they originally tested the experience with.  The wristbands did not work at all,\u00a0 and they we're eventually taken away from us by staff outside the level 3 dome because \""they're vey defective,\"" as one employee told me. \n\n- Staff activated each interactive game with random bands (I guess some actually worked?)...But this seemed to cause issues with the sensors that read body height; all but one of the games functioned poorly.\n\n- None of the 3D features worked,\u00a0 and we were told they would not work until Tuesday (3 days after our purchased event date). Very upsetting considering 3D features were advertised as part of the Marvel Experience. \n\n- Waiting times to enter domes were extreme (it took our group 40 minutes to enter the the Level 3 dome because the staff said they were fixing technical issues). Another 30 min for the 4D. Btw, why was it considered 4D if I'm watching a 1D movie on a big screen (no 3D glasses here), while sitting on a motion seat? \n\n- At the end of the event,\u00a0 I was asked by a staff member how was my experience.\u00a0 I gave my candid feedback and his reply literally was,\u00a0 \""Well, at least you didn't pay $180 bucks per ticket like some other people.\"" Because...that's supposed to make me feel better? \n\n- Sidebar: Is it just me or did I not see one piece of merchandise in the shop that featured a female character (even though they were featured in the videos throughout the experience). Male characters only for sale. That doesn't seem very balanced.\n\n- Further frustrated,  I asked who is on site to manage the whole experience.  I was told it depends... There's someone managing VIP, food, tickets,  and technology.  I asked for anyone who can make changes.  Strangely,  they send me to the ticketing manager.  When I provided my feedback I learned: no one really knows who or to what extent staff was trained (some staff admitted to me they hadn't been thru the experience), the wrong bands were sent to AZ, there isn't time for anything to fix things because \""we go from 9 am to 11 pm everyday and there's no time to figure anything out,\"" AZ was more of a \""test ground,\"" and the 3D won't be fixed until Tuesday,  after someone is flown in to fix it. \n\n- If you want a refund (I'm sure you will), I learned you have to request it through TicketMaster.\n\nBoo."
496	1	a	If I could give 0...I would.  Don't do it.
497	2	a	Items Selected:\nChocolate Cinnamon Horn\nSmall Cinnamon Crunch Cronut\nBlueberry Fritter\nBlueberry Frosted Cake\nApple Cinnamon Bear Claw\nCinnamon Crunch Hole, Glazed Hole, Powdered Sugar Hole\n\nA new year and a new favorite, the second of back-to-back weeks at Ace Donuts again showed the high quality of the new bakery's goods and this time opting for items not available on my first visit it was a truly excellent quintet that kicked of 2015 - the soft ring beneath blueberry frosting eating more like butter-cake than a doughnut while the fritter and cronut again shined despite selecting smaller versions and different constituents.  More than enough to share, but so good that one may not want to, it was largely due to my early hour of arrival that the Jumbo Bear Claw stuffed with ample amounts of cinnamon apples outshined any similar pastry in the city and although the combination of rich chocolate and substantial notes of cinnamon may not appeal to every palate the crispy exterior and soft insides of the gnarly horn was a veritable cornucopia of flavor, the warm delivery making the aromatics even more impactful and the chocolate just messy enough to justify the use of a fork and knife.\n\nUndoubtedly the best all-around doughnuttery in Las Vegas - Artisan, Old School, or Otherwise.
498	1	a	Expensive lunch meals.  Fried pickles were good.  Waitress messed up 2 orders out of 4.  Don't think I'll return.  Asked for no cheese waitress joked extra cheese, then brought my meal with cheese.  Better places to eat in area.
499	1	a	Highly overpriced and food was cold. Our waitress seemed confused and didn't know the menu. She had no idea about gluten free. The gluten free bun was awful.
500	1	a	"I have been using this company for 11 months.  Ryan would come out every other week and do what he needed to be done. Very little was required as I have desert landscaping and pretty much maintained it myself.  Just needed blowing and general light cleanup.  Ryan was very thorough.\nThen his brother, I believe, would  come out.  I would have to watch him as if I was not looking, it would be a pretty much \""hit and run\"" literally.\nI was expecting them Friday.  No show, no call as they never call when they cannot make it.  I have to call them and ask where they are or if they are coming.   Finally a text back saying they will be there Monday as they are running late.\n\nMonday comes and again no call no show.  I texted them...no answer...I was very upset at this point as I asked if they would trim a tree that is coming into my yard from a neighbor.  Mind you, there is very little to do here...no grass...no weeds..no plants to constantly trim.  I felt that I asked them to trim a tree and they could not be bothered.\n\nI am extremely disappointed in this company as they start out fine and as it continues, they seem to take their customer's for granted.  NO COMMUNICATION...NOT EVEN A CALL WHEN THEY CANNOT COME.   \n\nSORRY RYAN, I WILL TAKE MY BUSINESS ELSEWHERE.  AS A BUSINESS OWNER, YOU SHOULD KNOW BETTER!!!!"
