0	0	a	We came in here for a good late night meal. But they were so slow getting us seated and serving food. We waited a total of 1.5 hours to get seated and another 1.5 to get our food. Waiters are so worried about their cellphones and each other. They just gather around and talk. They do not care at all if the food is being served or not. Despite many waiters sitting around, foods are not being served. Horrible place to dine at...
1	1	a	Best Sushi in Scottsdale the fish was fresh. Service was great.  Best sashimi in Arizona.
2	1	a	"Sushi J is a great local sushi spot in old town Scottsdale. Definitely not your 'see & be seen' overrated & overpriced Ra or terrible service of Stingray. Locally owned, Chef J is knowledgeable & takes great care in creating an experience you want to come back for. The salmon skin roll is one of the best I've ever had & the yellowtail sushi was fresh & well portioned. The Lord of Tuna roll with thin slices of lemon, plus \""fresh\"" wasabi was incredible!\n\nThe portions are generous & the pricing fair. They have great \""Happy Day\"" specials...all day specials vs just a happy 'hour.'\n\nMaggie was awesome & so personable on the phone we had to come in for he 4th of July to celebrate with them! Tina was wonderful as well & as a team their service was delightful.\n\nIf you're looking for your neighborhood sushi spot in old town Scottsdale that's perfect connecting & enjoying sushi with people who want you coming back, this is the place to be!"
3	1	a	"New place, nice people and good service.\n\nI had the salmon and tuna sashimi and got good large pieces.  Great value and really fresh fish.\n\nThey have some interesting \""low carb\"" rolls and I tried the Marilyn Monroll based on the server recommendation but I think I will try the Friday night fever roll next time.  \n\nLastly I had the Geisha roll with siracha on the side which was a perfect addition!\n\nI will certainly return when I'm back in town!"
4	1	a	We've been back several times.  Service has been great and sushi has been very adequate.  I'm a sucker for yellowtail sashimi and it has been delectable.  We also enjoyed the specialty rolls which I typically avoid but must admit the Marilyn MonRoll and cucumber rolls we awesome.  \n\nAlso they have been giving 30% discount for grand opening and that has made it the best deal I'm town. \n\nI'd say it's better that the sushi ra and stingray BS while not at Roku Akor, Shinbay calibre but it's not nearly as expensive
5	1	a	I like sushi at least a couple times a month and have lived near old town almost 10 years.  RA, Geisha, Kyoto, Stingray (when it was open), are all places I've been countless times.  \n\nI think this will be my new spot if I am going out primarily for the food.  The service is really good and the food quality is great and it's one of the more authentic Japanese restaurants in the area (actual Japanese people work here which is rare in Scottsdale).  We loved the Udon soup - the broth was excellent.  I hope some day to see Ramen on the menu.  Also, the sashimi salad was really good and tons of Sashinmi and all fresh.   \n\nPros:\nmostly Japanese staff that are attentive and good service\nGreat parking - next to Sprouts parking plaza; always can park right out front\nCool atmosphere - I like that it's not too small and not too big\nNice menu and what I've eaten so far - delicious and fresh
6	1	a	Good sushi at a good price. The stuffed jalape\u00f1o appetizer and the crunchy bay roll were awesome! We called and made a reservation which was probably good since the restaurant is a little smaller.
7	1	a	You know the sushi is great when you can't wait to get home to write a 5 star review! My friend and I sat at the sushi bar. We were pleasantly surprised to learn that J, the owner, makes the sushi. Every roll we watched him make looked like a piece of art! J has talent!\n\nI ordered a bowl of edamame (steamed or nuked perfectly), the happy hour Las Vegas roll and the Alaska roll. That was by far the best Vegas roll I've ever had. The salmon and crab meat were soooo fresh! The Alaska roll was good, but I probably won't order it again with so many other choices.\n\nMy friend had the Candy Cane and Superman rolls. She liked the Candy Cane roll so much that she ordered a second one. The service was excellent- almost a little TOO good because the wait staff kept standing behind us in anticipation of our last bite to remove our plates (were they short on dishes?). I hadn't even started chewing my last piece when he reached to take my plate. I almost choked on my food as I tried to ask him to leave my plate so I could save the sauce for my second roll. \n\nI loved our experience at Sushi J so much that I returned the following night to try the Candy Cane roll. My new fav roll AND my new fav sushi restaurant.\n\nI highly recommend you try Sushi J!
8	1	a	Hands down the best sushi in Scottsdale!  No need to ever go to Stingray again!  Especially since it is walking distance from my home!
9	1	a	Made a new chef friend and he insisted I try uni his way... topped with salmon roe rather than massago. \nChef J's way wins!  I've been missing out... The salmon roe is saltier and a waaaaay better compliment to uni!  \n\nAlso, have you ever been able to taste the sushi vinegar used in making the sushi rice? Me neither! I don't use soy, nor wasabi, and only taste pickled ginger between bites to cleanse the palate; yet I've never detected that flavor until tonight. And tonight, fish+rice=simply amazing!\n\nVery reasonably priced to boot!
10	1	a	I got extremely excited when I saw that Sushi J was opening as I live less than a mile away and am always looking for new sushi restaurants. I went in with low expectations because the old sushi restaurant that used to be there was pretty mediocre, but I was quickly blown away by my very first bite!\n\nI came with a friend and we sat at the bar and started to chat with J the owner and head sushi chef. I put our order in his hands and he served us Suzuki (sea bass), Hamachi belly (yellow tail belly), and Big Eye tuna nigiri. Each piece was absolutely delicious. This was the first time I had Suzuki and it was so flavorful and went perfectly with the ponzu he brushed it with. Yellow tail belly was served slightly torched, and was rich and melted in my mouth. Fish pieces were very generous and were in perfect proportion to the rice. Rice was also perfectly seasoned (I am very picky about my sushi rice!) Then we ordered the Lord of Tuna roll which was wonderful and had an interesting twist with some mango included inside. Loved the tuna tataki served on top of the roll. \n\nI had accidentally left my credit card there and decided that it was a good enough excuse to come back the very next day.......for yet another sushi dinner! This time I ordered the Fire in the Mouth roll - spicy tuna inside topped with hamachi and jalapeno. I loved how spicy it was, and the combo of tuna and hamachi. I also ordered the scallop nigiri (one of my very favorites) and it was wonderfully flavorful and fresh. I also ordered some hamachi and salmon pieces, again very large, fresh cuts that melted in my mouth.\n\nService was excellent, and it was great to be able to talk to J and watch him make his beautiful creations. Freshest fish I've found in Scottsdale so far. Only thing that would make this place better in my mind is if the atmosphere were a bit more lively or trendy. But still, 5 stars!
11	0	a	"Presentation was good, but the quality of the fish wasn't there and the prices were pretty high too, $8 for a spicy tuna and all specialty rolls were more than $12.  The \""deal\"" rolls are the same price per piece as the regular rolls, just less pieces.  Even with the 15% discount because they just opened I was still disappointed.  Overall I probably won't go back."
12	1	a	A couple of my Sushi peeps were bragging about this place and I had an opportunity to check it out.  I'm so glad they talked it up, it was very good.  Service was a little slow but I'm going to chalk that up to culteral differences since I was having a power lunch and my server was trying to keep it casual.  We tried three rolls, Philly, Spicy Tuna, and THE roll (in house specialty).  They were all thick rolls, almost to the point of being too thick, but very very good.  The Miso soup and salad were great starters as we waited for our rolls to be prepared.  Both my friend and I will be returning to enjoy this resturant again as well as my other friends!
13	1	a	Wife and I looking for sushi after 10 months of pregnancy and banned from anything raw we reluctantly ventured out with our five day old and found sushi j just around the corner from where we live.  I work in San Francisco and have traveled quite a bit dining at some of the best sushi restaurants in the country so know quality fish when I see and taste it. I highly recommend sushi j!!!  We had the sashimi combo which featured yellowtail, salmon, albacore, and tuna. The portions were huge and the fish extremely fresh. Some of the best I've had and definitely the best ive had in phoenix. Also had the spicy tuna handroll and a special roll simply called THE roll.  Staff very friendly and prices are reasonable. Excited about quality sushi in my hood!!!!
14	0	a	Came here for lunch and was unimpressed. The waitress brought us soup and salad as soon as we sat down and then was gone for like 10 minutes. No drinks. I did not try any sushi, so it could be spectacular for all I know. I had the lunch portion of Teriyaki beef, which was a good portion, but the meat was really tough. I did like the sauce, though.\n\nWe also ordered gyoza, which I liked, but the dipping sauce was off. My bf ordered the Tempura lunch, which was a good portion but again, the dipping sauce was off. \n\nProbably would not rush back here, but I am always willing to try something more than once, because you never know!
15	1	a	"I'm giving this place 4 stars, it won't let me do 4.5 and I'm not sure they deserve 5.\nThe food was good. I ordered the \""Samurai\"" roll and the \""Philadelphia\"" roll. The samurai was a new one on me completely and the Philly is an old standby that's pretty standard at all sushi places. That being said, the service was great. Waitress made us nervous though when she took out order and the table next to us order, and did not write anything down. She did get the orders right however which was grand! My wife's food took a little extra wait to show up, which over all wasn't a big deal. At the end of the meal they gave us complementary green tea ice cream for the wait. Completely awesome surprise. The samurai roll as mentioned was something I've never had before, it's main ingredient is spicy tuna ( one of my favs ) this roll was great! Not too spicy, and a fantastic variety of textures and flavors. \nThe Philly roll however left something to be desired. All the standard ingredients are there, salmon, avocado, and cream cheese. What made this Philly roll different? I think they used a fat free or lite cream cheese, which is great for health conscious people. And one I normally wouldn't mind, except fat free cream cheese has a different texture than regular cream cheese. So the whole roll felt different, the taste was there, but the texture was off which was disappointing. \nBut the great service and nice atmosphere will for sure get me back into this restaurant however I probably won't be ordering the Philly roll again. \nIf you are a fan of good sushi and great service, this is the place to go!"
16	1	a	Prompt service is the first thing that comes to me. I walked in alone and was instantly greeted when I walked in , the ambiance is a little dark and dingy, but the delightful staff makes up for the lack of decor. My order was very straightforward , spicy tuna roll, and miso soup. Two staples that I think put a restaurant to the test, and I think they passed with flying colors. Fresh ingredients, substantial portions, frequent water refills, and happy staff.
17	1	a	Wow!...what a treat it was to eat here this evening ...very fresh...great\nservice...nicely decorated...fairly priced...can't ask for more...
18	0	a	"I really don't understand the high ratings. One of the reviews below states, \""You can rate a sushi restaurant by their miso soup and they sure pass!!\"" REALLY?? It's like saying \""you can rate a steak house by how good their steamed broccoli is.\"" WHAT?? This person is obviously clueless.\n\nThe only thing this restaurant has going for them, aside from these deceptive reviews, is nice people. I have never spoken with the owner, but he seems like a nice guy.\n\nI have been here three times now, ordering different things, hoping to like it since this place is just around the corner from me. The food is just not acceptable.\n\nMiso Soup: Gross and super salty (coming from somehow who likes salty things).\nSalad: They use a spring mix...it came really, really, wet and tasteless. \nTempura Udon Soup: Tempura tasted like it was fried in old oil.\nSushi/Sashimi: Yes, large portions, but the quality of the fish is not good.\nAgedashi Tofu: Again, tasted like it was fried in old oil.\n\nI ordered their hand rolls today and couldn't even finish it because they were no good. i left still hungry. \n\nThe owner and the employees should take a moment to eat what they are serving. I don't plan on going back."
19	1	a	Being that I travel for a living and my overwhelming enjoyment of prerty much all things sushi, I like to try as many places as possible when it comes to sushi bars. This one is amongst the best and is my favorite!  Not exactly cheap mind you. For the best deals come in Sunday through Thursday and select from the Happy Day rolls.
20	1	a	I don't get on Yelp to rip people, especially when most people do usually after only trying a place once but when they are good I definitely like to let people know.... I'll keep it simple , all the staff were great, totally friendly and did an awesome job. As for the Sushi, I'm not a pro but tasted very fresh and thoroughly enjoyed it.. we tried several different rolls and all were very good..... I think one was called the Fire Mouth and  they were delicious .... Want good sushi and service, check it out
21	1	a	"We came here on a very high recommendation from a friend who owns THE top restaurants in Scottsdale (Posh!) and Sushi J kicked ass.  I value freshness, presentation and a chef that knows how to bring out the flavors in the fish.  Everything was spot-on and I heavily recommend it if you're a fan of sashimi and nigiri.  It doesn't have the \""ooontz ooontz ooontz\"" of most other sushi joints trying to moonlight as a dance club, which is a HUGE plus.  Sushi should be about the fish, the chef and preparation.  And Sushi J is."
22	0	a	I am extremely disappointed with my experience at Sushi J last night. \nWe were seated right away, the bus boy was kind and took our drink orders and after a while our waitress followed. She took the orders of half our table and put her book away, thanked us for our order and I reminded her that I still needed to order. \nWe waited. And we waited. Finally the first of our order came out and we waited some more. It's fine that it came out a little at a time but the wait in between each was very long. I watched as people who arrived after us received full orders while I was still waiting. After 30 minutes of waiting for my last roll to arrive, I wasn't hungry anymore and wanted to cancel the last roll. Everyone around me had finished their dinners and wanted to go. I was just about to tell them nevermind when it arrived, 40 minutes after ordering. We asked what took so long and the waitress, non apologetic, told us they had a lot of take out orders. I took that to mean that all the take out orders were more important than me, who was sitting in their restaurant, waiting. She still wasn't apologetic when she said she would give us 10% off. In fact, at our complaint she seemed irritated, playing more to the idea that my satisfaction was meaningless to her as she had more important customers to tend to. In short, I will not be returning to Sushi J. If their take out orders are so important to them, perhaps they should switch to a take out only restaurant. Maybe then, in house customers won't be such an inconvenience to them.
23	1	a	I had a craving for Pho and egg rolls and this is the place definitely hit the spot .
24	1	a	This review is based on their pho. Being that I am a friend of one of the employees, I got a tour of how they make their pho. I posted three photos from the kitchen (grilling onions, ingredients, and simmering pot). They use an assortment of beef and beef bones with the ingredients in the pictures. They told me it takes about 12 hours of simmering to make the soup. \n\nI have been to many pho places in LV and here in Colorado. It may be a subtle difference, but most pho places' soup base isn't as flavorful as the one I had at Pho Lan. After seeing how they make their soup base, I appreciate the food and their pho a lot more.
25	1	a	great service \ncustomized\nand great food!
26	1	a	Ate here about 7:20 pm Sat/12 Jul with my NY visiting buddy and his family (spouse and kids):\n- We tried this place since it's so close to my home.\n- Everyone enjoyed their food, which included marinated beef, pho, vermicelli, eggrolls appetizers.\n- Prices are reasonable.\n- Nice ambiance, great service.
27	1	a	I just stopped in with a friend to get rice because we needed some and didn't have a rice cooker.  I received complimentary eggrolls with it!  Took the order to go, but the service was excellent, so I can't wait to try many of the authentic Vietnamese dishes they serve :)  The place is brand new, so it was super clean and everyone seemed friendly.
28	1	a	Clean restaurant and friendly staff. \n\nOrdered shaken beef, spring rolls and pho dac biet.  \n\nOverall the food is good.  The pho broth could be hotter and a little more robust but the flank, tendon, tripe where all good. \n\nRecommended.
29	0	a	I wanted to try a new place for pho because I saw the good reviews on here but I was disapoointed. The pho was too overbearing for me. I usually eat all my pho no matter how big the bowl is, but this pho had no appealing taste. The egg rolls were bland. The com bo luc lac my brother had was okay, but I definitely prefer pho so 1. The nuoc cam was very bitter, tasted like they used spoiled oranges. However, I gave the second star because the staff was very nice. I will not return, sorry.
30	1	a	"Always on the lookout for some pho action in the Valley, I first saw this business pop up on the new business listing, but soon quickly disappeared. Later on, I saw one of my friends bookmark this place. Looking at the reviews, I was kind of surprised no elites had checked out this spot. Might as well take one for the team!\n\nOn the Yelp map, this location is pretty hard to find. Here is an easier way, just park in front of the I-Naba restaurant. It's right in front of that building. I thought they had been building up this spot for a long time.\n\nUpon entering, it's a very well taken care of resto. It could be due to the fact that everything is brand new. There is plenty of seating, and it fits the bill of a pho restaurant. After ordering, the food came out in a reasonable time.\n\n#7 - Pho Dac Biet (combination everything pho) - I thought that the broth was ok. It had a light beef flavor, while I prefer a more robust one, but it was good. They gave a lot of noodles, and they were properly prepared. The bean sprouts/Thai basil/jalape\u00f1o peppers were very fresh, and they gave a ton of bean sprouts. The meat was one of my favorite parts. The brisket was so good and had a real \""beefy\"" flavor. The rare beef and meatball were very fresh and tasty as well. One criticism about this dish would be that I wish there was more meat. I thought they gave a fair amount of brisket, but they could have used a couple slices more of their rare beef, another meatball, more tripe, and more than just 1 tendon. Especially when After the yelp discount the total came out to 8.70, Yikes!!\n\nThe service was pretty good as well. The servers came around to make sure I had enough water at all times, and they even brought me some extra napkins without having me ask.\n\nEven though I think it's a little bit more pricey than other pho joints, I thought the quality was pretty good. I still have my favorite spot, but this might be a possible replacement if my spot burns down or something. I wish they would give a little bit more of their fantastic meat, but ::shrugs::"
31	0	a	"I saw lots of good review on yelp , so try Pho dac biet , the broth has no taste , meat and pho is sooooo much less . Can't even feel u up . When to \""Lee sandwich\"" get me a sandwich after ."
32	1	a	We tried the bun bo hue and pho dac biet. I just moved to Las Vegas last month, and I am happy that I found a good place to have good Vietnamese food!
33	1	a	Friendliest waiter I've had in a while.  Mom is in the back cooking and has been cooking for her different restaurants for 20+ years.   \n\nPho was even complimented by my picky 8 & 12 year olds.  LARGE servings of pho and also noodle dishes.
34	1	a	Pho broth was clean, NO MSG, and the noodles/herbs were fresh. Some people might think that the broth is bland , but that may be because they are so use to the overload of salt and MSG..  I also ordered the mini bun xeo pancakes appetizer which was tasty.\n\nReally great hidden mom and pop joint. EXCELLENT SERVICE! :) Go support them!
35	1	a	Great service and food \nThe fried chicken wings were awesome\nHad egg appetizer was crispy and great flavor!  I never had it before it was real good
36	1	a	We were in the area looking for Pho and this place had great reviews. It's very clean and the staff is extremely friendly and helpful (which can't be said about most pho restaurants). The pho broth was very good on top of that. We will come back again when we're on this side of town.
37	1	a	PHO this place is clean and open with TVs The food is pretty good had #7. Quality service. Tapwater is purified, I think. We will be back for sure... I approve this message J K KOOL.....
38	1	a	Had the Bun Bo Hue with spring rolls and a young coconut to drink.\n\nThe soup was delicious all normal condiments were provided and service was excellent! Their water has a secret in it that you just have to try. Very different from other restaurants but very delicious!
39	1	a	Was graving some great Vietnamese food while on our trip to Las Vegas and since we are originally from Orange County where there are plenty of great Vietnamese restaurants, we were expecting the best. Thank you Yelp for leading us to this great restaurant. The place was very clean and staff was very friendly and attentive. There was plenty to choose from. Of course the kids wanted their fried rice and egg rolls which came out crunchy and flavorful. I loved their grilled pork chops with rice and veggies. The hubby ordered the #7 beef noodle pho which had a very tasty broth. We ordered some chicken wings for the road as well. We will surely visit again when we're in Vegas.
40	0	a	Portions were really small. Food was bland. I usually get full from just eating an appetizer. I ate both app and entree and barely filled me up. Egg rolls were undercook because it's still pink on the inside so I decided to just give that to the dogs. This will be the first and the last time coming here. Maybe that's why only one table was filled and it was there own worker.. Haha! I'll stick to chinatown.
41	1	a	The food was great. The service was very friendly. You should stop by Pho lan when your in town.
42	0	a	Don't understand the 4-1/2 star rating. I had the chicken pho. The broth had no flavor. The chicken did not taste fresh and was extremely dry. Tried husband's pho with rare steak, meat was also chewy and dry, though broth was better than mine. Service was fine. This one we can definitely cross off the list.
43	0	a	Do not recommend come here for food. Food is super slow and service is bad. Dont let the photo trick you, the food is alot less and different from the photos...
44	0	a	The ambience was extremely akward, it was so damn quiet, all you hear is the annoying veitnamese pop music. When I leave a resturant I expect to be full and I wasnt even close to that. The menu pictures are extemely decieving. We ordered #5 and it was filled with red onions and vegetables and minimal pieces of meat, basically a mouthful of nothing but the picture clearly depicted a salad filled with beef. All the meat tasted like it was frozen. A lot of reviewers are saying  that the bun bo hue was extremely good, I could not disagree more. It was not even spicy and the broth tasted exactly like the pho broth-pathetic! Portion sizes do not reflect prices either, other vietnamese portions are twice as much for the same price. Our final bill totaled almost 100 bucks and we were all still starving. Also be ready to pay 15% gratuity, so basically an extra 10 bucks. I definitely wont be coming back. The lone star is for the attentive waiters who do a great job.
45	1	a	We are very satisfied with the food and service. Unlike most authentic Vietnamese restaurants, the service is really good. Our food came great tasting and timely. The restaurant is all clean and pleasant. We will definitely come back and recommend this place!
46	0	a	"i went there expecting this restaurant to be better or the same as \""pho kim long\""..is not even in the same league. There's nothing special about this resturant the food is so-so..went in rush hour and the restaurant was empty, that was a sign I should have just walk out...Pho Kim Long still the best for pho and everything"
47	0	a	Went into this shop by direction of the owner of another shop and I have to say it was the worst. I had brought up another shop owner and the owner of Seven Vapor just talked shit about him. Word of advice don't talk shit to customers about the guy that without him you wouldn't have a shop. I went there once and will never go back.
48	1	a	Had my fridge fixed when it wasn't cooling and freezing. Excellent communication and professional.  Highly recommended!
49	0	a	Nail tech didn't respond to ouch or pulling my foot away when she stabbed in to my cuticle. She continued the same procedure with every nail. I finally asked her to stop and she gave me a dirty look and started yelling in another language. Whatever, you drew blood. I'm done here. \n\nStay away from the crazy place.
50	0	a	I give this place no stars what so ever. Charlie gas no idea what he is doing. I got a whole new nail set today and the nails are in even and the acrylic isn't placed evenly through out my nail... It also isn't even on some of my nails fully. I had to tell him numerous times to be careful using the electric tools because he cut me deep on a few fingers and also wasn't paying attention when he was using tools. He bumped and messed up my nail and when I asked him to fix it he said it would be 5$ extra. My nails and fingers are a mess. The top cost is no good and my nails are full of air bubbles don't go here if you want good nails!
51	0	a	"If you want your fluffy gorgeous comforter to come back looking like a dingy, lumpy mess then take it here! The sign out front just says \""CLEANERS\"" When bringing it in a guy clearly distracted by the soccer game was trying to get me out as quickly as he could so he could get back to watching.  When I showed him a stain I wanted removed he quickly brushed me off with \""sure, sure. Come tomorrow.\"" I should've grabbled my blanket & left right then.  \nThe next day a young girl asked what my blanket looked like & if it was any laying by the door, I said no.  I showed her my ticket & she then asked me to look through the stack of blankets (WTH) I saw it at the bottom & she then handed me shirts that were on top. I explained the shirts weren't mine & she just shrugged it off & put them back. Not cool.  Once I got home I noticed taking it out of the bag it felt MUCH thinner. I set it on the bed to examine & sure enough all the filling was bunched together, color was completely off, stitching was frayed, there were extra stains that weren't there to begin with & it was as flat as could be.  We called & the girl said we would have to call after the weekend to talk to the manager. My husband went in & spoke with the manager who said he just followed the directions on the tag (riiiight) & that there wasn't anything he could do.  My husband told him that he should at least refund us the money of the cleaning which he finally agreed to.  Never taking my things here again! I will continue to make the drive to my usual place."
52	1	a	There tacos taste Soo good make you wanna slap your Momma                                                                            ......
53	1	a	Tried this place for the first time last night for our Friday night Mexican food fix.\nI had the vegetarian burrito. It. Was. Bomb.\nHubby had the carne asada burrito & loved it as well.\nWe will be back!!!
54	0	a	"I really want to like this place because it's the closest Mexican food place to my house. First what I like about it; certainly the location. The interior has also been updated nicely too. The owners of this place are completely new; this location had previously been 2 other Mexican places before; one was good, one not so good. The women working the counter were very friendly and the menu is clear.\nWhere it needs improvement; the layout inside is sparse, they can not accomodate a family eating a meal here. A few small tables is all they currently have. I'd like to see a chips and salsa station; waiting for your food isn't as bad when you have a snack.\nI've ordered breakfast burrito's here twice; the first time I ordered an egg & cheese. I got egg, cheese and potato (I'm not a potato fan). The menu does list potatoes in all the burrito's and I didn't specify \""no potato\"" so I really won't ding them for that. So I decided to give it another try and this time I did specify \""no potato\"" and I did get what I ordered, however, my tortilla is overcooked with several burnt spots (meh, I don't like a burnt taste to my tortilla). I do like the green and red salsa they serve (I mix them together). A good kick but not over the top.\nThey are open M-Sat, closed on Sunday. So overall, currently they have a \""meh\"" 2.5 rating from me, however, I will give them another try and will update my review accordingly. I have to try some of the other foods as well. I think this place has potential to be a good one so give it a try; they are new and perhaps they will use the feedback they are getting from customers to make improvements."
55	0	a	My boyfriend and I had been flying all day and were hungry and craving Mexican food. So we came here. First of all they gave our order to some one else on mistake (get it together people, they weren't even busy) and took sooooo long to remake it. The manager was standing right there as he noticed what was going on and didn't even apologize for the inconvenience. The rice was DISGUSTING and the beans were bland. My burrito tasted like a frozen chicken burrito. I would NOT recommend coming here. This airport has a lot of food options. So go else where!!!
56	0	a	I was excited to see Los Taquitos at Sky Harbor Terminal 4 I been going to the location off 16th street for a long time and I am a big fan of their tacos and homemade salsas.\n\nI even saw a sign on the wall last time I was in the 16th st restaurant talking about opening in Terminal 4\n\nThis is nothing like the restaurant this is different from top to bottom and disappointing to say the least\n\nThe other reviews and pictures are spot on so I won't bother posting more very very disappointed
57	0	a	Worst Mexican food I've ever had and being from San Diego, I've sampled tons. The food is bland and the workers were constantly getting orders wrong.
58	0	a	Horrible service and non authentic tasting food. These breakfast burritos may fly in Louisiana but definitely not in Phoenix.
59	0	a	If you hate flavor, come here! Chicken unseasoned, and overcooked till good and dry... generally flavorless food. Mexican food without cheese, pay $1 extra for that.. pass next time. Manager was friendly at least... only reason for the second star...
60	0	a	Airport food rip off! Over priced steam table tacos with no flavor. I guess the only flavor you could add is to drowned it in hot sauce. I can't believe how much of a rip off this was, high price, so little food with no flavor. Meh! I got a better huge meal of Chinese food at Love Field in Dallas.
61	0	a	Good burritos.  Unfortunately tried to add the $2 chips and salaa (didnt see it on the menu) after the order was placed.  Cashier wouldnt do it because the $2 is the discount with the order.  Try harder?  Little annoyance it was so easy to solve.  She couldnt be bothered.  Please train your cashiers she should have known how to do it.
62	1	a	This has got to be my favorite place to get breakfast at Sky Harbor. I literally walked all the way from a C Gate to get here and have a breakfast burrito before my last flight.\n\nI get an egg and cheese burrito and add avocado, for 50 cents, it is SO worth the extra cost. The eggs are seasoned well, the pico del gallo is fresh and the papas (potatoes) are so tasty!! It's an amazing combination.\n\nThe past three visits to Los Taquitos, the same girl has been working the register and she is the nicest. She offers a lot of suggestions to travelers who have no clue what to get and is so friendly to everyone.\n\nHighly recommend for a breakfast that will leave you full and happy for your next morning flight :)
63	0	a	Said they open at 0600. At 0610 I asked if they were open after ignoring the line that had formed and I was told 5 more minutes. At 0620 they had still not opened. I was hoping to catch breakfast before an early flight but I wasted all the time I had in line. At this place.
64	0	a	They did not take my order down correctly. I ordered a burrito and requested all bean vs rice as a side.  They did not specify this on the ticket. When I got a plate full of rice I expressed that I did not want the rice and requested all bean.  Instead of placing the burrito on a new plate that had all being they just didn't even give me my side f***** my burrito in a bag. They're extremely slow so if you're in a hurry trying to get to your next flight I do not recommend this establishment not to mention they can't even get your order correct.
65	0	a	This place is horrible.  Twice now, gave it a second chance and still bad.  The staff couldn't give a damn about anything.  Asked my name and said Joe, they said Chuck.  Ok, I don't care about that so give me some decent food.  Asked for no cheese since I'm lactose intolerant so I get chicken street tacos and beans and rice with cheese.  Happened the first time too.  Gave food back to the guy to fix, a minute later a girl brings my food up but calls it a different name of a guy that just left, told her it was mine, she didn't say anything just took it away.  The guy tells her it's mine so she turns to me with a nasty look and gives it to me.  Freakin strange.  Owners, get a clue and stop using airport employees.  Hire your own people who give a shit and pay them what they deserve.  The tacos were spicy but lack any other flavor, the beans like glue, and the rice beyond flavorless.  Will not eat here again.
66	0	a	Food is okay when they get your order right! I think forced labor gives better customer service but at least the location is convenient.
67	0	a	Let me start by saying I frequent Los Taquitos regualrly at their 16th St. location and love it. The airport location is terrible. I actually threw my food out. The beans where watery and flowed out across the entire container, the rice was bland and over cooked, and the meat was under seasoned. Do yourself a favor and go to LGO or one of the other places that is doing good airport food, and only go to Los Taquitos outside of the airport.
68	0	a	Sucks that this place was how we started our vacation off. \nWe had an early flight, so by the time we made it to our layover, we were pretty hungry. We didn't have much time so we thought some tacos and burritos would hit the spot.\nWrong.\n\nNot only was this place was pricey, you barely get any food. A tiny scoop of rice and beans, and 3 small tacos that looked miserable. I ate 1 taco before the corn tortilla fell apart. I dumped the other 2 and just ate the rice and beans. \n\nIt was also super packed and crowded, with barely a place to stand. Don't get your hopes up of finding a chair to sit in.\n\nLuckily we were heading to Texas, where they have the best tacos around, so we could easily forget our experience here.

I took the time off work and rushed home to grab my 2 teenage boys for the class.  Upon arriving we were seated, then shortly afterward - a staff member, came to us and said \""I AM GOING TO HAVE TO ASK YOU TO LEAVE\"" b/c my son's were minors and it violated their liquor license policy..  He then went on to tell us, \""You can call the owner, I'm sure they will take care of you later.\""  I was beyond shocked, because my sons and I have painted in the past at the Henderson and Las Vegas locations without incident.  They even offer kids classes on weekends and they even have; \""adult classes for 13 year olds and older\"" as a disclaimer.  My sons felt the unjust treatment and told me, the host made it seem like we did something wrong to throw us out like that. -- None the less, I spoke to a Christina not too long afterward who was just as rude and unsympatheic -- She offered to reschedule the class at another location and added complimentary food and drinks.  -- Like; this is it.. Take if or leave it..  I reluctantly rescheduled for another class and I'm hoping I won't have to write another bad review for this business.."
70	0	a	There is a groupon for wine and canvas that is $25 but you must make a reservation online. The voucher code does not work on mydesignandwine website to make the reservation. I wanted assistance I speak to someone about why the voucher wasn't working and if I could place the reservation over the phone since I bought the groupon already. I started my first call at 10:00am. It's now 5:34pm and I still have had no point of communication. I've emailed them through the contact information online as well and still no response. Having called over 10 times throughout the day but there's not even an option to leave a message because the mailbox is full. As great as this would have been the lack of customer service is very very poor because there is no way for a customer to even receive service with the number provided. This is ridiculous and unprofessional. It requires a reservation to book this wine and canvas night which requires arranging my schedule but I can't even confirm the reservation because there is no one available to speak to. This has been a terrible effort to put forth in and will clearly not recommend this place and tell groupon about this as well.
71	0	a	"I don't expect much from buffets because I've been disappointed so many times. I went at 4pm for the seafood buffet which was way overpriced. I paid 86.00 for four people including a 6 year old child. There are no discounts on seafood night for children. I also had a players card. I thought the food was okay. I did enjoy the variety of desserts (sugar-free). Overall I think you should go when you're really really hungry and feel like splurging. It  wasn't amazing but it wasn't horrible. It was like \""eh\""."
72	0	a	Yuck. I was in the area and hungry so I decided to stop in for the Sunday brunch buffet, which is $11.99 pp with a players card. It was a little after noon when we got there but the brunch is supposed to be until 3. All the breakfast items were cold, old and hard. I tried the eggs and they were hard and crusty. The French toast was rock hard and the sausage patties were inedible. The best thing I had was a bagel with lox and cream cheese! The dessert section was lame, but they did have gelato and a variety of soft cookies. I tried the spumomi gelato and added little mini marshmallows on top and I almost broke my tooth chewing on one of the marshmallows. I will not be back.
73	1	a	So, this was once Feast Buffet.  I'm glad there's nothing that really changed though except for the name. As I've written in my Feast Review that I could no longer find, the best time to go is when they serve whatever food you like.  There's seafood night which I'm not too concerned about since I'm allergic to shellfish, and then, there's Lechon Tuesday!\n\nMy buddy, Lawrence M was excited when I told him they have lechon. So, off we went!  We weren't sure what time they close so, we felt bad when we got there 3 minutes before they close.  We had a plan B in mind and were ready to march to a different place to eat but they allowed starving gym rats like us to go ahead and stuff our faces.  It really pays to be polite and kind! The hostesses, our server and foo station attendants were nice eventhough we got there so late. So yeah, they close at 9pm.\n\nDinner for us was only about $12 with military discount on Veterans Day.  Normally, it's about $12/person and you get a discount with a player's card. That's really cheap! I'll say this again, lechon can be expensive because not a lot of places have it. You have to be in-the-know where to get lechon and normally, you have to pre-order it and buy the whole pig for abput $200 depending on the size of the pig. Anthony Bourdain dubs this succulent pig with crispy skin THE BEST PIG he's ever had. So, even if you paid full price for the buffet, you definitely get your money's worth. Get this, they even have Mang Tomas lechon sauce.\n\nThey have the typical buffet fare such as prime rib, turkey, BBQ ribs, salads, pizza, pasta, potatoes, veggies, Chinese food, Mexican food, pies, cakes, cookies, ice cream, etc. Since we got there so late, the soft serve was liquid - but I didn't care, I just want the taste. The lady behind the counter kept telling me that it's liquid. But I like ice cream soup. The only thing was the coffee ice cream had ice particles. The other flavor I got was fine. The lady behind the ice cream and pie counter was sweet and funny.\n\nItems on my plates:\nLechon - absolutely great! Skin was crispy - finding crispy skin requires great skill. 5/5\n\nChicken Fajitas - a bit dry. 2/5\n\nSteamed BBQ Pork Buns - most buffet places that serve these are awful - too doughy, too dry. These were quite good for a buffet place. 4/5\n\nSesame Balls - they're tinier than the ones you'll find at Chinese restaurants but this isn't a Chinese restaurant. These have red bean inside. 4/5\n\nFried Plantains - I love fried bananas! Some bananas were soft, some were firmer. I pefer the softer ones as they tend to be sweeter. 4/5\n\nMeatballs - these were pretty good. Either that or I was just very hungry after working out. They're not dry and they're quite tasty. 3.5/5\n\nPrime Rib - juicy, medium-rare slice of beef. Mmmmm...3.5/5\n\nTurkey - I was expecting a very dry piece of turkey because it's closing time and it probably has been sitting under a heating lamp forever. I was pleasantly surprised that it was juicy. 4/5\n\nFrench Fries - I was so happy to see they have fries. I love fries! Warm, crispy fried potaoes. Add a little bit of salt and I'm happy. 4/5\n\nKielbasa - I've been good at avoiding cured meats lately but Lawrence gave me his sausage. Since it was already on my plate, I had to try it. Maybe, I'm not used to salt anymore but it was pretty salty. 3/5
74	1	a	Pretty good buffet and better than the surrounding local casinos.   Good salad bar and desserts.    Pizza also good.   Can't say anything is excellent but average or above.   One little thing I notice is that they must have a lazy food preparer in the back because their chicken for their fajitas and Chinese dishes is cut in large pieces and not small as usual. Try fitting them in a small corn tortilla and see what happens.   Same with some of the veggies.   That shows they rush things and need to be more attentive.  Service is also good. Like in most buffets they need to stir their foods more often.
75	1	a	I was referred to Select Import by Just Inspections down the street when I failed my emissions inspection.  Just Inspections first suggested I go to Toyota (the dealership, as my car as a Camry) because they thought my car's issues might be covered under the Toyota recall.  Turns out my car was too old of a model, but I found it very impressive that Select suggested that instead of just doing the repair and taking the money.\nToyota could have repaired my car, but I called Select again and they quoted me several hundred dollars less than the Toyota dealership, so I went back to them.  Car was taken care of quickly and efficiently. I had to drive the car another 30+ miles to be re-tested for emissions, but Select told me to come back and they'd check it out for me (free) before I had it reinspected. So I did, they checked it out quickly, and I passed my inspection.\nThis is a fabulous place with great customer service  - especially Stephanie who I dealt with the whole time (and who also talked me through some stressful situations at the Toyota dealership). Id go there again in an instant and highly recommend it.
76	1	a	"i'm new to the area (by only a month), and in the worst week of my life my van's power sliding door decided to have a mind of its own. it opened randomly (thankfully while stationary) and would not close. so for 2 weeks, we had to move our daughter's car seat to the other side and climb over her if we needed to get to the back seat or move the seat over again. annoying!\n\ni did some research online and saw that toyota service repair was useless, as usual, so i opted to try my luck with yelp's network of reviews. i feared taking it in seeing that a lot of people were complaining about $1500+ service repairs for the door. but...i thought i would test my faith on yelp. i happened upon select import auto service, and i brought my van in today. boy howdy! they are the cat's pajamas when it comes to great service!\n\ni had them look at the door, change the oil, adjust the squeaky a/c belt and check the maintenance light. they did all of this, including the door for only $65! they recommended a collision repair place for our door, since it seemed that the door needed to be realigned, but (man!) i am so glad i didn't have to pay a cent to have it fixed. they did what they called an \""initialization procedure\"" which fixed the issue. genius! \n\nso if you are looking for some awesome customer service and don't want to be swindled, check these guys out!"
77	0	a	Man I hate to do this!  So after all that raving...\n\n$70 for an oil change & tire rotation and they said that because my tires were bowed that it would make some noise, but that it wouldn't affect my safety level.  No problem.\n\nNow the car has been making a TON of noise.  So we took it back in to another shop and they said that the wheel was falling off!  Whoever had put the tires on the last time didn't tighten the lug nuts properly.\n\nNot only is that scary due to the fact that the tire could have actually fallen off and someone could have gotten severely hurt--someone could have actually died.  I really held this place to a higher standard.
78	0	a	Brought my car in for a noise under the hood and an oil change. They diagnosed it for a bad serpentine belt and would be 550 for the repair and oil change. So I approved and left my car overnight. I got it the next day and had the same noise. So your telling me the mechanic didn't hear it again after replacing the serpentine belt?? \nCalled in and set an appointment at 10 for Saturday. Lester said no problem and he'll call me later with the issue. He never told me they are closed at 1 on Saturday and reopen on Tuesday!!\n So I was with out my car for 4 days and the water pump which was the initial problem would be another 500 however they deducted the labor for the water pump from my first repair which saved 175 but in my opinion I still paid for something that wasn't the problem. \nI also requested on Saturday that the driver visor be replaced and by Tuesday at 5 the part still hadn't came in. Screw it, give me my car and get me the hell out of here. Lester did give me  free exterior car wash at Auto Bell so I have that going for me (whoopiedido). \nLester seems clueless and isn't very helpful explaining quotes and his service isn't great. I had to call and check on my car, and I had to remind him to email a quote, I had to show up to see if my car was ready, I had to, I had to, I had to... \nThis is my first yelp review but I don't want anyone to make the mistake I did. Steer clear! \nDang cars, why can't they run forever \nKyle.
79	1	a	What can I say Carley is an incredibly talented hair stylist. She takes the time to get to know you and listen to what you want in a hair style and color.  Her recommendations and colors are spot on. She is definitely a bright stylist and so friendly you feel like family. I'll be back to see Carley again and spread the word about how great she is!!
80	1	a	Always have great service with D (don't want to butcher the spelling of his name). Color is always great does what I ask. \n\nDaughter got a kids cut from Carly. Great cut everything we ask for.
81	1	a	Tony is one of the best colorists if not THE best colorist in this city! His staff is great and he trains them well. Their eagerness to learn more is what makes them all such a great team. Tony is excellent with blondes. If you are as picky and skeptical as I, your expectations will surely be met if not exceeded. XOXO
82	1	a	Tasty beers on tap, cool atmosphere and music. Came for lunch and stuffed myself silly - very generous portions for the cost! Would definitely come back again for some more BBQ ribs, fried chicken and mac n cheese. Yummo!
83	0	a	This company put out a Living Social deal for a deep clean on a house and have received many many purchases.  Since I am moving out of my house I bought the deal and have called twice every day to schedule my appointment.  They have not once answered the phone or returned any of my messages.  I have 2 days left to cancel my purchase and will be doing so promptly after this posts.
84	0	a	Do not use this company!  Bought a living social deal that seems like a scam as I have called 7 times to try and book with no returned call . If you too bought the deal file a complaint with living social ASAP.
85	0	a	Same as everybody else... bought the deal, called every day for a week, no return call... called Terry A. no answer... who knows what or why but DO NOT BUY THE LIVING SOCIAL DEAL. And how does she have 5 stars here when everybody is giving her 1?
86	0	a	"I'm glad the owner gave herself five stars! Like everyone else- I called numerous times before I reached someone, made an appointment and then never heard from them.  Called about 10 times to confirm my appointment and for several days after they no-showed. Never got a return call. Too late to get a refund from living social so I got their \""bucks\"" instead. I cannot believe living social is offering them again, as is Deal Chicken."
87	0	a	I could not be more annoyed by this company if I tried!!!  Purchased the voucher through Living Social on July 7 and had an appt. scheduled for the 24th.  They were a No Show.  I phoned Maid by Design and no one answers the phone.  I called Living Social and they got in touch with owner, Terry, who told them my appt. was for the 31st (not true).  So, I tried to call to confirm the appt. for today and still no answer.  No one showed up this morning at the appointed time.  I called Living Social and told them I wanted a refund and they agreed to return the charges to my credit card.  STAY AWAY FROM MAID BY DESIGN...SOMETHING SMELLS REALLY ROTTEN WITH THIS BUSINESS.
88	0	a	"The way Maid by Design conducts business is absolutely appalling. \n\nFirst, it is damn near impossible to get in contact with anybody. I tried for 2 weeks before someone finally got back to me. And it was via text message or email. I have not been able to speak to a live person.\n\nSecondly, despite \""being on the schedule\"" for my appointment today. They never showed up. I called numerous times today, again to no avail.\n\nLastly, when someone finally answered the phone today, I was hung up on. \n\nI would avoid this business AT ALL COSTS. I've already reported them to LivingSocial and I don't expect their business to be around much longer. \n\nAVOID MAID BY DESIGN. You've been warned."
89	0	a	Just to make everyone aware living social IS giving refunds! I was emailed today and told mine would be available in 3-5 days so if you are as un happy with this company as we are please contact them!!\n\nI called so many times to try and scheduled it was crazy! I wrote on Facebook, I emailed. I am one step away from calling the news. I can't believe anyone would operate their business this way! \n\nGood luck everyone!
90	0	a	"If I could give no stars I would too. I was reluctant to try this Living Social deal with a company that was, at the time, not rated and now I wish I had listened to my gut. Customer service is non-existent. When I did speak to someone to set up the appointment, she was rude and seemed very distracted. I think she is overwhelmed with the response to the $69 4,000 sf deep house cleaning deal on Living Social and now has no way to complete the jobs. I have yet to read a review of Maid by Design even showing up. I am so disappointed with this company AND with Living Social for not doing a better job screening these bogus companies. I am going to request a refund and never use either company! This is one of those \""too good to be true\"" scenarios!"
91	0	a	"SCAM. STAY AWAY. \n\nLike everyone else, I purchased a Living Social deal for this company last week. I received an email from Living Social this morning saying \""You recently redeemed your deal to Maid by Design. How did it go? We want to know.\""\n\nI was confused as I have NOT redeemed the deal or made an appointment yet, so I logged in to see if it was a mistake. My account said that the merchant (Maid By Design) marked the deal off as \""redeemed\"". \n\nI called Living Social and the rep tried to get a hold of the merchant while I was on hold, but not surprisingly they could not reach her. They will try again within 24 hours and then escalate the problem. I just want my money refunded at this point."
92	0	a	If I could give them less than one star I would. I bought a deal through Living Social. Then I called them to schedule my service I left 5 messages over a 3 week period. Nothing. Nada. No call back. They never answer their phone. Then, today I got an email from Living Social that I redeemed my coupon. They wanted to know how the service was. Ha! I called them to explain and they said they will return my money. The ad is still running though! I'm sure I'm not the only one. It seems like a scam to me.
93	0	a	Waste of time! Do not buy this living social. Never returned phone calls or showed up for scheduled appointment. SCAM ALERT!!!!
94	0	a	PROBABLY A SCAM - DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY!!!! I was interested in purchasing their Living Social deal, but had some questions. I called & left a message twice in 2 days, as well as filling out their web form and never heard back. I'm thankful that I did not purchase after seeing all the other posts on YELP. ON A SCALE OF 1 TO 10 THEY GET A MINUS 20.
95	0	a	Yup, just like the other reviewers, I got jipped. \n\nBought their Living Social voucher, then suddenly received an email saying my voucher had been redeemed--what??\n\nCalled MbD, no answer. Emailed Living Social, they said to just call MbD. Duh. Called MbD again, and again, and again. No answer.\n\nEnded up getting a refund from Living Social.
96	0	a	I wish it were possible to give negative stars. DO NOT PURCHASE A LIVING SOCIAL COUPON FROM THIS COMPANY. I'm not sure how they can keep offering these deals to living social but purchased my coupon almost a month ago. Have tried on numerous occasions to contact them via phone and email to schedule an appointment and nobody will answer me or respond to schedule an appointment. I'm not even bothering and went ahead to request a refund. It sucks because I'll get credit and not cash back since it was so long to no fault of my own. BUYER BEWARE.
97	0	a	People Listen ~ Please, Please, just like everyone else posting there rating, do NOT use this service or you too will be a VICTIM. Horrible customer service, called for over a week left repeated messages and got no response!
98	0	a	"BUYER BEWARE!! \n\nMy Wife also purchased a Living Social deal with the hopes of having a nice clean house. We should of known something was up when we tried for a couple of weeks to get a hold of someone at the company to make an appointment or at least return our calls. \n\nRight about the time we were going to stop trying and get a refund from Living Social, my Wife was able to get a hold of someone. She spoke with a female at the company and set up an appointment for a cleaning on the 15th, between 11-12. \nAfter the appointment was set up my Wife received an email from Living Social confirming her use of the voucher. My Wife reply saying she has only made the appointment and the services have not been used. \n\nSo, Friday the 15th rolls around and we should of seen this coming, no one shows up. At 12:00 I call the number on the voucher and website, no answer, so I leave a message. Then we notice on their Facebook account they give a number to text for urgent matters. I try texting that number, no response. So at about 2:00pm, I give up hope that anyone will be coming or that I will receive any sort of response or reply. \n\nThis is a sad excuse for a company!!!

99	0	a	I just saw this deal on Deal Chicken and so I thought I would post my review so no one would buy this.  I find it hard to believe that the people from Deal Chicken wouldn't look at these reviews and see that there are over a dozen  reviews for this company at this point and all of them are 1 star.  Why in the world would Deal Chicken do business with these people.\n\nAnyway, when I saw this on Living Social it was the same day my wife went out of town.  I thought it would be nice if I got the house professionally cleaned while she was gone.  I called and immediately got someone (this was a Thursday).  I told the person that I need to know if they had anything available from that Thursday through the next Tuesday.  She told me they could get me in Tuesday at 2 pm.  I told her that would be great and that I would then buy the deal.  I asked her if she needed anything from me and she told me to give her the code so I gave her the voucher number and she marked it as redeemed.  \nWhen Tuesday morning came around I hadn't heard from them to confirm so I called and left a message to verify they were still coming.  They never called and they never showed.  By Thursday I had never heard anything (I had left one more message) but that was the last day to get my money back from Living Social so I called for my refund.  They said that because it had been marked as redeemed they couldn't do it.  I told the lady that they never showed and she said they had to get a hold of Maid by Design.  They emailed me every other day during that time letting me know they were still trying to get a hold of Maid by Design.  All during this time the deal was still available.  It seems crazy that they would even be offering a deal when they aren't even able to get a hold of the business.  Anyway, a week later they finally gave me my money back.  \nWhat a terrible experience!
100	0	a	"And shame on me for letting them \""not show up\"" twice.  I missed 4 hours of work total sitting home waiting (3 hours the first time and 1 hour the second time).\n\nAfter the first time (July), the owner (Carrie), apologized up and down (once I finally got a hold of her), put me on the schedule for another day (August) and said \""I will personally be there to do your house and will call and confirm the day before.\""\n\nWell, I should have known when I didn't get the confirmation call and I couldn't reach her the day before.  But, I waited home anyway.\n\nI'm so furious.  Living Social is working to resolve the problem and hopefully I can get some kind of credit.  I hope everyone on these reviews has contacted them so they have records of the problem.\n\nP.S.  The day before my first appointment I also received a \""redeemed\"" message and \""How did it go?\""  Unbelievable."
101	0	a	Total scam - this company no-showed and will not return my calls.\nI see there is a long list of scorned customers before me...Call @LivingSocial:\n877-521-4191 and they will refund your money as this company has not performed services promised.\nHope this helps!

103	0	a	"So here's my account of a hobby shop that truly needs to  reassess their core values. I walked into this store before they were even opened on Father's Day weekend. \n\nHow we found the store was through searching online for a DJI distributor in Vegas. I find that people who buy DJI products really need guidance on usage and training hence why we were looking for a store front to stop by and ask questions. All we could find was USHobby shop, turns out they are just an online store and Drones Plus is their store front that was to be opened a few weeks later.\n\nWell, my father and I walked into to what we thought would be a pleasant experience. Most hobby store experiences are welcoming. To our dismay we were greeted by the owner, Mike, who stroked his own ego almost every 5 minutes. He came off as arrogant, unfriendly, and quite frankly rude. He told us how he was the head of Sales and how he knew everything about DJI products.\n\nI came in for two reasons: one was to ask about why one of my motors seems to have different resistance than the other three to which Mike just told me to buy a new motor and wasn't interested in helping diagnose the problem. His tech guy also had no answers for me... all he said was \""umm... you should be fine as long as it doesn't make any weird sound\"". Secondly, I was interested in extending the range of my Phantom vision+ to which Mike replied \""Why would you want to do that?\"" And brushed the question off. He kept trying to rush us out the door.\n\nI understand they were a week shy of their grand opening, however there was no need for their \""head of sales\"" to be rude to potential customers. Talk about terrible people skills, not sure he has ever had a job in sales considering how he treated us. He was very condescending in almost every response he gave us and made us feel extremely uncomfortable.\n\nWorst part of all... a few weeks later my motor failed, thankfully it failed during pre flight testing and not 100 ft up. I hope another store opens up in Vegas soon because I wouldn't ever come back so long as Mike is running sales. Future hobbyists beware!"
104	1	a	Great experience  .. will do business  again !
105	1	a	Great little spot for a fast weekend breakfast or workday lunch. Very friendly, accommodating and eager to please. And the place is spotless.\n\nThe menu situation can be confusing. They seem to have more dishes on offer that you would think -- be sure to ask about specials. I'd recommend a specials board that they can change daily in addition to the chalkboard menu behind the counter. \n\nOne little ambience minus: Radio tuned to a Top-40 station is a little intrusive especially when there are commercials. Proprietors should consider hooking up an iPod instead and lowering the volume a little.
106	0	a	Too bad you have to select a star I wouldn't give them any!! Decided to try this place out worst decision ever.. They messed up everything we ordered. 3 phone calls and 2 deliveries later still didn't get what we ordered. Never again!!!
107	1	a	"This place is adorable! It's nice to see a store catering to the \""little guy.\"" Great collection of different types of artists/crafters. \n\n\nInstantly fell in love with the pallet art."
108	1	a	Lovely shoppe! There seems to be something for everyone here! Reasonably priced too. I plan on getting most of my gifts here. \nThere is beautiful knit items,fun kitchen things like potato bags, Pallet wood signs, Fancy Flip flops & Embellished shorts for the kids, Lots of vintage furniture & Jewelry. They even have pillows with states embroidered on them!! \nThis place is just off Serene in a small strip mall  that also has a barber shop, dry cleaners, caterer, work out place & a smoke shop\nSo far I have gotten a day of the dead skull keychain, a steering wheel cover,paracord bracelet for the hubby,fluffy skirt for my grand daughter & a card\nNeed a Gift?? This is the Place
109	1	a	I just moved to the neighborhood and I've been trying out local places. I was craving Chinese food for lunch and remembered seeing Good Taste House when I was driving down 7th Street. My first instinct was to check yelp, and I must admit I was weary when I didn't see any reviews. However, every time I drive by, it smells really tasty, so I decided to give it a shot.\n\nMy boyfriend and I ordered two of the rice bowl lunch specials. He got the orange chicken, and I had the chicken with broccoli, both on a bed of steamed rice. Delicious! They are about the size of a panda bowl from Panda Express but so much tastier! And the price - it's a steal at $3.99! You can upsize the lunch special to come with fried rice, a spring roll and a crab puff for $2 more.\n\nI can't wait to try more of the items on the menu based on my experience today. I'm attaching the menu in the photos. Hopefully the presence of a Yelp review will drive more business their way, because it's definitely a hidden gem. :)
110	0	a	Placed my order at 803. Came exactly 1 hour later food was cold my sesame chicken spilled the whole bag was sticky from the sauce. Ordered house looks mein. It had absolutely No flavor it suckered hardly any noodles I wouldn't pay more than 4$ for it yet I paid double. Spring rolls are meh. OK crab puffs. I will not be ordering from here again it sucks.\nI will stick to super dragon on 12st and northern
111	1	a	"If it weren't for the concrete-block walls, I could have sworn this was a Valentine diner; I love those now nearly extinct '50s-style mini-eateries. You can't really dine in this place except in the 1-table \""patio\"" area near the entrance, since the kitchen takes up most of the little building. That means that it's mainly a take-out and delivery place. The entrance is where you order your food from the friendly lady inside. The food is quite good, a tad above most of the Chinese take-out places that I've tried in the city."
112	0	a	I'd comment on the food but unfortunately I never got the chance to try it. Two hours after placing my order and one call saying the delivery driver was 10 minutes away, I finally call again to find out they were out of pot stickers and hadn't even left yet. They said they called multiple times, which I never got any of their calls. I canceled the order after a total of two hours and 10 minutes for waiting. Terrible service and no compensation for their error.
113	1	a	A coworker brought in the tres leches cupcakes--- to die for!! Love LOVE. Definitely ordering from them soon.
114	1	a	I've never had better cupcakes in my life but their Tres leches are to die for! I will definitely be using them for my launch party next month! \nThe owners are exceptional people
115	0	a	This is my first Yelp review and I really wanted it to be a 5 star! \nSadly I'll have to settle for a 2 :-( \nThis place is ... Interesting lol. \nI didn't really enjoy the way the store looks and it was also kinda hard to find. \nThe cupcake that I had, just a regular chocolate on chocolate, was nothing special. It was kinda dry , like it had been left out for awhile, and just boring. Not horrible, just not something i'd want to get again.
116	0	a	I would love to take u up on your offer however by you saying that I must be confusing your shop with another one nearby is really wrong. U can't make yourself better by putting others down. \nThe things I didn't like about the decorations of your store are just that it's a little country old ladylike to me. I personally don't like chalkboard walls and old pictures.
117	1	a	I'm so happy I checked the hot new businesses in my neighborhood today on my yelp app! I hit the German chocolate cupcake jackpot today, moist and delicious tastes like Christmas at grandma's house! The decor is so cute very country makes me feel warm and fuzzy inside . I will be back soon to try the tres leches and red velvet!
118	1	a	What a fantastic find! I went there with some girlfriends over the weekend and we all left completely delighted and with some extra treats to go. The feminine-industrial chic d\u00e9cor was a great space for our (rather large) group and the owner, Samantha, was incredibly welcoming and attentive.\n\nThe mini-tres leches cakes were my favorite (perfect size, milky without being soggy, and not too sweet). I got the Key Lime one to-go and the tanginess was a delightful complement to the creaminess of the cake. I want to try the other flavors, but it's going to be hard to top that! The pecan-butter cookies and the lemon bars were also favorites with our group. I will be back soon - Now I just need to decide which tres leches to try next...
119	0	a	Went here last week for donuts and had to wait for it to open at 10. Wanted to buy several donuts but they only had five. What?? A bakery with no donuts in the morning. Sorry
120	0	a	I will Samantha. I just would like to know if you do have donuts or the old spelling doughnuts. Lol. I will try your pastries this weekend.
121	1	a	Stopped in last week to try out this new bakery and really enjoyed myself! Grabbed a few items including a tres leches cupcake and a lemon bar amongst others. You can definitely tell these bakers know what they're doing. Freshness is key and it was obvious that they make things in-house at Bakeshop. The decor is very chi\u0107 and inviting, and Samantha, the owner, took the time to chat with me about other items I might also enjoy. I'll definitely be heading back there next time I'm in the area.
122	1	a	I stopped by Bakeshop yesterday after hearing the rave reviews, and I was so impressed!  The bakery is lovely, and the owners are so welcoming!  Discussed party options as well as cookie decorating and cookies for Santa!  Love places that have such fun activities for the kids!  I of course ordered a fare share of sweets and it was all absolutely delicious!  You can tell they have put their heart and soul into Bakeshop, and I will for sure be going back soon!!!
123	0	a	A few friends and i tried the new all you can eat sushi bar that is currently replacing the famous kaizen sushi restaurant.  I personally found this all you can eat sushi bar better than most all you can eat with a few down points. The waiters were horrible.  I understand that the restaurant is new ,  however the coordination of the staff was terrible,  i   had to   ask him when he brings us the sushis to tell us which one were which . He did  not know the prices of his  bottles are the amount and when finally i  ordered a  bottle...they did not have any more of the  one i wanted!\n\nFish and vegetables seem fresh ,  way better product that   i have seen compared to sushi crescent or kanda sushi HOWEVER they drown all there tartar and sushi in mayo which is very disappointing. \n\nI believe the restaurant is still adjusting but  overall it is an  ok   restaurant. ...!
124	0	a	Not happy. Didn't order from buffet, waiting 1 hour for service!!! They are watching me, so I won't eat!!! And michael (the manager) saw I had garnish in my plate and asked me what is that!!! Omg. Awful addition to westmount!Worse place ever!!!!! Do not go! and The manager michael the manager tells\nMe he is confused. Not happy. Do not go. Go to park restaurant!!
125	1	a	"I think the people raring this place low, are Westmount workers / residents  And perhaps former clients of Kaizen who are unfamiliar with this\ntype of sushi restaurant. \n\nThe location is what use to be one of MTL's most popular and higher end Japanese restaurants : Kaizen Sushi House .\nKaizen was one of our favorite restaurants when I was growing up so I understand the disappointment one might feel if they walk into the same space and expect something more traditional or upscale. \n\nUnfortunately if you know anything about the food industry, you know it's impossible to do what Kaizen did at the price / value of Crystal Sushi. So for this reason I think the reviews are unfair. \n\nI've been to most all you can eat Sushi places in MTL, and this is one of my top 2. Its definitely fresh, the service was friendly and efficient, the lunch price is awesome and the location is accessible, clean casual, and fun to be in. \n\nIf I were to say one thing to be improved on , it would be a wider variety of sauces and or \""flavors\"" BUT this is how they keep the prices so low and can offer such fresh produce I guess so...once again it's definitly at the top of it's game for it's kind."
126	0	a	Food were nice but way too expensive. We waited too long between orders (waiters said too many orders and they all messed up). The waiter set us in an awful spot (in a grim corner). Last order around 9:30 PM or earlier, be prepared for that.
127	0	a	This place is right around the corner from my office so I will often pop in for lunch. When they first opened I thought that the place was pretty good for an all you can eat concept. Fresh ingredients, good service and a nice concept. \n\nHowever, of late I've noticed that the quality of the food has been on the decline. Items such as the salt and pepper squid which was previously lightly battered and very tender have been replaced with much lower quality food. The squid dish, as an example, is now of the heavily breaded, tough and chewy variety. \n\nClearly they have started cutting corners to save costs.  I will not be back.
128	1	a	My rating is based on takeout orders.\n\nAfter reading many reviews, I wasn't expecting much.  \nMy boyfriend and I ordered for takeout and were amazed at the prices vs quantity&quality.\nEach piece came out to under 1$. No where will you find this (ranging prices are between 1.50-2$ per piece)\n\nFood : the sushi was good. I liked everything on the platter and there wasn't too much rice. The salmon sashimi was cut a little thick, but still good.\n\nService : the restaurant was not busy when we went but it was very fast service. We ordered 47 pieces and it was ready in under 15min. Nothing was premade (we had nothing to do but sit and watch, so we truly saw every piece being made in front of us).\n\nDecor : again, we only sat in for a little while, but it seemed very nice and clean.\n\nWe will try a dine-in shortly.
129	1	a	I wouldve never known this little gem was here! Buttttt they are also an authorized UHaul dealer.. I reserved over the phone, they are very easy to arrange with. Wally and  his wife are both very nice.. I needed the truck for a few extra hours and they went out of their way to accomodate :)  will write a second review for the UHaul later.. Anyways their market is incredible!! They have all sorts of imported coffees and the traditional arabic hand held expresso maker.. Which i also bought! Not only did Wally advise me on which coffee would suit my taste.. His wife also explained how much to use and exactly how to use the expresso maker.  My first time making it and it was delicious.  They also had a eatery inside but i was unable to try it as i was in a rush... The store itself was very tidy and Wally takes great pride in honest service. I would reccommend this 1 stop shop to anyone in the area! Dont forget to try the coffee! Thanks Wally! :)
130	1	a	Came highly recommended and I was in need of my dryer being fixed ASAP! Communication was quick, an appointment was made and very quickly after my dryer was fixed. He was very knowledgeable about everything!!! I will definitely use Apex again for any and all appliance repairs!
131	1	a	5: Food- Tuscan Kale Salad at an airport? \nI'm on board! I don't see this type of thing often... but when I do, I usually go for it. \nIt was almost on the verge of being too sweet, but felt like a good choice rather than a cookie or a big bag of nuts... \nTuscan kale, berries, pickled onions, shaved fennel, diced green onions and ummm.. a sweet vinaigrette hit the spot! \n\n5: Customer Service- a few sweeties behind the counter prepping food and taking my money. What a treat. There were no kale salads in the cold case in the front, but they made one for me. Yea. \n\nThere was bit of a line around dinner time, but it worked, because Southwest gave me time to eat in between flights. Yea. \n\nWould I return? Yep. They had a cashew butter and jam sandwich, the simple salad looked good too and hmmm... \nI know there were other options I would have shoved in my mouth in a heart beat, just give me some more time and I may update this review. \n\nK. Happy travels!
132	0	a	Absolutely horrible service on the sandwich side. Avoid if you're even a little worried about time. I sure hope the food is good.
133	0	a	"Subpar even for airport grab and go. Go next door to Humble Pie and place an order to-go for a far better sandwich or salad. \n\nMy husband got the roast beef sandwich, it was not fresh... At all, bland, soggy. Bleh!\n\nI got the Simple Salad... You would think 6 ingredients would be easy to execute, however the carrots were slimy and mushy... Basically on the way to rotten. Everything else in the salad was fine but I opted to use the balsamic dressing from Humble Pie as the creamy white dressing included didn't look like the \""red wine vinaigrette\"" that was supposed to be in the salad kit. \n\nMy son had the PB&J. Not much peanut butter but bread was decent. \n\nSorry, NOCAwich, I think you can do better."
134	0	a	Didn't feel like having tacos and a previous bad experience with humble pie, I opted for this place.\n\n\nService: The lady at the counter was pleasant and quick. Off to a good start plus roasted veg sandwich with pesto, goat cheese and romesco sauce in a wheat toast sounds soooo good! \n\nMy food was taking a little long hmmm ok. Saw some toast sitting on the toaster and thought --- wow those looks awfully burnt. \n\nGot my food. Fries and the sandwich -- no bag? Ok I'll ask for it. Here you go with the guy grumbling I gotta go home. A little unprofessional don't you think? \n\nFries are good but would've liked them more crispy. Opened up my sandwich only to find that burnt toast I was eyeing. I ended up deconstructing the sandwich bec the burn toast overpowered the taste. Got the goat cheese taste-- nothing special. The grilled veggies? No taste at all. Very bland! Yuck! Ended up throwing most of the sandwich away. Off to my connecting flight.
135	0	a	This place makes Panda Express seem like high quality fine dining. Probably the most bland, tasteless chowmein I have ever had. Even soy sauce couldn't help it. Server had to dig around to find chicken in the kung pao dish. To top it off, it was about $10 more than Panda Express would have been for the same dishes. Very disappointed, won't be back, avoid at all costs.
136	0	a	"Sad!  Though fried rice was fresh, chow mein, Ginger Chicken, & Crispy \""Cashew\"" Chicken were OLD and Dry!  Then, when asking about a cup of ice water, I'm told they only have soda water.  Huh?  I'm not shelling out $3.45 for a regular (read: SMALL) soda/soft drink - probably without a refill anyway!  Poor customer service, old/dated food, and attitude from the cashier!  NOT coming back here.  (Can I give 1/4 Star???)  AND, when almost done with \""Cashew\"" Shrimp - that only had peanuts! - there was a half of a cooked toothpick!!!  (I HOPE it wasn't a used Sample Toothpick!)  :-(  1/4 Star is now downgraded to officially ZERO STARS!"
137	0	a	Overpriced crap Asian food. Noodles had wayyyy too much garlic and the entrees weren't that great either. Better off eating McDonald's nearby.
138	0	a	Everything is overpriced in the Flamingo food court, but this has to be the single worst Vegas fast food experience for me. $8.95 for a ***TINY*** child size bowl consisting of a mixture of rice/chow mein and one entree. $3.95 for a large soda, $3.45 for a medium soda. Attitudes from the employees. The Vegas buffets are expensive, but even they are a better deal than this dump, at least you will get a lot more food for the price. I will never be back.
139	1	a	I'm pretty confident they really do have the lowest gas prices in Vegas.  Corner of Buffalo & Sahara.
140	1	a	A great new place specializing in rotisserie chicken at the far east end of the Plateau. A big, open, bright, and beautiful space serving delicious food and cocktails. A group of us shared two whole chickens, which came with fries and coleslaw. I dare say it's the best rotisserie I have had in Montreal...very friendly service and casual atmosphere. Will definitely be returning to try their chimichurri....
141	0	a	I must express my utter distain for the way my family and I were treated when we entered the restaurant and refused entry because of our baby. We double checked Resto-Mtl and the Facebook page and there was no indication that it was a exclusively a bar (which does not allow children) and not a resto-bar which does. The hostess was rude and did not show any empathy for the fact that we had drove over an hour to eat at this venue because until now had heard good things. I'm sorry but as a result I strongly do not recommend this restaurant to my friends and family and to other people with small children including newborns. If possible I would give it zero stars.
142	1	a	Apparently Den means Black in Vietnamese which makes sense of the stark monochrome in this chic space. Very simple room, open kitchen, metallic counter tops, simple list of soups, chicken wings, and beers and cocktails. The Pho was pretty amazing, I went with a friend who has lived in Vietnam for the last several years and he said maybe the beef could be less cooked but the broth and fresh veggies were better than most of what he gets at home in Hanoi. So there's that. \n\nThere were lots of cool people hanging out, the room is sexy and chill, the service was perfect, fast, funny, friendly... I'll be back here often and all the time.
143	1	a	Ok I'm glad this calm sexy little place exists, and everything I said before remains true plus the rolls are delicious. But I have to say this: I get that on a quiet night the staff might use the tv above the bar to watch a movie, but glancing up in time to watch an astronaut vomit, then dig through that vomit and pull out a bloody tooth, was pretty unappetizing...
144	1	a	Right next to the beloved Cafe Aunja.  Totally different environment, and a good one.  My overwhelming impression of this place: excellent service.  \n\nI have been in a few times, once to socialize and once to study.  They always make your drinks immediately (ok, obvious), bring them to you at your seat, are exceedingly attentive, and have terrific attitudes.  You feel like you're being waited on at a nice place. They care if you like their drink recommendations.  The focus is on people who come and stay at the cafe for a long time, which is a business model I don't understand, but hey --- they may be on to something.\n\nThe decor is modern, clean, and simple.  Lounging/front room divided by the counter.  Large back room for studying, with several large tables and lots of plugs, and no music playing in this room.  Social/meeting room with tables/chairs.  Another room with large TV/great for watching the World Cup, let's say.\n\nIt's nice and unusual to find a place that is doing all of the right things right out of the gate.  It's clean, it's open a lot (till midnight during the week, 10pm on weekends) and the Americano is solid.  In sum: I'll be back.
145	1	a	This place was a really good surprise, the Clam chowder was delicious, the staff attentive and the ambient is beautiful.  A good place  if you like sea food. If you are at Courtyard Downtown Montreal do not think twice, it is above the entrance of the parking.
146	1	a	What a gorgeous restaurant architecturally, I cannot wait to come back in the Summer to take advantage of the outside. I adore oysters and we had plenty of them the night we were there: gorgeous West Coast ones and salty yummy East Coast ones. I was sad that the kitchen was closed, seemed kind of early for that, but they gave us some clams to munch on as well which pacified me. Really nice wine list, super fun staff and the washrooms are pretty cool as well :P All in all, I will definitely come back for oysters and trendy times with swank friends. My next visit, I will plan better and try both the lobster roll and the clam chowder, apparently they are to die for.
147	0	a	Doughnuts always seem hard and stale no matter what time of day.  I have also been sold expired milk every time I've been there so now I have to make sure to request unexpired milk when I order.
148	0	a	This location is horrible. In the 3 times that I've visited, they are rude, never thank you for coming and never seem to get my order correct. They're around the corner from my house, but I will not be spending money there again.
149	1	a	The workouts are great. The staff helps you in tailoring the workouts and having a coach in class that helps you with the movements makes it easier to improve!
150	1	a	I just ate here today and let me tell u.. It's really good we got the sizzling sisig and it had an egg on it.. I've never had it with an egg before but I like it.. We also got Pancit Canton Bihon I loved it.. Also the Tonkankatsu out some shit was fried just right
151	1	a	"When we came back everything's perfect except for the server. But the server doesn't stop me for coming back. More \""D Pinoy Joint\"" for me!"
152	0	a	Ok, so I'm hoping to come back and hopefully food will be better. I know they just opened but it seems unorganized and unprepared.\n\nWhen you first walk in, the joint really makes you feel like you're in a restaurant in the Philippines. We waited a little bit but then the waitress came over and seated us. They quickly took our drink order and said she would be back to take our order.\n\nThe wait time from when you place your order to when you actually receive your food is about 45min or so. Not that this is the waitress' fault or anything. They just opened and are severely understaffed. These girls were trying as hard as possible but with only 2 of them running EVERYTHING, they could only do so much. We were not the only ones who had this issue as some people appeared irritated and were complaining to each other. When the food finally did come out, this is what we thought:\n\nLumpiang Shanghai: They were over fried and lacked filling. I think we would prefer to have less of them for more filling and flavor.  Seasoning was a little bit low as well.\n\nCrispy Chicken Skins: These weren't all too bad. A good unhealthy treat that came out after our entres did. Same with the lumpiang(we ordered them as appetizers).\n\nPancit Bihon: They messed up this order for me and gave me a combination of noodles instead. No big deal but it wouldn't have made a difference. I know pancit is supposed to be oily but no flavor on meat or noodles. I had to add salt and siracha in order to taste something,\n\nCombination Plate: This wasn't horrible actually. We got the chicken adobo lechon kawali served with rice. Tasty but the lechon was kinda tough to eat. Too hard actually.\n\nI wanna say that this bad service was only due to the staff being overwhelmed and that if I come back in a couple months or so, they will have figured things out and gotten their flavors in order. Here's to crossing my fingers!!!
153	1	a	Came back to visit Vegas after moving out of Nevada. Getting Filipino food by my neck of the woods is tough. This was a great place. Food was on point and service was fast and friendly. Wish this place was around when I was a local.
154	0	a	I am rating this place based on their food because the place was decent and the staff was super nice. We had the pancit palabok which was disappointing because it was sooo bland, we ordered it to go so i didnt have any fish sauce to sprinkle  to add saltiness to it, i was so bummed! The pork sinigang was good there was a lot of meat and the sourness was just right.  The shanghai was just okay nothing that I would rave about. The biggest offense was the cassava cake it was hard as a rock, and nothing like the cassava cake taste that i am familiar with, i felt i was ripped off buying that, the whole thing went straight to trash. Buy at your own risk with their rice cakes.
155	1	a	If you like a good filipino breakfast served in the evening, a friend and I found this at D Pinoys.  We arrived for dinner/breakfast on weekday night, service was fast, and the food just hit the spot!
156	1	a	I love love love this place. I am a lot closer to DT's and I drive my whole family's butts all the way to flamingo to eat here. The service is quick and the food is just simply delicious. Tinolang manok is my daughters fav... Btw she is only 18 months old.. She's a picky eater but when she smells this soup... She goes crazy.. Lol beef pinakbet-inihaw na baboy- pork skewers- chicken adobo- fresh lumpia- halo halo- super super super yummy. The service is fast... Compared to the one closer to me... I'm glad this place opened up.
157	0	a	The food needs improvement ! its not really good and I'd rather eat at DT's
158	0	a	This joint has replaced the Thai BBQ restaurant that I used to visit which was really good. I decided to stop by one day and check it out with a take out order on the way to work. I waited what seemed like an eternity for my appetizer to be prepared.\n\nWhile I sat waiting for my take out order, I began to sweat my tits off! No air circulation, just a fan blowing hot musty air around. That was a turn off and I will never expose myself to that again. Thank the devil I was just in for a to go order, I would have to of left early during a dining session. \n\nMy lumpia left a lot to be desired, very disappointing to say the least. There were 10 bite sized pieces that set me back $8. I was already frustrated at the long wait, the sitting in a sauna experience and now my appetizer let me down! I ordered the shanghai lumpia which was all wrapper no filling except a couple of peas in it? \n\n\nI may be a German girl but I make Lumpia at home and it is the bomb bud!\n\nI got bent over in this visit, but never again!
159	1	a	It feels home to be here!  Good Filipino food...sinigang..dinuguan ..sisig.. pancit..eggroll... and a lot more. The server/staff/owner are friendly.
160	0	a	"Clearly Joe Pruchnicki, you are as INCOMPETENT as you are RUDE, as I've purchased and sold homes all over the USA & just because my Profile states California does NOT mean I was looking to sell a home in California. The home I was selling (just SOLD) is located in Las Vegas, Nevada near Charleston (in Summerlin). Further, the manner in which I answer my personal home phone is none of your business, as you do NOT pay my phone bill. I have a right to know who's calling. I've never said \""Yeah who's this\"", as I am highly educated (USC Law School) and do not speak the way you have accused me.

161	0	a	I work here in the mall, and was so excited that I would be able to go to somewhere other than Subway on my lunch break.  Unfortunately,  the service here is HORRIBLE! Everyone behind the counter is more concerned about their personal lives rather than the customers that are in their store. Sorry Nestle, but you've been open long enough to have MUCH better customer service. I guess Subway will continue to get my $
162	0	a	Gas station coffee made with an oversized nestle coffee machine, i can make better coffee at home  with my keurig, and the lady didnt know lattes could  be hot, she kept asking if we wanted ice in it:(  and overpriced
163	0	a	I was sadly disappointed. They barley opened and I was excited to try them out. Sorry but everything was dull tasting, I can go to the store, buy the pre-made cookie dough and make better cookies and brownies. Not impressed, save your money.
164	1	a	Welcome to the scene Wasted Grain! Our newest bar/club has easily joined into the nightlife of Old Town with multiple bars inside and outside on the patio, lots of TVs, a large selection of drink and food items and a large dance floor on the second story.\n\n  This place is huge with tons of space! The first floor, including the patio, seem to be more of the bar with the second floor being more of the nightlife club spot. Probably one of the largest bars in old town now, close to the size of whiskey row. There's a really great atmosphere and decor throughout and the food looks great! If only they didn't open till 3pm, it would be a good place for lunch too
165	1	a	Very cool atmosphere. Lounge seating high top seating, huge patio with full bar, bean bag toss, and darts.  Great place for a quick drink after work, and for the younger generation, late nights tearing it up.
166	1	a	"Martini Ranch has become Wasted Grain after some remodeling. I came on a Saturday night and the line was not long and ladies got in for free. The front men were nice and friendly. Once in, the 1st level has the stage which housed a bar and live rock band for the night which covered 80's to contemporary rock and pop music. If you continue straight through to the corridor there is a patio which has darts, corn hole, the bathrooms and stairs to the right to get to the 2nd level. Take the stairs up, then walk across the rooftop patio which has some seating and you will finally reach the club. \n\nThe 2nd level houses a small indoor dance club very similar to Smashboxx. The DJ played a mix of hip hop and EDM and the bar is pretty large so you don't have to fight much to get a hold of a bartender. The VIP booths surround the dance floor and the light effects are mediocre. \n\nThere's another set of stairs right in front of the dance club so you don't have to go all the way around to the initial ones you took to get there. These lead straight to the bathroom from the 2nd floor down to the 1st. \n\nThe age group and ethnic mix was extraordinarily diverse. Probably the most mixed group at a bar or club I've ever seen, even more so than Las Vegas. Ages ranged  equally from the 20's to the 60's and a fairly equal number of men and women as well. \n\nOverall, the layout is interesting and there's some free seating as well as games to play. Ideally, this isn't where I'd like to spend my Saturday night, I'd rather be at The Mint or INTL. I would take relatives visiting Arizona, or friends that just want to \""chill\"" and not party, here, or even a date - that would be fun. But if I really want to have a good time, I want to hit a proper dance club with my friends. But that's just me. This place isn't for everyone but it does have a lot to offer."
167	1	a	Great place. Nice interior and good staff.  The food was pretty good and they have good drinks. Not much more you can ask of a bar.
168	0	a	"This place says they have both DirecTV and Cox to draw people in who are interested in watching football games on the Pac-12 network but they're lying because they have to \""re-wire\"" their TVs so you can't watch anything on Cox. It's amateur hour over here."
169	1	a	Super cool environment, good priced drinks and good food too! Loved that it is a big seahawks bar
170	0	a	Place is great for watching football. Outdoor patio is nice with a few drinking games you can play. The food however was pretty bad. We got the humus, deviled eggs and the bacon wrapped prawns. Everything was either not seasoned or over seasoned. Prawns we're chewy and bacon was burnt. Drinks were good, reasonably priced. This place needs to think about getting a new chef though.
171	0	a	The only reason I am giving 2 stars is because they have 5 star entertainment there. You get 10% off your tab for checking in on Yelp but they wont give it to you. The staff is rude. I had to convince secruity that I was going to the bar the to close my tab. The DJ came on at 1:20 and they kick everyone out of the bar at 1:30. I closed my tab finally and my discount was declined. I won't be back. I'll go see that band at a different, more customer friendly venue.
172	1	a	for good time in old town scottsdale!!!!
173	0	a	"So I rate bars/restaurants/ on a few different things. Obviously, food is a pretty important element of a restaurant. However; the place itself seemed very cool to hang out..if you don't want to eat. :) They have oversized Jenga like you've seen at Dos Gringos, they have corn-hole, lots of seating, lots of TVs and indoor and outdoor areas. The wait staff was somewhat efficient but not friendly. I asked for a water and never got it. (I assume because that was not a paid drink) The guys in the kitchen looked dirty and unkept with long hair all over the place, piercings, and no form of uniform to tell them from the patrons. The women behind the bar were so scantilly clad that I felt more like I was in a gentleman's club than at a restaurant. If I had gone there with my son to eat, we probably would have had to leave because of all the ass cleavage and toe being flaunted. Gross. The food, steak and chicken kabobs, white rice, and mashed potatoes was so bland and void of seasoning if I wasn't starving, I would have left it. The \""appetizers\"" of chips and guac were stale, the pigs in a blanket were a little beneath my expectations and something I think I could have made at home. Oh well, not many places in that area stand the test of time and I predict this one will probably be gone soon too. There was one guy, I think the GM, that was very helpful with the TVs and spent time trying to find the game we wanted to watch. He was awesome. Everyone else kind of seemed like they didn't want to be working."
174	0	a	"I had the worst experience here recently due to the management.\nRead on to hear why I feel you should not give your business to Wasted Grain.\n\nI went here with a couple of my buddies. I ordered a draft beer and proceeded to the outdoor area. As I was heading out there a guy was walking past me quickly and knocked my beer out of my hand and it broke and spilled all over. I helped by picking the glass up and disposing of it. I tried to be polite and apologized to the guy who bumped me even though I believed it was his fault. As I went back to head back to be with my buddies I was about to wish the guy who bumped me a good night when he said with a snarky attitude \""watch where you are going next time\"". I was perturbed by his comment and gave him the bird for a second and started heading back to where my friends were.\n\nHere is where things get ridiculous. Apparently the guy who bumped my drink out of my hand unapologetically and was rude to me was a manager at the club. He followed me and summoned some bouncers. He said I needed to leave and the bouncers grabbed me by the arms and started shoving me towards the exit. I shook them off and told them I could leave without any assistance. They threw me on the ground face first and then proceeded to haul me out of the club. This was very embarrassing as it was my first time ever being thrown out of a club. I will not be returning here unless the owners apologize and at least reprimand the manager. This manager obviously was abusing his power and that is not acceptable."
175	1	a	Just awesome dancing to live music. Huge bar. Great menu. Lots of choices. Food and beer. Staff was very nice helpfull.
176	0	a	There was no lines when I showed up which was a great thing.\n\nHad to go back to buy a locker because was not asked . 4 stars.\n\nThere is no signs to lead to the bathrooms and the lockers 3 stars\n\nwas there for about 1 hour and 3 rides was closed down. 2 stars.\n\nThere is not enough tubes for each ride. 1 star\n\nI watched and  employee kick a tube rider multiple times to get them down a tube ride. I called her out on it she said sorry . But why say sorry for you knew that is not how you send someone down a ride. 0 stars. ( if i could )\n\nmanagement team could use a lot of work on how to run a park.
177	1	a	Took the whole family here today! Just a few things...\n\nEmployees need to engage- I was trying to talk to two of them (they made eye contact) and kept walking.\n\nWish condiments weren't left in the sun all day.... The ranch tasted funky by 5:30ish.\n\nChurros seemed old and stale.\n\nParking folks were super nice!\n\nFront ticketing agents were fantastic as were those checking the bags.\n\nI will return soon, but probably not until the other ride is finished with construction.
178	1	a	As a theme park and water park fan,\n\nI actually drove 4 hours from Los Angeles to check out the new Cowbunga Bay water park. which is located about 10 miles east of  the Vegas strip.\n\nI was a tad disappointed to learn before arriving that they are still in the process of constructing 2 or 3 water slides. I thought they have the whole last year and this year to complete the park. Oh well.\n\nSince the park is still missing 3 main attractions, they decided to lower the price by $6 for adult. \n\nAnyway, we went on a Thursday, a week after it opened. Parking was $5. I was expecting huge crowd like at Wet n Wild, but to my surprise it was no where as crowded as I had thought. Almost all the slides were a walk-on during the early morning into mid-afternoon hours. I overheard one of the lifeguards told the another guest that this was one of the slowest day since it opened a week ago. It may be due to the fact that it was cloudy and looked like it was going to rain.\n\nThe longest we waited for a slide was on Zuma ZOOMa. I would have to say this ride is the only extreme water slide in the park. It has a trap door underneath you, that will drop you in 5 seconds once you step in and they close the glass door. It was very thrilling. \n\nHere's a point of view video I shot of this Zuma ZOOMA trap door body slide:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMDqgckVUoo\n\nFood is a bit pricey since it's an amusement park. What do you expect? they need to make money somehow since most of the guests are season pass holder, they pay once and get to come back as often as they want. So in order to stay in business, they need to boost up their prices on food.\n\nOverall, I really enjoyed this park! It's so vivid and colorful. I can't wait to come back next summer when everything is completed and they have planted more trees and shrubs.  \n\nI don't know why, but I love Cowabunga Bay more than Wet N Wild Las Vegas. \n\nBy the way, here's a video showing a FULL Complete Tour of Cowabunga Bay Las Vegas for those who wants to see how it looks like before going\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmOs8Sc5tm0
179	1	a	We had a really fun time today, we arrived at 11 and left at 430 when the crowd came in. We never waited longer than ten minutes for a slide and the staff.. although all very young.. were all very helpful, respectful, considerate, and funny! So props to a good staff.\n\nThe part that killed me, and most yelpers were spot on, the park has a lonnnng way to go. The lack of shade is horrible. There's about 3/10 chairs that have shade because they use these tiny triangle coverings which end up shifting throughout the day. We had shade when we go there and by two we were full sun. \n\nThe tops of the slides are completely open. Your feet are burning.. One of the staff actually was pouring her ice water on the ground for us. I feel awful for the workers having to be way high up there with nothing protecting them! Also the lines before you walk up to the slides are completely open. There were four huge umbrellas in the grass shading no one.... Why not move one over and shade us people baking ??? \n\nBesides the shade the park is so nice. It's kept extremely clean and again the staff were super nice. The lazy river was okay, seemed super small especially compared to wet n wild. The wave pool on the other hand was awesome! HUGE waves. If there weren't so many people we would've been body surfing. And I was impressed how attentive the life guards were.\n\nThe slides were pretty fun, however the one that drops you down had me gasping for air. It ruined the ride for me. The yellow and pink slides were pretty fun. All were short but fun. \n\nOverall, the park need a few more months to work the kinks out. It's at a good start tho.\n\nPs. Souvenir cups. $9 and 1.50 refills
180	1	a	All of the staff is absolutely amazing, everyone is so nice and friendly!! Let's hope it keeps that way :) I really wish they'd lower their prices to get in earlier so we can actually go there more often.  I can't afford $160+ for a few hours of fun. If it was $20 all day every day for locals with ID, they would have much better business. I hope they will consider. \n\nFood is great. Chicken fingers were my favorite. \n\nFavorite ride...tide wave and river.\n\n I wish they had better signs posted near the water tide pool. I have seen a lot of little kids out there struggling deep in the waves, way beyond what they can handle and their parents cannot comprehend that!  I hope no one gets hurt.  Life jackets and tiny babies aren't suppose to be out that far.
181	0	a	"Absolutely the worst water park experience I have had. They clearly rushed to open this place the landscape isn't finish so there's rocks everywhere. Some of the cement is painted so when your feet are wet it's slippery and the stairs are plastic and very slippery when wet. The lines are extremely confusing and slow moving. There is one set of narrow stairs the leads up to 4 slides so it takes forever. They base the slides off of weight and constantly had to tell people they were too \""fat\"" to ride this ride and when you finally get to the top and go down the slide there is rubber stoppers to slow you down making the ride extremely just not fun. I will never recommend this park or go back it's just a terrible experience."
182	0	a	For the few rides they have it not worth the price the wave pool had junk in it like band aids and food wrapper in it the clean place in there was the bathroom
183	1	a	I'll start out by saying that this place can't rival Wet and Wild...yet. It currently has a very limited number of slides which didn't matter to us since, being in our 40's, that really isn't our thang' anymore. We were able to score a couple of season passes for 45$ each via Groupon and that makes this place the real deal. The Lazy River is nice (and unlike WnW, the water is warm) but what really rocks is the Wave Pool. \n    My girlfriend and I had an absolute blast in this thing. If you've ever been to the wave pool at Wet-n-Wild, this one is probably twice as strong, with swells up to thee feet...maybe higher. I'm a former body builder, I weigh around 235 lbs. and the current knocked me off my feet twice! My girlfriend is very small, so she sat in a tube while I held her ankles as the waves hit one after the other. By the time we got home her arms were aching from hanging on to the tube for dear life while my fucking legs were killing me from bracing against the current for an hour. Neither of us felt bad about skipping the gym this morning :) \n    The 35$ general admission is steep (IMO) for what they have right now, but if you can get a deal then I would try it just for the wave pool alone. Unlike WnW, tubes are free, and parking is only 5$, but the food is the same overpriced, unhealthy fare that is the bane of all amusement parks. You can bring in factory sealed water, which I would highly recommend. Shade is NOT plentiful, so plan accordingly.
184	1	a	I was so ecstatic when Henderson finally got a water park opened up! For as hot as it is here I couldn't believe it wasn't built sooner. I went to the old Wet N' Wild on Sahara when I was a kid and it sucked when it closed so to say the least I was really happy to see this place open up so close to home. \n\nI came here with the intention to buy a day pass to check the place out but it was going to cost $40 for just the day when a Super Pass that included parking was going to cost just $100 dollars. So we bought the Super Pass and have so far made the most of it. I've gone about 6 times since buying my pass. \n\nThe rides are a lot of fun. We go on the race slide most because you get on fairly quickly as it's a 6 person at a time ride. We love the Zumazooma slide too but it takes a little while to ride because it's only one person at a time. Zumazooma does have a weight restriction of 250 pounds and that tends to keep some people away for obvious reasons. There are 4 tube rides and they are quite fun as well. You can ride a 2 person tube or a 1 person tube. Not all of them allow 2 person tubes though. The tube rides usually have a lot of people in line so i don't bother with them too much.\n\nI've been in the kids area as a couple of my friends have children and it was nice for kids. They have a blast in there. Kids over a certain height can ride all the other rides also so they aren't too limited. \n\nThe wave pool is tons of fun. There is usually a lot of people in there because this is the only pool open to everyone at the whole park. Aside for it being pretty packed it's awesome. The lazy river is great also. My only real complaint about the lazy river is that it doesn't go too fast. It's a nice relaxing place though. \n\nThey have a pretty good selection of food, drinks, and desserts. They have Dole whip which i tried for the first time and it was great! The food pricing is a little expensive as expected but not too horrible. You can buy a good sized souvenir cup and get refills for like $1.50 which is a great price. The cup is pretty big and is only $9. Well worth it.  \n\nI give it four stars because the place closes pretty early and not all the rides are open yet. I asked a manager if they were going to extend the hours in the future and he said he had hopes of keeping the place open till midnight next year. That would be awesome if it were true. From what I understand there are 2 rides that are not up yet. I believe they said they would be open next year. If these 2 things were to happen i will definitely change my review from 4 stars to 5. \n\nTo say the least I am very happy with Cowabunga Bay! I will be buying Super Passes again next year!
185	0	a	We went yesterday to check it out, to compare it to Wet n Wild.  We were very disappointed. The standard of the park and employees was very poor. The employees seemed to only care about who was on break.  My husband was injured on 2 of the 4 rides.  On one of the rides a 5 year old little boy got stuck in the tube for over 5 minutes.  The attendant sent my husband down and he almost took out the boy.  He is 6'4 and 240,  he grabbed the boy and made it to the bottom.  These employees are just consumed with chatting and worrying about breaks.  I just don't see my kids as being safe at Cowabunga Bay.  The park itself seemed kind of cheap and poorly made.  The one plus there is the lazy river.  I guess we will continue driving across town to Wet n Wild.
186	1	a	The place is great! \n\nI Got a season passes for 2 years (2014 and 2015) for a total of $89 which is a great deal! \n\nAlso it's less than a 3 minute drive to the parking lot which is definitely a plus\n\nThe wave pool is the shizzzz and way better than wet and wild. Been here 3 times since it has opened and we have had a great time all occasions. \n\nThey don't have many rides but they are in process of building new ones. Looks like 2 if I'm not mistaken. \n\nBesides that it's great!
187	0	a	"Well.... If you like waiting in line, this is the right place for you.  I see a lot of comments about the wave pool.  I guess because it's one of the only rides that doesn't have a line. I have been there twice and both experiences were equally as bad.  Six hours at the water park and I was only able to ride three rides.  The park was at about 20% capacity and lines were 30-45 min each.  Their system is extremely flawed.  They will hold a ride for 10 minutes between passengers.  The first ride I was able to go down, I was held by a lifeguard standing in front of my raft at the top of the slide for over 7 minutes.  I asked when the last person was sent down the slide and he said \""about 10 minutes ago\"".  He had no answer to why they had to wait so long between riders.  There will be no one on two of the three larger slides that launch from the same platform and 60 people in line for the third. They won't allow passengers to change their mind and go down an empty slides, they would rather make everyone wait instead of keeping the flow going.  The ride will be clear for 2-3 minutes and as a anxious patron waiting in the hot sun it is a BIG waste of time.   I can't imagine what would happen if the park was full or even close to full.  It takes between 30-50 seconds to go down a slide. Why do they wait 8-10 min between riders???  I will never return.  They may have a good wave pool but for the price of admission, food and drinks, I'll trade a park that knows how to operate smoothly with an ok wave pool any day!"
188	0	a	I would never recommend this place to anyone. The staff and management were horrible and completely unhelpful. When I had an issue and spoke with the manager she just basically said, screw you, we've got your money and you're not getting it back. The facility was not that great and overall I was very disappointed with the park. Save your money and go somewhere else.
189	1	a	Great little juice bar just opened in adj Westmount just above A Votre Sante. Fresh juiced juices and smoothly, energy bars and salads. A great addition to the neighbourhood.
190	0	a	Stopped by on Sunday and was served by a guy who obviously couldn't care less. A stark contrast to my earlier visit. I ordered the same green juice but this one tasted terrible and I threw it out. Not a good sign when service and quality can vary so greatly!
191	1	a	I go to rejuice every morning to start my day! The service is awesome (cute too) , amazing fresh juices and such a variety! Great addition to Sherbrooke street.
192	1	a	A cute little bed and breakfast located right on the Allegheny River. They have pleasant landscaping, a covered indoor pool, hammock, chickens, and chairs right by the river to enjoy the view. I have not actually spent the night here, but would give it a try if I was coming to Pittsburgh. The only possible drawback is that it's located fairly close to Washington Boulevard, so there is some traffic noise on that side of the property.
193	1	a	From the moment we walked in the front gate, we were transported to a magical getaway only a few feet from civilization. Although we live only 10 minutes away, we wanted a special place to celebrate our anniversary...and Choderwood did not disappoint. We were warmly welcomed by hosts Jody and Steve before we settled in to the BoHo houseboat. We swam in the cool and refreshing quasi-greenhouse pool; we sat in the quiet and serene meditation hut; we relaxed in hammocks and floated on tree swings; we wandered on the stone paths; we explored the garden and chicken coop; and, we soaked in the hot tub. (The only thing we didn't manage to cram in was a bonfire by the river.) Having brought along a bag full of gourmet goodies and two bottles of wine, we spent the rest of our time just sitting on the roof of our boat simply enjoying the sights and sounds of boats on the river and a sunset on the horizon. The BoHo offered many nooks and crannies for sitting and sleeping, as well as everything we needed in the kitchen and bathroom to make our time away from home feel like second nature. We left calm, rejuvenated, and happy. Words cannot express how much we loved our mere 20 hours at Choderwood. I want to, alternately, tell everyone and no one about Choderwood, as I want our friends to experience this Pittsburgh Narnia but I wish we could keep it as our own little secret. We hope to always find occasions--or, no reason at all--to visit again!
194	0	a	Horrible.. Worst Starbucks I have been in a long time and it has been awhile. Names were not written. All three drinks made wrong and no apologies
195	0	a	HORRIBLE!!!!!!!!!! Waited a half hour for my drink, the ten people in line behind me got theirs. I said what the F*ck??? Oh they were extremely rude to me and took their sweet time getting me a refund. Will NEVER go back. Rude employees. Slow horrible service.
196	0	a	Worst Starbucks I have ever been to. Waited for just under 30 minutes for an iced chai. People that came after me got their drink way before I did. I had to remind the barista about my drink 3 times and then they tell me that there is not even an order put in for an iced chai, so then I had to go talk to the cashier about my order. 27 minutes later, I get my iced chai. I am NEVER going back to that location. I had a simple drink and it took that long, imagine if I had a complicated drink, I probably would have waited an hour. \n\nWorst part is that it was not only me having a bad experience there. All the people waiting for their drink all said that this Starbucks was the worst ever.
197	1	a	Love this place. We visited Glasgow site last summer after hearing about it and and were super delighted to hear of Edinburgh opening, ON THEIR FIRST BIRTHDAY too! We just randomly arrived when we could, which happened to be 3.30-4pm on a Thursday, so it wasn't busy, but we didn't want a busy place so suited us! They've done great things with the space (much improved and simplistic) and actually we instantly found the chilli fries and wings to be superior to Glasgow...the burgers (fiery ones) were delicious but the actual meat alone was dry and overcooked slightly..Altogether it was still a brill tasty burger experience and you could tell the meat was good, but it had turned kind of grey and dry and we were super glad of all the accompaniments....\n\nWe were charged extra for bacon we didn't ask for, but we DID ask for cheese so didn't say anything at bill time, though only one of us got cheese and both got bacon - pretty strange mistakes for an empty restaurant...\n\nBut we heart new indy places owned by enthusiastic-hard-working individuals who just want to get the message across that their product is simple, delicious and affordable. We'll be back....again and again!!!!!
198	1	a	"Burgers are in vogue right now. Well, I don't know if they ever went out of vogue, but I'm certainly not complaining. For a while, British gastro-pub burgers were all the rage: one's so big you had to cut them in half with a knife and fork then risk lock-jaw in order to get your mouth around the burger, bun, three toppings and onion rings included. That was \""our\"" type of Burger here on our wee Isle.\n\nBut then something changed, and Americana came over to the burger scene, taking us back to the way burgers used to be. Thin but no less flavourful or satisfying. And to be honest, i prefer them this way. Who thought bigger meant better when it came to burgers, when you literally can't fit it in your mouth for a bite, or finish it with chips without carrying food triplets for a few days after?\n\nSo, Burger Meats Bun is the newest addition to the Edinburgh burger-scene, nicely carrying on the American-style burger trend. The burgers are filling and the patties are still juicy, but it's more American style, complete with thin fries and milkshakes on the menu, and the food coming wrapped in paper on a metal tray. \n\nThe burger here was really tasty. And they do gluten free buns! Hurrah! And their gluten free buns are the best I've tasted in the city. Yey! The kim-cheese chips were SO good too, although laden in cheese, but that's the point right?\n\nThe dessert of dunkable donut bits with salted caramel sauce with added bourbon was mmmm far too good, and then dark n stormy cocktails were very well made.\n\nI think I would prefer to see a few more options of toppings on the menu. I like that its simple: beef, cheese, chicken, veggie, and a few specials (not 20 different options) but a few other relishes or sauces to add variety to the burger would be a nice addition.\n\nA great place for a mid week dinner, and with good cocktails, desserts and milkshakes to boot. Viva Americana burgers!"
199	1	a	"So when I moved here and heard that burgers were the new \""it\"" thing in Edina's culinary world, I thought, \""Cccooollll...\"" *insert skeptical baby gif here*\n\nI mean really, how hard is it to put a slab of meat between two pieces of bread and call it a good time? Turns out... not that hard. But to put a slab of meat between two pieces of bread and call it hallelujah? Well deal friends, turns out, that's a gosh darn burger art.\n\nOk. I'm in. I throw my full support behind this burger obsessed town, because ladies and gentleman - the Scots know how to make em. What makes a burger hallelujah worthy in the great city of Edina? Well first off - it starts with a glass. You heard me, a glass. I got to BMB late after being caught in a torrential downpour on my walk over. I sat down and ordered a beer - 1 minute later (service ninja points), the world's greatest beer glass hit our table.\n\nHonestly, I have no idea how they frost the glasses here - as made apparent by my frequent fails to reenact this moment in my own kitchen - but they are icy, frosty, receptacles of joy. No matter what you're drinking, it will undoubtably be better in this tiny, glass wonder.\n\nBut onto the main event - I ordered myself a Smokin Bacon: house smoked bacon, spicy ketchup, BMB burger sauce and braised onions. This is a SOLID burger. It's big, it's messy and it's delicious. Definitely a perfect rainy day, food coma causing sort of meal.\n\nWe added a side of haggis popcorn - because what goes better with meat than more meat. In fact, by the urging of my cohort in crime Paddy H, this happened to be my FIRST delve into the world of haggis and sir, I tip my hat to you for making me take the haggisy plunge. I'm not sure why everyone is so scared of this stuff - it's like meaty pat\u00e9, and you guessed it - pretty damn delicious.\n\nThe only part of the meal I might skip next time around was the thai chilli cheese fries. They are tasty, without a doubt but smaller than I imagined and kind of ho-hum as I was expecting something significantly more fancy. It's chips with cheese and fresh chillis. A little lemongrass would go a long way here.\n\nBut it was a minor blip in an otherwise stellar, comfort food cracking meal. The best part? With three beers a piece (maybe four?), two burgers, two sides and two desserts, this meal came out to an amazingly reasonable \u00a324ish. Not bad for a meal that left me full until the next day's lunch.\n\nI will definitely be back next time a burger and beer calls. But until then, I leave you with this pro tip: Extra bacon. Always extra bacon."
200	0	a	"Have to say I am super bummed. Guess I got spoiled at the queen Creek location so maybe my expectations were higher than they should have been. That said let me tell you the positives: place was relatively clean although we did need our table cleaned before we could sit down. The staff was welcoming, pleasant and helpful and the food came out pretty quickly - interesting that they delivered each dish when it was ready vs the whole order at once.  So with all the good so far what went wrong right?  Well it was the food. I ordered a create your own - as I always do - and while the burger was hot in temperature that was all the good I can share. The lettuce was limp and barely covered the bun, there was almost no sauce,  the pickles and jalape\u00f1os were very small - not like at the qc spot when you get big thick junks of crisp vegetables - and the burger could not have been greasier. Now I have a major problem with wet bread and not only did I go threw a bunch of napkins trying to dry off the bun and patty but there was actually a puddle in my plate before I could even finish. Had I ordered take out I wouldn't have had anything good to share about the experience. Oh and lastly the constant \""bugging\"" if things can be taken away made me feel like I needed to hurry up and get out. Super bummed."
201	0	a	Very disappointed! My husband and mother went to go pick up burgers for dinner.. Since I am 9 months pregnant and not in the mood to go eat out somewhere. They ordered our food and brought it home. They neglected to  give them all of the orders and we didn't realize this until they got home. To top it off it was my order they left out! The milkshake we got basically was this... Flavored milk... And for charging $4 something for the Oreo chocolate shake that is unacceptable! So my husband is  enroute to go fix the issue meanwhile his dinner is getting cold! We tried to call the store and no one answers but it gives you an option to speak with headquarters.. What good will that do?! Ugh. Will most likely not be returning to this smash burger!
202	0	a	Meh. Service was friendly.  The burger patty did not seem to have any seasoning. The haystack onion straws were good but served very greasy, the bottom half of the order was not edible due to the amount of oil.  Sweet potatoe fries were great. I did not find the product worth the price and would rather save a few bucks and go to In n' Out or spend a few more and go to a full service restaurant.
203	1	a	Have been wanting to try this place out for some time now!  I had a smash burger $4.99 and the smash fries $1.99 and both were really good.  The smash fries are my favorite for sure, they are the skinny fries and they are made with olive oil and rosemary....VERY good!   there were four of us and we all had fries and burgers.  Two had the chocolate shake and they were quite delish as well.  The bill came to $35 prob cause the shakes alone were $4 each.  Compared to an in and out this was far better...IMO.
204	0	a	Wow!  After all the great reviews we were so excited to try Smashburger.  What a disappointment.  My chicken mushroom sandwich was a greasy salt lick.  My husbands burger was also really salty and doesn't hold a candle to Habit Burger.  Over priced for what it is.  Fry's were very good.  Parking sucked.  We need a Habit Burger closer than I-10 and Ray Road.
205	1	a	Love the food.  My son devoured his burger so fast I'm not sure he even tasted it, lol.   Next time, I will get the dressing on the side.  Way too much was poured on my salad leaving the bottom looking like a bowl of soup but that was my fault.  I forgot to ask for the dressing on the side.  Will definitely come again.    \n\nDon't let the name fool you.  They have salads, shakes/malts, chicken sandwiches,  grilled cheese, hot dogs, chicken nuggets.  Black bean burgers.  Definitely well rounded.
206	1	a	I really like this place for many reasons. One main is that unlike another delicious burger place, you can order chicken! I'm sure it's not as healthy as I wish it were but it makes me feel a little better about eating fast food. The fries are delicious and the smash sauce is something to write home about (thinner thousand island?) bomb. I'm always coming back and this particular location is clean and quick with service
207	0	a	I had the avocado club regular burger with sweet potato fries and a vanilla shake. The burger needed some seasoning, fries were good and the shake was watery. Burger King shakes are much better. For the price, I'd rather go pick up a burger at Blue 32.
208	0	a	Yikes, very disappointed. Our first visit and our last.\n\nPro's - Friendly staff, clean\n\nCon's - Salty, salty, salty. Hamburgers, cheeseburgers, onion haystacks, fried    pickles were salty, salty, salty. Chicken Avocado Club  - chicken was pounded paper thin, couldn't even taste it. Only tasted the salty bun and lettuce.\n\nThe parking lot isn't big enough to accomodate the 5 restaurants it services, 6 if you count Starbucks. \n\nSo, don't waste your time. You'll get a better tasting meal at Burger King or Wendy's.
209	0	a	2 srars for the onion rings, they were the only good thing. First let me say it was busy so that may be why it seemed so disorganized.  Had to ask for ice for the machine ( no biggie there). Then had to ask if they could clean one of the empty tables so we could sit. Table and condiments had crusted food on them even after cleaning (yuck). Order comes out wrong, had items on it that I had asked to be left off and meat was way undercooked. Bathrooms were nasty and out of TP. I didn't complain about any of it because I got the feeling that none of the kids working there would care much. If the burger had been good all could have been forgiven but it was just blah. Not returning.
210	1	a	Javi is great! I was new to vaping and he took the time to show us the different kits and styles. They have great Ejuices that they mix in house and the pricing was fair. They also have some sweet Jdm air fresheners! Its a nice store in the Scottsdale area with a chill atmosphere.  Stop by and enjoy mixing some of your own juice!
211	1	a	Best vape shop in the valley,  best prices,  best costumer service.  I'll never go anywhere else.
212	1	a	Saw this on yelp and decided to check it out. So happy I did because these guys are fantastic. They had knowledge of every product and even make custom vape flavors for you while your waiting. The possibilities are endless with these guys. Great prices too.
213	1	a	I love this place. Great dogs and  great beer selection.Make sure to try the Grandfather, one of the best Hot dogs I've ever had. Highly recommend it.\nI can't wait to go back!
214	1	a	First time here at Chefinis and we were really impressed! They have some very unique hot dogs and the taste was pretty great. The beef hot dog is very hearty and juicy. The buns were soft. The toppings were fresh. Definitely recommend. \n\nThe only reason for the 4 stars instead of 5 was due to the price. It's pretty expensive for a hot dog. All in I got The Grand Father dog, a side of fries (which were huge, definitely shareable) and a cup of water and it cost me $14. To be fair, I'm looking at the menu right now and it looks like The Grand Father dog is the most expensive one at $9. I think the price is mainly due to it being located in the container park, and everything is a bit pricier in here. \n\nOverall, definitely recommend it!
215	0	a	Food is ok but I dont see why it takes 20min plus to get a kids hotdog.  Worst service.. itsxsucked as pork n bean container and its sucks now as cheffinis.  Its so sad it could be a great place if the owner knew whats what and trained his staff.  The countergirl could not take my ordrr cuz she was counting by er drawer and other ppl were waiting on food and did not pay either cuz she was counting. Tastes ok executed poorly.
216	1	a	We get a hot dog almost everywhere we go especially if it's unique, we had to go with The Grand Father...it was just over flowing with toppings. The hot dog itself was nothing all that special and the bun didn't stand up too well to all those toppings but the combo of all those different flavors and textures (mango, spicy mayo, pork belly, potato chips, etc) was well worth it. \nThe prices are steep $8.99 for our dog but it's to be expected in a touristy and trendy section of Downtown LV. \nStaff was friendly and helpful, our food came out pretty fast even on a busy Sunday.
217	1	a	Great food, great service! If you are looking for a unique quick treat while shopping, these dogs are for you! I tried the Crispy Dog... Who thought seaweed and crushed potato chips would be great on a dog?! Next time I bring the fam, I'm trying the Grandfather. Keep up the great work!
218	1	a	The ham and cheese croissant sandwich was a great on-the-go breakfast. Despite the line/ crowd, everyone was pleasant and orderly, and made crepes, coffees, and sandwiches with efficiency and ease. It's nice to know that my croissant sandwich was made fresh instead of just extracted from the display case and heated up. Definitely recommended for a quick pick-me-up.
219	1	a	Located in the food court off the casino floor of the Venetian.  Offering the perfect mix of gelato, crepes, and coffee.  You can make your sweet tooth happy at this little food stall.\n\nI stopped in for dessert tonight, but will try them for breakfast next time.\n\nNice selection of gelato including my favorites mango and coconut! Very creamy, the coconut gelato  actually has shredded coconut inside!  $7 for 2 scoops in a cup.  Not too bad in the new Vegas.\n\nThe smell of fresh crepes is awesome with both sweet and savory option available. Will update this review next time after I try them.\n\nPlus your favorite espresso based coffee drinks.\n\nThey are in the same location as Cocolini but have changed the name.

221	1	a	Great customer service!! And the sauces and wings....on point!! Had the tequila lime and the DC famous mumbo. Definitely going back to try the rest of the flavors. The house dressing is real good too!! Gracias Armando!!
222	1	a	I absolutely love this place.  First time was great,  second time is amazing!  You can get almost anything you can think of its great munchie food n the owner is so cool.
223	0	a	First and last ordering here. I ordered a wing meal that should have come with a soda and fries, I paid an extra dollar for it and they didn't put it in there. I asked for wings only no drums and they had to call me because they did t know what I meant... so I said the flat ones... He still didn't understand what I meant... you work at a wing place... you should know what the hell I mean. I've never had an issue anywhere else with this request.  Now I also request ranch for everything I ordered and got all blue cheese. The fries looked brown as if they were cut and weren't soaked in water so they wouldn't turn brown and nasty. They had no flavor. Now my wings I ended up getting boneless because they couldn't understand what I wanted. I ate one of each flavor and threw it out. I could have bought frozen boneless wings and had them taste and look the same. I have no clue how this place has such great reviews.  Oh and they delivered it 20 minutes late. Never ever again.
224	0	a	one star is too much.  they are horrible - awful - the worst bucket of bolts in the sky spend the extra $50 for an airline that won't break your luggage, delay every flight or cancel it all together, and for one that won't charge for water and treat you like sh!#.  They have the worse customer service at the airport, on the phone, in their corporate offices you may save a few dollars but you will always be disappointed with your experience. NEVER FLY WITH ALLEGIANT AIR
225	1	a	"While driving home yesterday, I spotted a new place.  This place seemed to just POP up!  Went home and grabbed the wife for some healthy grub.  When we arrived we were greeted by a nice guy who introduced us to the menu and told us that the place just opened that afternoon.  He recommended a few things off of the menu and we went up to order.\n\nAt the counter, I ordered the steak, tomatoes, and potatoes and my wife ordered the veggie burger.  There were a few hiccups at the counter, but that could be expected being a brand new restaurant.  No worries for us.  The waitress told us that there was an \""grand opening party\"" going on and that we could sit anywhere we could find a seat.  \n\nThe steak, tomatoes, and potatoes and the veggie burger were great.  Saying all that, there was one issue, the restaurant was incredibly hot, and probably because the there were so many people there.  The food was delicious, so it made up for it.  Near the end of the meal, a waitress asked if we wanted dessert.  We had the chocolate cookie, which was warm and delicious.\n\nGreeters - 5 Stars\nWait staff/counter - 3 Stars (new girl in a new restaurant)\nFood - 4 Stars\nDessert - 4 Stars\nAmbiance - 2 Stars (because of the heat)\nPricing - $$\n\nOverall - 4 Stars (Lyfe Kitchen could easily be 5 stars)"
226	0	a	"All the food I tried was disappointing and flavorless. I ordered the dish they are \""known for\"" the unfried chicken and the chicken penne. Because the unfried chicken is placed on top of the cashew cream it was slightly soggy. The cashew cream sauce was bland and the vegetables were undercooked. The chicken penne was even more bland than the unfried chicken. The presentation was sloppy and unappetizing. I was surprised the sauce was advertised as a cream sauce because it was watery. The vegetables were all different sizes which makes me question the knife skills of the prep cook. The pasta was so over cooked that I had trouble picking it up with my fork.\n\nOverall, the food here is poorly executed and under seasoned."
227	0	a	Unfortunately, I will not be able to rate the food as I was not able to taste it. I drove by this restaurant and unsure of the hours, checked the website as it was nearing 9:00pm. The website did not list the closing hours, just the opening date and time. As this is a new restaurant, I thought it would be worth checking out. I walked in the doors at 9:02pm and noticed that it was still quite busy with many tables seated. The gentlemen at the counter advised that the restaurant closed at 9:00pm. I mentioned that I checked the website and the also that the door did not list the closing hours, just the opening time. His response was to recite the opening and closing hours for the remainder of the week. I asked if I could just order a salad to go and I wouldn't require anything to be cooked. He proceeded to tell me that the kitchen had actually closed early and they couldn't make anything......further contradicting his statement of a 9:00pm closing time. He then asked if I would like to take a to go menu? I didn't want a to go menu, I just wanted a bed of lettuce and dressing, which apparently is as difficult to accommodate for a new business as a clearly stated closing time. I won't be back.
228	0	a	stopped in the minute I spotted the place. fake chicken burger was fabulous. Fish tacos were a bit over baring  .  Salad was a waste of time. cucumber, mint water was very good. However there were no prices so the total was a shock! Not sure I'll go back
229	1	a	Cool ambience, inside is really open and clean. I liked the herbs wall and cute wooden tables. My fianc\u00e9 and I had the mint cucumber water, margherita pizza, chunky guacamole, farmers market salad and grain bowl. The pizza was nice and light, guacamole and salsa were really good (not the chips it came with though), the salad looked nice and summer-y with black berries, candied walnuts, goat cheese and arugula. The balsamic vinaigrette was not over bearing on the salad. The grain bowl had a nice spice to it. The menu has prices and also indicates that veggies are undercooked to be nice and crunchy texture. Overall, we enjoyed the meal and great hospitality. We will be going back.
230	0	a	The staff is friendly, definitely a positive! The portions were good sized, but seemed pre-made. My husband and I enjoy a healthy lifestyle, but the food was a disappointment. The sweet potato fries were cold and soggy. I ordered the pizzadilla and it was ok, nothing special. My husbands burger seemed like it can from a supermarket pre made bag and was cold. I may come back in a few months to see if it improves, but was not thrilled.
231	0	a	"I was not impressed by anything here upon entering you are presented a menu which you read while standing in line. This is not a good idea for elderly folk. I prefer to sit when I read the menu. The staff seemed as though they all just left a pep meeting way too much  smiling it all seemed fake I ordered the fish tacos I received 2 appetizer sized tacos with perfectly cut rectangle pieces of fish, which were also quite bland tasting. My friend ordered the chicken sandwich it came on a oatmeal bun which was dry as.. Well you know, she said it crumbled apart in her mouth. Leaving most of it on the plate, not a good sign considering we were there on the second day they were open. The district manager explained my fish was dry possibly because \""the flavor may have come off before cooking as the fish was pre-seasoned."
232	1	a	Lots of variety; extensive gluten free menu. Lots of healthy options to choose from and I love that you can go through their dietary catalog and see each menu item and a break down of their nutrition.  Only downside was that I got an entree and a side and was still a little hungry after.
233	1	a	Love that there is a clean, fresh and actually healthy fast food option in Henderson! The food is like I would make at home- maybe not the most flavorful, but its clean and good for you which is what counts!
234	0	a	"Seriously shocked, appalled, and  disappointed. \n\nI ordered a \""berry bowl\"" for my staff from the catering menu ($35) and the staff was very kind and willing to help get my order done quickly which I very much appreciated. \n\nUpon opening the bowl, there were orange wedges and grapes beneath which were some strawberries, blackberries and a few blueberries and then three whole unpeeled unopened bananas. I found this to be distasteful, unsanitary, and embarrassing.  I would expect this from a low end grocer not from here."
235	0	a	Food was horrible, very bland with no taste and way overpriced.  I got the burger and it was one of the worst ones I have ever had.  I really wish I took a picture to show how bad it looked.  Also beware as they don't server soda.   I would not recommend this place to anyone.
236	0	a	I eat vegan and was so excited about this new restaurant. I had the quinoa crunch wrap and was underwhelmed. The distribution of ingredients was uneven and therefore, half the wrap was quite bland while the other half gushed out the flavorful hummus spread. I prefer the felafel vegan wraps at Zikis on the other side of the 215 freeway. Or load up on the salad bar at Whole Foods ($2 off per lb every Wednesday). My quinoa wrap was overpriced considering the serving size. Also, the vibe of the restaurant seemed a bit pretentious!
237	0	a	"I was looking forward to trying this spot but I left the location extremely disappointed. I'm an easy-going guy who usually doesn't complain, but the service was slow, the staff was unfriendly, and the food was mediocre.\n\nI also found it perplexing this place doesn't serve soda even though it offers coffee, tea, beer, wine, juices and smoothies. I'm sure it's because \""Lyfe Kitchen\"" hails itself as a healthy dining option, but how do you offer beer and wine but not soda? \n\nThe self-serve water station also lacks an ice machine and simply offers a small bucket of ice that only had 3 ice cubes inside during my visit. This isn't Europe, people! We Americans like our ice -- especially here in Vegas when it's 110 degrees outside... \n\nAnd while I'm no food and beverage expert, wouldn't this community ice bucket be a health code violation? What's there to prevent some sick guy from using his dirty hand to grab some ice directly from the bucket? \n\nOf larger importance than the lack of soda or ice, however, was the disappointing food... I shared a bunch of different items with three others and we had an issue with almost everything we ordered, starting with the sweet potato garlic Parmesan fries. They were limp, mushy, greasy and literally laying in a puddle of garlic oil. With that amount of oil, I highly doubt the fries contained the actual calorie count advertised on the menu.\n\nThe Buffalo chicken wrap also had no \""kick\"" whatsoever and it was easily the blandest Buffalo wrap I've ever tasted. The staff also failed to ask us how we wanted the grass-fed burger cooked -- so it ended up being boring AND overcooked -- and the ingredients of the quinoa crunch wrap weren't evenly distributed. As a result, one bite would be all quinoa tabbouleh, the next bite would be all vegetables, etc.\n\nI might give \""Lyfe Kitchen\"" one more try, but everyone in my group agreed that it's no \""Greens & Proteins.\"""
238	1	a	Being located in the district comes with certain expectations. It better be nice, it better be good AND you are probably going to pay a little more.\n\nLYFE Kitchen meets all 3 criteria. \n\nThe wife and I have come here a couple of times now. The food is good and healthy. There are ample choices however unlike some other places they dont have calories listed. They have a nice selection of items though. I liked the burger choices. \n\nAlso, they give you an option of sparkling, ambient and ice water! Perfect for me and perfect for her!
239	0	a	Went with a friend to sample dishes from this new establishment.  I had the garlic cheese sweet potato - arrived warm, soggy, and greasy. Dipping sauce was tasty. \nThen I had their Kale Caesars salad - arrived cool, crisp and tasteless. Dressing was not to my liking. To another palate, the blandness of the dressing might be fine. Salad itself had a mix if broccoli florets, lettuce stems, kale leaves, and since I included chicken. Chicken was skinless, breast, cubed, grilled and dry.\nI also ordered the chicken wd penne and mushrooms and spinach.  Again,  it is a sauce my palate is not used to. So for me, it was bland and flavorless. Recipes probably used the vegan version of mayonnaise or cream. \nIf one eats enough of this type of cuisine,  the palate will get used to it.\nBut for me,  I shall not be returning. \nMy friend's fish tacos were tasty. Dressing on the side salad was tart and clean tasting. The salsa was also seasoned differently,  but good.
240	0	a	"Well, first and foremost, the food has an extremely bland taste. We ordered the hummus, buffalo chicken wrap and penne pasta. 75% into eating the wrap I came across a long, thick string in my mouth in which I thought was an onion or something.  I pulled it out and turns out it was a piece of fabric string, most likely from the chef's shirts being that it was the same color as their outfits. Now, I proceed to tell a food runner about the string and he takes it from me and says, \"" I'll take care of it.\"" 10/15 minutes later the runner is nowhere to be found and I had to catch him on the way back from the bathroom and asked what he was going to do about the situation. He replied, \""well would you like me to refire it again? I'll get a manager...\"" So instead of asking me this right away, he walked away and forgot about me. So I see him tell the manager about my situation who is polishing silver. About 7 minutes later she decides to put down the silverware and come talk to us about what happened instead of with urgency upon hearing the news from the runner. Nice to know the silverware was of more importance than my dilemma. Yeah I'm never coming back here..."
241	0	a	"A restaurant that targets its customers seeking healthy eats does a good job providing signs depicting clean food; however, their food clearly does not reflect healthy eats.  Now based on one dish alone might not be fair to the restaurant but all of your foods should hold the same standard.\n\nI got the morning tofu wrap and figured that this would probably be one of the healthier options on their breakfast menu.  The food runner comes up to my table saying \""here\"" but i didn't move and waited until he placed it himself.  The food was extremely oily as illustrated on the photos I took of it.  Portions were tiny and about the size of my credit card per half.  Although I can't slam the place on the taste of the food (which was actually not bad) I felt like i could go to chipotle and spend the same amount but get more food that is equally as bad/oily. \n\nThe decor is beautiful.  The main area to eat is very wide, spacious and open.  This restaurant offers complimentary water of three variants but I found the sparkling to be quite nice (comparable to perrier). \n\nOverall: Portion size, questionable healthiness of the food really test whether I will return."
242	1	a	"First time at Lyfe. \n\nPros - had the grassfed burger it tasted great . Didn't have all the preservatives and other crap other burgers are made with (Mando burger from Good Burger) haha\nVery clean place ,friendly staff, and nice ambience. Lots of menu options for healthy eating. Pricing was fair \n\nCons-  came off as \""kinda\"" Hollywood. Their was some saddity , uppity, snobby people in there. I saw some botched plastic surgery patients In there. I swear a guy sitting right next to my table looked like \""Bruce Jenner\"" . I decided to have a beer with my healthy burger because well I CAN DAMNIT ! But a few patrons gave me the odd look because it wasn't 12pm yet haha  \n\n\n\nEither way,  great experience I'll give them a second chance."
243	0	a	Went here for lunch today to give it a try. To sum it up: Way overpriced, small portions, super slow service. \n\nArrived about 11:00 and it wasn't very busy. We ordered chips & guacamole, fish tacos and the chicken sandwich. It was just under $30 with no drinks.\n\nAs other reviews mention you order at a counter like your at a fast food place. We waited and waited for the food. It wasn't busy in there but took way too long for what we ordered. \n\n The guacamole was pretty good but the chips were very hard. It was $6.95 for the same size you get at Chipotle for half the cost.\n\nThe fish tacos were just one piece of fish on a corn tortilla with some cabbage thrown on top. $9.99. The chicken sandwich was ok and said it came with a side salad. It was a couple pieces of greens with hardly any dressing.  Was not impressed with Lyfe kitchen at all.
244	1	a	I've had the fish tacos... Really good, and the kale Cesar salad with salmon... Really really good! I love that it's super healthy and the calories are on the menu. The only reason it didn't get a 5 is because there's no soda! It's a little over-priced too but I'll eat here when I feel like being very healthy.
245	0	a	"Vegetarian and Vegan options make LYFE worth trying if you fall in that category but there are hang ups if you are a carnivore\n\nI believe that if you fall into that non meat eater category, this is a place that you would definitely enjoy.  It does have a large menu that caters to the gluten fee nuts, the vegans/vegetarians as well as a menu for the rest of us.  However, the items I had on the \""rest of us\"" menu didn't leave me tasting for more.   I thought the seasonal special (Chicken and Black Bean Bowl) that I had was just...ok.  The chicken wasn't anything special and with a few pieces of avocados, jalape\u00f1os, and peppers didn't really turn this into something I would order again.  I'm ok with spicy which this was but give me some taste to go with all that spice!  We tried the guacamole and chips as well but again nothing blew me away.  Chips were on super crunch mode and very hard.  The Guacamole tasted the same and was on par with Chipotle.  My wife had the fish tacos that she let me try and just wasn't a fan.  It has a bit of that fish after taste which I do not like.   Good, fresh fish tacos shouldn't have that taste in my opinion.  Along with 1 drink (hibiscus iced tea which was very good) our two entrees and app, ran about 33 bucks which is a bit on the pricey end for me.   \n\nConclusion - probably wouldn't eat here again on my own but when my vegetarian boss comes to town and we're looking for a lunch time spot, I'll probably bring him by just for the vegetarian offerings alone."
246	1	a	Yum, shakalaka! \nI have been here 4 times now and its slowly making its way into a regular stand by place when I just don't feel like cooking. \n\nFor me it meets the 3 main reasons I  going anywhere to eat: \nThe food tastes good. Check\nMakes something I won't bother with at home. Check\nIs healthy. Check\n\nOnce I got a hang of the ordering system I really liked this place.
247	0	a	"I really, really love healthy food done right. The kind of food that breaks down the barriers between us crazy health nuts and the traditional awful eaters around the world. The kind of food that says, \""it's alright, see? I can be healthy and delicious!\"" If you want this experience, go to Native Foods Cafe in southern California, not LYFE Kitchen.\n\nWell, like any good story, we need a setting. Henderson. The District. Whole Foods shopping center. High end high end high end. This is a high end health-oriented cafe so the price is high, too. I am not going to mention specific numbers, but even in the world of high-end cafes, there should be a sense of value.\n\nIt starts well. The interior is beautifully modern and polished. Comfortable and plentiful seating in a large space. A display of herbs and spices growing immediately catches your eye - which will provide some irony later. Filtered water available on tap at any time. Staff is extremely friendly and helpful. There are menus for every dietary need. Thoughtful! Now, let's get into the food.\n\n- Roasted brussels and squash. A side dish that hides nothing in its name. This is, weirdly, the best thing I've had here. It's those two vegetables tossed and cooked in light oil and spices with cranberries thrown on top. Simple and high in value.\n\n- Barramundi noodle bowl. The honest, forward name in the last dish is contrasted to the cryptic name here. I'm going to copy the exact description. \""Sustainably raised seabass with soba noodles, mushrooms, scallions, edamame, in kimchi broth.\"" Yes, all of those ingredients are present - but what do you picture this dish looking like? A noodle bowl with a fish on top? Wrong. Try some weak broth with about 8 noodles floating in it with accompanying (and sparse) edamame, kimchi, and mushrooms. A cooked piece of fish on top. This just makes no sense. There is no distinct character or flavor to this. No purpose or personality. It's just food. Low in value because you essentially just paid for a piece of fish.\n\n- Grass-fed burger. So, again, technically everything on the list checks out. \""100% grass-fed beef, romaine, tomato, red onion, farmhouse pickle,  dijonnaise on an oatmeal bun.\"" You can expect a lot of bread containing a relatively small, unseasoned, and remarkably dry beef patty topped with extremely sparse amounts of lettuce and tomatoes. Seriously, where is everything? And why is the patty so awful? Oh yeah, this comes with a tiny \""salad.\"" Extremely, extremely low value.\n\n- Fish tacos. Hey, fish tacos! What can possibly go wrong here? These actually taste alright but mainly because they're drenched in sauce. Thin pieces of fish topped with lots of vegetables with a bit of salsa on the side. Same borderline-garnish grade \""salad\"" on the side. Fish tacos are often delicious because of the combination of fresh fish topped with crunchy vegetables (like cabbage) and a light sauce. The effect was lost in that sense. Perhaps four tacos would be a bit more appropriate for the price and considering there is almost nothing else on the plate. Again, super low in value.\n\n- LYFE waters. Not bad, but quite watered down. I'm not even going to get into it.\n\nSo, a conclusion then? Potential, yes. Execution, poor. I just can't justify coming back and paying a high price for not much in both value and flavor (all their spices are growing up front instead of being used in the kitchen). I guarantee you'll leave hungry and poor."
248	1	a	First bites today and thought it was dynamite.  Shared the fish tacos and the farmers market salad...they were both delicious.  Thrilled to have it in the neighborhood.
249	1	a	LYFE Kitchen is typical california cuisine.  I had the Fish Tacos, and they were quite enjoyable.  I'm not usually as big of a fan as Fish Tacos as my friend, Mr. Booth (Mr. Booth LOVES Fish Tacos).  They were served with 2 tacos and a very small salad.  I think that the menu said it was about 400 calories, so it left me a little big hungry still.  For the price of $13, it was a bit expensive.\n\nI also had an orange ginger drink that was good, but the jelly inside was a little bit weird.  A coworker of mine had the Grilled Chicken Sandwich with avocado, which he really enjoyed.  I think that I may try that next.\n\nLYFE kitchen will be a repeat, but not too often of a repeat.  It's probably really about 3.5 stars, but we'll round up for the good service.
250	0	a	The restaurant decor is beautiful and well done, very fresh. The menu options are really well portioned and healthy. There are plenty vegetarian and gluten free options.\n\nI have been here numerous times and have tried very hard to like it. The main downfall is the logistical issues with food service and breakfast/lunch hours. Breakfast stops sharply at 11, despite the person in front of you taking 20 minutes to order a juice. So if you're in line, be prepared with multiple options. Sometimes the management walks the queue with updates on what they are out of. Lately it's been eggs and potatoes, despite these being ingredients in many menu items. It's very disappointing.\n\nCustomer service folks are super nice and well uninformed, but they lack the resources to succeed since kitchen to table service is slow and the electronic table markers do not work. Servers pace the whole restaurant with your food, asking random guests what their number or order was.\n\nI want this beautiful place to work, but you need a lot of patience and time to go here.
251	0	a	The stars are for the food.  The order process is long and orders take forever after being placed. I have been here several time day and night and it never changes. Service is bad as well last time I came I waited in line so long I left, the girl at the register has to take phone orders as well as guest orders. My visit prior to that they brought out my girls food, and then mine 30 minutes later after I asked about it. \n\nIt seems to start at the top. Usually the managers are just standing around socializing with the staff, I have witnessed this on several occasions. \n\nThe only thing bringing me back is the food.
252	1	a	We used Lyfe kitchen as a caterer for our wedding at the Mandalay Bay Hotel. We had been looking for something tasty, and healthy. And in a sea of just.. uggg.. expensive crap... we came across they Lyfe site and got excited.\n\nWe contacted them, and they were very attentive, responsive, and friendly. They were just starting their catering arm, but told us they would be on top of it.\n\nThe day of they delivered it to us.. we took it up... and  we were shocked by how good the food was! All of the guests were raving about it. The Grain bowl, the steak, and the chicken with Brussel sprouts were the stand out hits.  ALL the food was great!\n\n(also, their Pom-ginger lemondae makes a great mixer, just add whiskey or vodka.\n\nThis place is great... We fed 60 people for only 900 dollars, (with 4 pans still full left over.) The food is healthy, tasty, and inexpensive. So if you need catering for a wedding / event that is GOOD.. try them out!
253	1	a	I have been here 5 times. Not sure why people rate it less than 4 stars. Either way they have vegan, vegetarian, and normal menus. Very flavorful. The quinoa pancakes are a great healthy choice to breakfast.  Corn chowder is very good. My wife gets the vegan burger and says it's the best tasting vegan burger she has had. I love fresh healthy ingredients and this place has exactly that.
254	0	a	Tighten up, Management. Nothing worse than a great idea, a clean facility, and decent to good food ruined by very poor and disappointing service...\n\nBreakfast this morning with a large party. Around 20 minutes after ordering, my simple oatmeal had still not arrived, while others who had ordered egg dishes etc were already eating. This was because they had run out of oatmeal. How can you wait twenty minutes after running out to come tell us it will be another ten minutes before more is ready? That is not how a dialed breakfast spot runs. They should have told us in a reasonable time so we could switch our order if we didn't feel like waiting a half hour for a bowl of oatmeal.\n\nGetting our drinks was a major challenge, too. Clueless wait staff totally unaware what we had ordered.\n\nPlease cut this nonsense out already and learn how to execute proper service people.
255	0	a	A well engineered 'slight-of-hand'... breakfast is pretty decent.. all the rest of the menu is 'filler.' Like a chicken-wrap where maybe there was a sliver of the bird, but your taste buds are sayin 'all-salad.' And a glass of 'Simi cabernet' that ain't nothin like any Simi-cab you've had before (color more like a light pinot). Add it all up 2 wines, 2 entrees and the tab comes to $42... ain't no-way worth it.
256	0	a	Great concept ,great location but sadly poor food quality and options.3types of meats.Small portions.Poor Stuff.High prices for what you get.Vegas is the spot for healthy kitchens and unfortunately LYFE can't compete with any of the Protein places in town.No return for me
257	1	a	"I call this type of food \""LA food\"" - healthyish, with gluten-free / vegan / organic / whatever items available on the menu. I might still end up ordering something fried in trans fats, but I love the idea of having the option of something allegedly healthy. Nothing is healthier than making a dressing-free salad at home, but sometimes life gets crazy. \n\nIn any case, I came here around 10.30 after having some maintenance done over at Sola Salons. I ordered the fish tacos for takeaway to have as lunch later. After I waited for a few minutes, the cashier / hostess told me she had totally spaced and that they weren't serving lunch yet. They were making my tacos, but it would just be a few extra minutes. I appreciate that they made them anyway, instead of asking me to order something else.\n\nTBH, I ate the tacos right before an exam and I stress blackout, so I can't really remember much about them, but I'm sure they were good. Service was fast and friendly, the place was clean and bright, and I'm assuming for now the food was good. \n\nMy guy friends tend to have a \""where's the beef?\"" and \""what? it's so small\"" experience  when they come here, but for a small eater like me, portions are perfectly .. proportioned."
258	1	a	Ate lunch here today with a friend and both of our selections were delicious! I ordered the Quinoa Crunch Wrap & my friend ordered the Barramundi Noodle Bowl.  I cannot recall the name of the LYFE water I chose, but it had a spiced apple flavor and was delicious! The staff was attentive, friendly and professional. \nI am excited to go back and try another menu item. \nOnly concern I have is the restaurant space is very large and it wasn't busy enough at prime lunch time to fill it.  Hope they are profitable enough to keep such a large space open.
259	0	a	Entering life kitchen feel great. And honestly a bit on the sterile. Kinda like a hospital. Not very cozy. Unless you bring a companion I got here at 5 o'clock and they lacked the accoutrements for four things that my party ordered. Which wasn't a big problem however they weren't able to offer me a solution or accommodate me otherwise. We were forced to order other things off the menu and since this was my first time was a little disconcerting.  I ordered the grass fed burger and fish tacos. It is quite tasty however a party 3 cost me 85 dollars. Probably won't be coming back here due to cost effectiveness
260	1	a	Having food allergies is no fun!  When I find a spot the truly caters to my needs it gives me a sense of peace knowing I can eat without being ill for 3 days following the meal.  This spot has a lot of options and caters to many dietary needs.  The food is fresh and the employees were really friendly and helpful.  The food was a little pricey but that's what you pay for when you have organic choices.  The food didn't blow my mind, it wasn't the best food I've ever had but it was good and appetizing.  I really enjoyed the flavor infused waters.  The place has a neat design element as well.  I had the tacos and the were delicious.  I would return and suggest others give it a try as well.
261	1	a	The place itself is beautiful.  Nice modern decor with a feel of natural! They even have their own indoor garden! - then the menu is awesome.....they have all kinds of options for vegans, and people with allergies like myself.........huge GF menu!.\nI ordered a GF grass fed burger with baked garlic parmesan sweet potato fries and a ginger mint chia water that was mmmm AMAZING! - I REALLY enjoyed my meal, it was tasty and healthy and very reasonably priced.  It will definitely be one of my favorite places in town from now on! Loved it!
262	1	a	There is LYFE in the District! I stopped in for a girls lunch at LYFE.  I had heard many things about it and was excited to give them a try.  \n\nYou walk into a bright and open dining area.  Everything was so clean and airy.  They even have their fresh herbs growing near the registers. There are several menus by the front.  I like how they split up menus for those who want gluten free or vegan.  Otherwise there is an 'Everything' menu which is great for me.  Service was very professional, polite and friendly.  I appreciated the fact of employees coming by during our meal to check on how things were.  :-)\n\nI chose the fish tacos and sweet corn chowder.  The tacos were filled with grilled mani, chayote slaw, avocado, cilantro, chipotle aioli surrounded by corn tortillas.  The fresh salsa on the side had a wonderful flavor that really complimented the tacos.  The corn chowder was so delicious!  I loved every bite and it came in a big bowl. I would definitely get that again.\n\nOverall this is a great place for healthy eating in the District area.  Give them a try!
263	1	a	I was at this location during a visit with family, and my comment is based on the service. The staff were very accommodating for the finicky preschooler in our party - and I appreciate that. The menu is the same as the one in my city, so I ordered my favorite - the gluten free burger.
264	1	a	Clean interior.  Healthy menu.  Menu items are rather pricey.  I like the play on words.  LYFE stands for Love Your Food Everyday.  Sweet Corn Chowder and Chicken, Mushroom, & Spinach Penne, with a glass of Cucumber Mint water was what I ordered.  The Cucumber Mint water was very refreshing.  Food was a little slow coming out, but once it did, my unhappiness with the speed of service disappeared.  The chowder was absolutely delicious and my pasta dish was on point!  I will definitely be returning to this establishment.
265	1	a	Great show with good production values. The lead singer is sensational and can really belt out her songs. Production values are good. The dancers are very good and natural beauties, for those who care.\n \nI agree with the other reviewer that the transitions between songs were, at times, a bit difficult to discern. I am sure they quickly go from one number to the next to keep the pacing of the show moving along. Music choices were great, mostly modern pop and rock with a hint of EDM. Very cool and kept the girls moving.
266	0	a	"This \""topless\"" show was definitely more comedy than it was sexy..... and they didn't even have a comedian. It was comedy watching the people in the front center tables trying not to choke to death on the endless barrage of smoke. The poor guy in front probably missed half the show as he was covered in smoke. It was also comedy watching this show as the awkward transitions between songs never stopped and the song selection at times was so ridiculous that it was hard not to laugh. Oh and about those \""topless\"" performers. You have a better chance of seeing topless girls walking the strip. This nearly hour and a half show has about 3 minutes of total topless time. Yes... topless time. I understand trying to cater to women but there are plenty of other shows on the strip that do that too and manage to actually be way more provocative. By the time the girls were removing tops the scene was ending. Look... I get this isn't a strip club but why do you think guys come to the show? It's certainly not just for production value and dancing. \n\nPlanet Hollywood needs to move this show to a smaller theater if they plan to keep it... the theater was 90% empty and it was ridiculously quiet.\n\nThe show gets two stars because Yelp makes me give them 1 and the girls from the show deserve the other. The girls are beautiful, the choreography was decent and the singer actually has a pretty solid voice. If Planet Hollywood and the production team got their acts together this show could actually have a chance. But PH has become the kings of tossing out any show possible to see if it sticks so this is probably just the next in line."
267	0	a	"You would have no idea which show I was referring to if I said I saw it in Las Vegas and it starred a group of fairly attractive women doing dance routines to prerecorded music while topless.  That not only describes \""Sydney After Dark\"", but also current strip shows like \""Fantasy\"", \""X Burlesque\"" and \""Crazy Girls\"".  \n\nAustralian accents aside, there is nothing new being offered here.  As I watched the prerequisite cowgirl scene, I wondered how/why THIS had become the formula for Vegas topless shows?  Maybe having a girl that sings makes it classier than a strip club?  There has to be a more creative way to present half naked girls!  Oh!  They have a girl in a leotard doing an aerial scarves act!  That was so cool and original like 10 years ago but a snoozefest today.  A topless comedian would have been much better.    \n\nKeeping with the Aussie theme, they dance to mostly native artists from the \""lahnn daahn undah\"" like AC/DC, Tina Arena, Sia and INXS.  I can only guess their sultry version of \""Locomotion\"" was inspired by Kylie Minogue.  They even did an aboriginal routine which left me feeling cultured and educated.  That's a lie. \n\nThe few people in attendance (15% capacity at best) were all moved up to the best seats so buy the cheapest ones if you're going to pay.  I would recommend \""Fantasy\"" at Luxor over this.  The girls are hotter!"
268	1	a	"I should preface that I got comped tickets to the show.\n\nSydney After Dark is in former Peep Show theater inside Planet Hollywood. Peep Show was amazing and it shows that this theater has the potential for an awesome show. That said, Sydney After Dark was decent at best. \n\nFirst (producers if you are reading this- pay attention), they are absolutely strict about cell phones/cameras BEFORE and during the show. Everyone is warned as they're escorted to the seats. The couple next to me was trying to take a picture before the show began and was warned that they could get ejected. I completely understanding hurting the \""atmosphere\"" during the show, but this basically kills any free PR/word of mouth/social media exposure! And hence, the theater was only about 25% full.\n\nThere are 10 gorgeous Australian barbie-like girls that goes through a variety of numbers. I felt that most of the numbers are too short and they really lacked any \""wow\"" factor. Yes, they hit the basic of song and dance, but there really isn't anything memorable. \n\nIt would have been nice if there were some sort of ticket signing/photo session at the end of the show (again free PR!).\n\nAt a basic ticket price of $60, I don't feel that it's worth the money. Either up the performance or lower the price."
269	1	a	"Sydney After Dark seems to be a cross between a mega showgirl show like Jubilee and a low rent topless show like Crazy Girls.  What it does well it does very well, but because it's doesn't seem to know exactly what it wants to be, it doesn't completely succeed.\n\nFirst, the positives..the set, sound, lighting, costumes are first class and beautiful.  The dancers are lovely and the singer is great...it is a beautiful show to look at.\n\nOn the other hand...the size of the theatre, including both the stage and the seating, overwhelm the show.  It needs to be in a smaller theatre such as the Saxe to give more intimacy with the audience and because it seems unlikely it will sell out a theatre the size of what the Blue Man group commands.  \""Jubillee\"" can manage it but it has 30+ cast members and lots of novelty acts. \"" Crazy Girls\"" and \""X-rocks\"" is on a tiny stage with only 5 dancers and one comedian. \""Sydney\"" has 10 in the cast and 2 novelty acts and would be best suited to something in between those other two...unless it wants to go full Jubilee and expand the show to match its setting.\n\nThe numbers are well done but the show doesn't really build to anything and doesn't really have a coherent theme.  At first it seemed this was something I would expect to see if I were in a showroom in Sydney...but then they stopped the show in the middle to make an audience member an honorary Aussie.  I think it wouldn't be a bad idea to go further in this area, but then the motif of the show should change to make more of the individual acts Aussie themed...get rid of Madonna and Lady Gaga and use more Austrailian music and settings and explain them and they can more completely separate themselves from the other topless shows out there.\n\nStill a fun night but could be better."
270	0	a	Oh man. This show was beyond corny and the husband and I finally gave up and left early. I hate to be so negative, as all of the ladies were lovely, but they clearly didn't have much to work with. I'm pretty sure my old high school drill team could have equaled this performance. \n\nThis is Vegas, I feel like there is a standard that this show doesn't live up to. If I could have gotten my money back and made it to another show I would have been happy. This show was neither hot nor worth the price of the ticket.
271	1	a	Barely open less than a week and I've been here three times already! There's no doubt Im really diggin' this new cafe.  If you worked up an appetite at the gym nearby, they have great healthy options for you here! When I feel like a carnivore or not , they've got it covered too. What appealed to me was the superfoods like Kale, Beets, and Quinoa in the salads and the artisinal breads and cheeses used for the sandwiches.  All healthy, fresh ingredients, and mega delish!\n \nMy orders so far have been salads, their vegetarian sandwich and custom made juice. The prices are inexpensive, my meals so far have averaged $11. That's pretty good for a place that specializes in healthier choices. You know my gripe about healthy smoothies and juices that cost as much as my lunch. (ahem PH) Well here it's much more reasonable.  So you healthy smoothie fanatics might want to try it for sure.\n \nNice variety of salads in their cold case display that you can choose from. Sold by the scoop starting at $2.75 depending on which salad you get. You can add side of protien to it also.  Scoop equals about a small bowl portion and it didn't leave me starving. The first time I was there I got two different salads and couldn't finish it.  \n\n== Mint Vinaigrette== what a novel idea for the the Kale, Quinoa, Cranberries, Cashews, Feta salad! Dressing light and compliments with the Kale. \n\nAnd Beets, and I detect Oranges? Something citrusy. Ingredients are the perfect engery/refuel booster before or after your workout at the gym.\n\nThe Tandoori Chicken with mango and coconut and Cauliflower Kale with raisins are the more exotic creations spiced with curry...and you know I love yellow curry.\n\nMeatless Monday I got the Vegetarian Sandwich. So good even non vegetarians like me love it. This one was roasted eggplant, roasted red peppers, GOAT CHEESE, olive tapanade on a 9 grain bread. Just BRILLIANT!\n\nThe cafe is pretty chill. Dining area cafe style with just a few tables and high-tops and a picnic bench outdoors if you dare to eat out there in this heat.  \n\nService dining in has been cool so far. Order and pay first at counter. They'll bring food out to your table. Our orders came out in a timely manner. I didn't order anything that needed to be grilled or cooked though. The staff has been really nice and friendly. They already recognize their regular customers . \n\nThey need to hurry up and get that ice tea or brewed tea in. Im not a fan of carbonated sodas and a cheaper alternative to juices and smoothies would be nice. A paper take out menu would be handy too. I was told to look it up online but not everyone is capable of looking it up. Those are some small kinks they need to work on based on my visits. \n\nThey are just four days into their soft opening phase. Word of mouth spread thru the crew from Gimme Some Sugar next door is how I found out! Go figure! Looking forward to even more visits now that I can have healthy eats then sweet treats right after.
272	1	a	This is my second time here this week! Everyone is super nice and the good is delicious. I have had a meatball pide and the no pasta lasagna. Both excellent. The food is cooked to order and whe you receive it, it is nice and hot. The portion sizes are very generous and good for sharing multiple dishes.
273	0	a	Incredibly slow! Service sucks! People couldn't care about how slow! It's lunch time I don't want to wait 30 minuets after I paid $60 for my family to go to lunch! They need to get their stuff together! You can't be slow and expensive!!!!
274	0	a	This review does not reflect my fellow Yelpers recommendations as I do value their observations and insight.   \n\nBasically this restaurant will fail as the owners have no clue how to run a kitchen let alone a restaurant.   \nWhen I walked in for lunch there were only 8 customers.   However I had to wait 5 minutes to order because Matt (one of the owners) couldn't figure out how to ring a credit card transaction.   Then it was my turn and without saying a word he walked away into the kitchen.   The young lady also behind the counter saw this and ran over to help me.  Ok....the ordering was easy then it all blew up.\nWhile waiting for my food which never arrived BTW...about 20 customers came in and the kitchen was thrown into chaos.\nA 2nd owner showed up and was trying to help but as they were finally getting food out all the orders were wrong.   Did either of the two guys say anything or even look at their customers?  NO.  It was left to the young lady to handle the grumbling which was growing in frequency.   \nSince it is an open Kitchen I could see that they didn't even have a system to prioritize the orders.   The young lady simply slapped them onto the vent hood on top of each other so you couldn't tell what to prepare first.  Having worked my way through graduate school in a few restaurants, prioritizing your orders is basic 101 stuff.\nSo my check was rung in at 12:59:50....and at 1:40p I still had no food like a lot of other folks.  I got up and left.   I felt that since they were so disorganized and obviously oblivious to basic customer service that it would be a hassle to get my $13.39 back.  So they have my $ and I had a Nature Valley bar back at my office.   Never had a chance to taste their food and never will.  I will not go back.   Waiting 40 minutes for food is unacceptable at a lunch counter.
275	1	a	Presto Cafe offers a unique variety of sandwiches, salads, pides, and smoothies that will make you excited for lunchtime again!  They use fresh and flavorful ingredients that satisfy your pallete and wont let you crash later.  My favorite item on the menu is the Turkey Sandwich, it is totally awesome and something I could eat over and over again. Great service and a great atmosphere too... Check this place out!
276	1	a	I have been a long time Presto fan and with most places its hard to transfer the same quality that you fall in love with from 1 store to another. Well they did it. I love the meatball sliders and recently became a huge fan of the breakfast burrito. Little known secret your allowed to add the steak which takes it to another level. Reza the owner really knows how to make you feel good when you come in and i cant be happier for the new location. Best Of luck.
277	1	a	My new favorite spot and so close to my house!!! Everything is so great!!! I think I've had pretty much everything on the menu too!!! The avocado ad pea salad is my favorite. Great selection for any kind of eater with any kind of diet limitations.
278	1	a	I tried the Greek Pide and Steak & Eggs \n\nBoth dishes were fresh made and delicious!! The staff was super friendly I will be a regular here
279	1	a	For my 100th review I wanted it to be some place awesome! Presto Cafe sure fit the bill. I got the chance to finally check out their new Henderson location this afternoon with my husband Joel. \n\nWhen we walked in we were immediately greeted and asked if this was our first time in. He gave us an overview of the menu and told us some popular dishes. Everything sounded amazing. I love that they serve breakfast all day. They also have some tasty sounding smoothies. In the end Joel ordered their Meatballs and I ordered the Ham & Cheese Please. We decided to share them. Joel's meatballs were so moist and tasty. He got three meatball sliders. The pesto mixed well with the homemade meatball and sauce. The buns were soft and melded perfectly with the meatball. My Ham & Cheese Please was out of this world delicious! It was piled high with Black Forest Ham, gruyere cheese, the most amazing pickled cranberry and blueberry compote, Funyuns, field greens, and chili mayo all this greatness on a bacon and cheese bread. Omg this was like the best sandwich ever!! They should totally bottle the pickled cranberry and blueberry compote. All the items in the sandwich really complement each other. This is truly an epic sandwich. \n\nSide note totally unrelated to the food or the chef.... While enjoying our meal I couldn't help but over hear, who I thought was the owner,  loudly making negative remarks to his friends about a similar competing business in the area (I'm not going to say which). Just a reminder to keep it classy. :) \n\nWith all that said I'll totally be back in to try all the other wonderful things on the menu.
280	1	a	Great healthy fresh food. Made to order but the downside is the wait. I've tried the ahi tuna seasonal salad and it's amazing! The smoothies are fresh and aren't overly sweet. Decent portions considering the quality of the dishes. The meatball sandwich is really good and is great for comfort food:) \nPerfect place for a post gym workout meal.
281	0	a	"Having read reviews on Yelp on Presto over the weekend I had made a mental note to give it a try.  As it turned out finding myself hungry I was about to pull into Highroller for a Fig it Out Burger but remembered I was also in the vicinity of Presto as well.  A quick U turn I couldn't be more delighted to find an actual full shady spot at 4 pm.  I'm a big fan of being greeted upon entering with a hello  at least in smaller establishments such as this so I was smiling from the git go!  There were fewer than ten customers and no line when we arrived.  Had I not read the reviews on Yelp I wouldn't have known about the salad by the scoop, or what a Pide was or how it was pronounced.  This place really has a WONDERFUL business concept.  The niche it fills has a tremendous potential for SUCCESS especially with its location.  I doubt that they could have found a more ideal location UNLESS...it had a drive through window for quick juice, or Smoothie Pick ups or such.  Comfortable seating was comfortable.  My daughter chose a smoothie and was very pleased with it.  Giving me a taste I found the flavor balance of ingredients to be very well thought out.  Ginger can easily be over done....but this was very well done!  \nMy order of Greek Pide arrived and looked yummy and the ingredients Grape Tomatoes Basil Pesto and red peppers  were bright and made my mouth water.  \nThe crust looked golden for the most part on top... although there was one end with a burnt area but with a fresh baked item I expect a certain amount of variety and as in the case of many pieces of art... there is room for such flaws...and if it had ended there... I wouldn't have considered there to be any flaw in this Pide. It wasn't until flavor profiles seemed off that I turned the piece I was eating over to discover it was burnt. As it was directly beneath the area that appeared the most burnt I didn't think much of it and as the rest didn't look too over cooked from the top I didn't expect for a moment that the rest would be inedible as well.  I scraped the ingredients off eating them and enjoying them... I nibbled on the surface crust that was fine.   I enjoyed my meal.  I made it work. Why?  Well Having more errands to run in what is turning out to be a very busy week I didn't have the time to wait for another to be prepared.  And they are prepared to order which is one of the delights of Presto.  My daughter asked if I was going to let the managment know and I assured her that I would.   As I bussed our table I took the 'plate' to the counter and was asked by a tall smiling gentleman how it was.   I replied \""Burnt\"".  He looked me in the eye and said \""awesome'.   I was a bit taken aback.   I asked him why burnt was Awesome and I realized he must have not heard me correctly.  The plate was shown to others in the kitchen and I was offered a refund.  There was no need for a refund.  I simply wanted them to be aware of the potential of having to make an adjustment to cook times or oven temps.  As I was exiting another customer asked about my meal.  I stopped and spoke with her and was interrupted by the tall man behind the counter and told not to bother other guests.  The guest and I both informed him that she had inquired and so I was simply responding.  THIS interaction left more of a sour taste in my mouth than the discovery that the entire bottom crust of my meal was burnt.  Somethings in this establishment need to improve.  Some are easy fixes like adjusting oven temps.  If one views photos posted by others there is also a Blanco Pide shown which is burnt enough on top to make me wonder if it was perhaps blacker than mine now in retrospect. Some things are not as easy to fix in a business."
282	1	a	"Really like this place. I go at least once a week. Salmon is delicious. Friendly staff. The smoothies are excellent, so much better than chain \""juice bars\""."
283	1	a	Fresh made salad is amazing.  Very friendly service.  2 scoops of salad with a free range chx breast for 11 bucks.  The salad scoop choices are very extensive.  I had the kale quinoa feta tomato and the black bean corn avacado for the other scoop.  Enjoy a lunch that will energize your afternoon.
284	1	a	This place has the feel of a great coffee shop,  with leather padded seatting (Even the high tops) but worth healthy foods & a juice bar instead of coffee.  Just finished a wonderful meal with my boyfriend.  I started with the kale, cashew & cranberry salad that was full of flavor.  Then I had the protein burrito filled with steak, quinoa, avocado & arugala. My boyfriend had the Ruben on a raisin walnut bread. Everything is made fresh daily & it shows. The staff is very friendly & helpful.  We will be back.
285	0	a	My review is based upon three different experiences at this location. \n\nAll of the items I tried fell short which saddened me since the location is convenient to both my home and office. Paired with the extra long wait time (average 45 minutes) it's just not worth it. \n\nThe Greek Salad was ok but the dressing wasn't that great and the olive tapenade was overly salty. The Israeli cous cous with steak and chimichurri sauce was lacking, the steak was well cooked. Chimichurri sauce it was not, more like a pesto which was too heavy when paired with other items in the dish. There are many healthy locations with a much larger selection and tastier food within a 5 minute drive. Trust me and pass on this one. \nIn addition they have no nutritional info posted which the other healthy locations nearby do. This is very important to me when stating your food is healthy.
286	1	a	Such a great place, food is amazing and service is equally as great. Staff is extremely knowledgeable of dietary needs and taste recos. Must haves; Israeli couscous is amazing (my 12 year old picky niece LOVED it, it has a great flair of truffle and Parmesan. Pide (pee-day) is a great option, the crust is light and the flavors bold. This is our new go to spot.
287	1	a	I went here for lunch to try something new since I saw there business on one of the yelp highlights and ordered something different, even though I should have read a little better, a veg sandwich and once I took the olives off I liked it. I did help my significant other eat his pizza thing and that was pretty different and good too! Thanks.
288	1	a	"Casual environment,  delicious food.  My husband and I shared a Greek salad and a Greek style \""pide\"" (think pizza ... but healthy).  All the ingredients were fresh and the portions were generous enough to share.   We will definately come back on our next visit."
289	0	a	"After doing an awesome YOUTUBE chest & tri workout by MIKE CHANG (HEY MIKE!), I didn't want a girly salad or grilled chicken and brown rice DAMNIT! I wanted some red meat! I stopped by Presto Cafe and when I looked at the menu my intuition told me--DONT DO IT. But--of course I didn't listen and I ordered the Hanger steak. At first I was excited because they told me they cook it to medium rare and I was drooling over having risotto. When I arrived at home, my steak was NOW well done due to \""carry-over\"", and something about it didn't seem healthy. I need to double check the calorie count if its on the menu, but that green Pesto was VERY oily. The risotto was flavorless, but ok--S&P can fix that--but how much cheese was added to it???\nBelieve me--I'm not an excessive calorie counter, but I don't like excess oil, butter, etc.\nI don't know. I was just getting major bad vibes. \n\nSo, I mixed the pesto and OH LORD WHAT DID I DO THAT FOR? Whatever they put in the pesto--it was soooooooo sour! It was like there was a vinegar added. I've never had pesto taste like that, nor have the ones i've made tasted anything like that. I picked at it and beat myself up for not listening to my \""first mind\"". Ughhhhh....$14.00 down the drain. I kept it the next day hoping the flavors would marinate and taste better--um NO. Maybe this is one of those spots where you have to give it another chance--but I honestly can't see myself going back."
290	1	a	This place is so good. I've had the porchetta and turkey sandwiches, each absolutely wonderful. The bread is so tasty and really makes the sandwich gone together. I've also had a couple of the juices - my own blend, each unique and yummy. I can't wait to try more things.
291	0	a	Expensive, not that great tasting, and took them 35 minutes to make two sandwiches. Definitely seemed understaffed since they were getting to-go orders out before ours. Not the best customer service or atmosphere either, just seemed really bland and boring in there.\n\nAlso, the guy behind us was waiting for his food just as long as us and they forgot his soup, it took them about 15 more minutes to get him his soup. I could tell he was livid.\n\nHopefully they improve but sorry to say we will not be coming back anytime soon.
292	0	a	First off, I can say that the food was not bad at all. We ordered Green Eggs and Ham flat bread and the BBQ Chicken pizza. Both were super good. The bad things were:\n\n-Cooks did not seem aware of what they were supposed to be making considering the fact that they had to ask each other multiple times whether the pizza was BBQ or Greek and every time, I answered instead of their manager or front counter person whom sat in the back on his laptop the entire time we were there. \n\n-IF YOU HAVE A NUT ALLERGY, MAKE SURE YOU ASK WHAT IS IN THE SAUCES!!!! I have a severe allergy to only cashews and pistachios. I do know from eating somewhat healthy that some vegan cheeses are made/ based from cashews. Never in my right mind though did i think to ask that the pesto was made from cashews (as it is normally made with pine nuts) and they do not disclose any of this on the menu or the to-go menu. Needless to say after a phone call to the restaurant and a hospital visit there were cashews in the pizza. I did not even get to enjoy the meal.
293	1	a	I was looking for new and healthy restaurant around the area and yelp led me to this place. When walking in we were immediately greeted by the two gentlemen working. They were kind of hilarious and good company while they were preparing my food. I ordered the ahi sliders and vegetarian lasagna! Oh man they were delicious! The only reason I give 4 stars is because the ambience was just mediocre, but I got take out anyways...Will definitely be going back when I'm in town and glad to see they are serving juice! NOM!
294	1	a	And Presto! Healthy and delicious food!\n\nI am trying to start the new year off right by changing my diet.  I think I've had my share of 'unhealthy' food for the past few years.  Presto offers healthy comfort food that I won't feel guilty about eating.  Located on the corner of Stephanie and Paseo Verde, it's very easy to find.  I was tempted to walk next door to Gimme Some Sugar (one of my favs) but I resisted.\n\nI met a friend here for lunch.  She is the epitome of healthy! So what do I order? The Vegetarian Lasagna and a scoop of Israeli couscous.  The verdict? Absolutely delicious! The lasagna is pasta free with sweet potato, kale and eggplant.  I wasn't sure if I'd like it. I loved it!   Filling and delicious without the guilt. The garlic sauce was a great compliment.\n\nPresto also offers a variety of side salad scoops.  Trust me when I say 1 scoop is more than enough.  The couscous consisted of mushrooms, parmesan and lemon truffle.  So flavorful and would definitely order this again.\n\nThe dining area was kept very clean with pretty comfy chairs as well! Service was great.  Very friendly staff all around!  They are open for breakfast, lunch and dinner for your enjoyment!
295	1	a	Wonderful service very delicious and healthy. . Very much recommend. . Food is amazin. Can't wait for the entertainment bon Saturday
296	1	a	I had the seafood kabob. It was very tasty salmon and shrimp. I also particularly liked the rice which had some little pasta throughout it. Good quality food - I recommend it.
297	1	a	Great food. Good atmosphere. good prices. Highly recommend this place!!!
298	0	a	"Lots of Mediterranean places have popped up in this space: Opa, Plaka, and now Maza. New ownership, interior has had a face lift, cool bar area but no alcohol available yet. Menu mentions $7 lunch specials but I did not see any advertised. \n\nOrdered the chicken shwarma sandwich with rice, $10- hostess/server gave me a heads up that the dish \""isn't really a shwarma, it's made in a pan\"". Decided to give it a try anyway, and the meat and seasonings are okay but it was served, inexplicably, in a giant hoagie bun. When I am at a Mediterranean restaurant, I expect a sandwich to come on pita or lavash, this bun was way too much bread! \nThe meat was of okay quality but sandwich was not served with any sort of sauce, just peppers, onions, and tomato, which gave the dish almost a fajita feel.\nOption of rice or fries for my side, picked the rice, which was warm and soft, but after eating the sandwich breading, I couldn't take any more carbs.\n\nNote that they have discount deals up on Yelp and Groupon, and a Yelp check in offer for a free piece of baklava, which was honored even for my take-out order."
299	1	a	"\"" You know when you go to a restaurant and the service is good, but the food is not quite good? There comes a point when the manager comes to you and asks you about the service and the food and their just so nice that you have to lie about the food being good. But service is great. Well ladies and gentlemen you don't have to worry about that here at Maza Grill the food is fantastic!! Hands down, hummus here phenomenal!\"""
300	1	a	Very nice and clean place and the food is authentic turkish.
301	1	a	Wow. .. chicken can't be more moist. Lamb and rice is soooo good . Great staff and very fresh meats.
302	1	a	Food and service was excellent a large menus leyla are Waitress was great the 5 of us had a great time there was a singer and music ..we had the dinner family style the  kabobs was super as was the salads and appetizers
303	0	a	Meh service and meh food. I got the hummus for an appetizer, the Mediterranean salad with salmon for an entree while my brother got the chicken and mushroom Alfredo for his entree. The hummus was nothing special and the Mediterranean salad was alright. The salmon was fantastic though. Blackened the way I like it. My brother was upset with his pasta because it had red pepper flakes which was not stated on the menu (maybe it was and we don't remember though) it also had literally two slices of mushroom. It shouldn't be called the chicken and mushroom pasta if there are barely going to be any mushrooms in it. My salad also was missing the kalamata olives it was stated to have come with. The service was really just blah. The waitress was nice enough but she brought me the wrong iced tea (raspberry) at first and also my salad came out about 5 minutes after my brother's food. Which doesn't sound like a long time but it is when the person is waiting for you to get your food and there's is getting cold. The last thing was there was no one on the floor for periods of time. There should always be someone watching the dining room. Definitely never coming back here.
304	0	a	"this restaurant failed to update their menu on a delivery app... after receiving only a fraction of my food, they still insisted on charging me 10.00 an item for food I didn't get, because they \""haven't gotten around to updating their menu on that app.\"" How can you charge someone for food they don't get, and refuse to fix it?! \nworst customer service I have ever experienced. they were rude over the phone, offered no help, and refused to refund my money or call me back. \nI will never order from this pathetic excuse of a business ever again. \ndisgraceful."
305	1	a	Very Authentic Turkish style food. Leyla our server was very nice. It was our first time eating in their dining room though we have ordered takeout from here several times.  I ordered the Beef Kabob and my spouse ordered the beef Adana Kabob. The Beef Adana was fantastic and very flavorful.  When we come back and we will soon we want to try the Kuru Fasulye which are White Beans cooked with chopped lamb meat in tomatoe sauce.  Service was fast food is great. I have no problem suggesting this place to even my most picky friends. You must try the baklava for dessert.
306	1	a	Loved this Mediterranean food.!\nDished were beautiful and delicious.\nThe new owner came out too greet us and brought tea and rice for us to sample. Very friendly and youthful.\nWe came in the middle of the afternoon so it was a little quiet but filled up before we left.\nLooks like they have luff music in the evenings.\nWe will definitely be back.
307	1	a	I super like this place. I bought a deal on groupon. It was so worth it with the amount of food plus free baklava that we got, also the Turkish coffee was awesome. And the girl that helped us was not only strikingly beautiful but very very nice, helpful and informative.
308	0	a	We ordered from grub hub from Maza.  The delivery was very fast, but the food was awful.  We ordered the fish plate, and it consisted of tuna from a can, imitation crab salad, and lox.  I also ordered a pasta that came with some kind of oil that was inedible.  I have not dined at their restaurant, but do not order their takeout from grub hub.  At this point I am sure that I will not try dining in, as the food was disgusting.
309	1	a	Wow. Probably the tastiest kebab I've ever eaten.\n\nThe seafood kebab comes with juicy lump of salmon and flavorful grilled shrimp, as well as the shiny grains of rice and grilled tomato and chili. The tomato-based dipping sauce has intricate but not overpowering flavor that complements the simplicity of grilled stuff.\n\nTried both lamb and beef, and while both were really good, lamb will remain as our fix. Hummus was great, too.\n\nBut I cannot end this review without mentioning the most surprising find: Baklava.\n\nWhenever we tried baklava in the past, it was always too sweet to the point that caused a headache. We never liked it. But as this place offered baklava as a check-in bonus, we decided to try on a whim - and glad we did! The baklava had a delicate sweetness and texture, and the flavor of ground pistachio completed the traditional Turkish pastry. Also, we ordered a couple of chai - comes in the traditional cute little cup - at no charge!\n\nOne major letdown was that the both times we visited, the table cloth was not clean, and the paper table cover didn't fit with the shape of the table in a booth, and kept making friction noise all the time. Interior design could use some sprucing up.\n\nWhen those issues are solved, I can give them five stars!
310	0	a	I ordered chicken shawarma and was cold, and without seasoning.  I told the server that the Shawarma was so could and she microwaved it!!!!  The place was noisy. The owner was singing!!
311	1	a	the food was Delicious.\nthe staff was amazing friendly and lovely.\nthe atmosphere in the restaurant was nice.\nwe just love to be there and eat there.\nwe will come back!
312	1	a	Best hookah lounge to be at. \nBeautiful service\nVery clean\nAmazing deals\nIt's a great place to come and hang out with friends. Listen to music and play some pool
313	0	a	Looked great online and decided to go in!! My friends and I were looking for somewhere fun and relaxing to go... Got to say I was pretty disappointed! Coals took forever and the sheesha was low quality! Went from fresh thick smoke to burnt in less then 5 minutes! Won't be coming here again!
314	1	a	Brush Party: Sunday 08/24/2014 BYOB\nToday's Tom Sawyer\n\nThree hours of fun, I didn't know what to expect, I thought it would be fun and it was!  I was a little nervous thanking that maybe someone just wanted his or her fence panted and was trying to make it fun like Tom Sawyer. The instructor led the class with little entertaining lectures and demonstrations of what we should be doing to our canvas next. I had never painted before, except maybe a fence, and I did not like my creation at first. It has grown on me, just as our wonderful instructor informed the class it would. My friend whom attended with me had a great time as well. The wine I had brought only helped to make the experience more fun. I would recommend this adventure to everyone. Parties of one to six can be booked. I am going to be going back and hope to see you there!
315	1	a	My husband and another couple attended a class on 9/26/14 and we had a great time! Anthony was our instructor and he was great! We painted the bridge scene and although the it looked difficult, he made the class fun, the painting doable for all of us and all four of us really enjoyed him. We look forward to going again! We can't wait to go back for the Pop Art Your Pet class :)
316	0	a	"I wanted to like this place. Shoot, I even gave it a second Groupon try, but unfortunately, I can't mesh with the female teacher here. \n\nI have had her for both of my experiences, and both times have had the same results. I know it isn't just me, both times I brought at least five people in my party.\n\nIs she nice? Yes. Very. She teaches school and seems really cool.\n\nBut for some reason, I feel like she hasn't really clicked with the whole concept. Every time I have gone, she rushes ahead, messes up, doesn't paint the picture that we sign up for, and leaves us with incomplete paintings because we run out of time. The last one I did, she simply kind of just announced we had ten minutes to just \""do whatever we wanted to finish our painting.\"" It was quite disappointing as we aren't artists and wanted her to instruct us how to do the painting all the way to the finish. \n\nAlso, as mentioned, she went way off from what we signed up for. The first time she didn't hang a picture of the original. So, the second time we asked several times if she would (knowing she strays from it) but she wouldn't.  \n\nIt sounds trivial almost, but when you pay that much and want to paint a specific painting to hang up in your home, its insanely disappointing. The second picture we did was a poppy field. We never even got to the poppies. So, I came home with a picture of some mountains."
317	1	a	"I went for a girls night out with a coworker and I had a blast! It's great because you can bring your own bottle of wine. I think that helped the creativity flow and add \""personality\"" to my painting. I highly recommend Brush Party to anyone who wants to unwind and get creative. No prior painting experience necessary, just a good attitude. The location is good too, right off central, you could drink and take the light rail home. I must say Anthony (our instructor) was awesome and he had lots of funny jokes to keep us engaged. He is following his passion and you can tell by his enthusiasm for the business. Keep up the good work, would definitely come back!"
318	1	a	Anthony was funny, friendly and made me feel like I can paint! My best friend and I went to Brush Party to celebrate all the past birthdays that we were unable to spend together and we had a blast! Despite the creepy dude that was sitting in front of us. We painted sunset and it was a real pleasure to learn something new. I might have found a new hobby! Thanks Anthony!  Girl from South Lake Tahoe and Polish San Diegan.
319	0	a	I was really excited to go here after buying a groupon. I received a voicemail reminder about sending an email with pictures of the dogs we wanted to paint as they were hosting pop art your pet. I attempted to call back the next day and was unsuccessful in reaching the owners. They did not respond to my voicemail or emails and I wasted 50 dollars with still no communication. Very disappointed as I had a friend go and had race reviews.
320	0	a	Not sure if it's because it's a brand new staff or what. But it took far too long to get the food. Tried wings and they are ok but not great. Nachos we're soggy and not thrilling. Beer was good but honestly not cold enough. Back to the staff issue. The waitress brought togo boxes and just took off. Kind of like all the other times she brought something.  After the togo boxes we waited 14 minutes for the check.  I was told the Val Vista location is awesome so I tried this one. Not impressed at all. I doubt I'll come back.
321	0	a	Absolutely the worst service i have seen.  I would rate a 0 if possible. Walked in and a girl was writing on the sign up front she was the only one that said hello.  My wife and daughter proceeded in and no one greeted us asked us if we needed a child seat or even a menu for that matter. I went and got the child seat myself as i passed the 4 girls up front collecting it no one said a word. We then proceeded to sit there for over 5 minutes while at least 6 different employees passed our table none of which offered to help us.  I wish i could rate the food but if the service is that poor im sure the food is equally bad. I am happy that this will definitely help out the sushi place next door as thats where my family and i elected to go due to the horrendous lack of service we recieved, as im sure many others will do as well. Another note upon leaving the same girl was outside and said for us to have a good evening to which i responded your service is horrendous and she said nothing. Epic fail on customer service.
322	0	a	"Holy horrible. Just keep on walking past and eat at the dry cleaners. It'll be more appetizing. It all started when we sat down and the soda was lacking carbonation. We were going to order pizza and wings but were told the oven doesn't work and that pizza wasn't an option. So we figured we would just order their specialty, chicken wings!  Ummmm that's your specialty?? They weren't very good at all.  It even says on the menu that they're pro steroids in the chicken. That's how they're \""big\"". I didn't think they were any bigger than anywhere else and it was a little unappetizing bragging that they buy steroid injected chicken. The service was definitely rough around the edges. The waitress slammed the refill drink down with a thud as she ran past. I guess I did get a refill. That must count for something.  Definitely won't see the inside of this place again."
323	1	a	Came here last night with a bunch of my girlfriends and had a blast!  It's a sports bar that is a ton of fun.  The servers and bartenders are a lot of fun, and we get to know the owner as well.  The owner came put to check on us regularly and is super cool.  The food was amazing too.  The chili is the best I have ever eaten. \n\nThe drink pours were very generous and the bill didn't kill us at the end of the night (that's always a relief and will keep us coming back).\n\nGive cogburns a try, you'll have fun!
324	1	a	Great wings.  Great atmosphere. Lots of tv's for games and tons of seating. Will be back to watch the Broncos games!
325	0	a	The wings are terrible! They did not have very good flavor. They were giant and didn't seem to have enough sauce. It was hard to even try to get the chicken off the bone. Not that we really wanted to since the taste was so bad but we had already purchased them so felt obligated to eat them. I do not suggest this restaurant to anybody.
326	0	a	My wife and I visited this place a few weeks ago, not sure if they had been open very long.  I am guessing by the quality of service, they were still breaking in. Ordered wings, salads and a few draft beers.  My wife's beer was flat, and it took 15 minutes to swap kegs for my beer.  Menu price was different then what the wait staff told us.  I guess there was a mis print on the menu and they explained it would be more expensive then what the menu stated. (I'm guessing they could have had it corrected, reprinted, redacted, ) and just honored the price. (Am I to critical?) We were seated in the very lower level with very little air circulation.  The wing sauce was not what I was used to, it was ok but not that red thick wing sauce.  Wings were big and juicy. We plan to revisit once the kinks are worked out.
327	1	a	"Food and atmosphere gets a four and I will def be coming back for their PILED HIGH nachos and they weren't kidding with their HUGE \""big wings\"" delish! \n\nI give service a 5 star to my waitress (which I am so sad I can't remember her name) with blonde hair and a flannel around her waist for being so attentive to my boyfriend and was super polite, not to mention I always had a cold brew in front of me! If your reading this blondie you rock!!!! Thank you!"
328	0	a	Went in today because it was a recommendation from one of my wife's coworkers to go try this place. I love wings one of my most favorite things to eat which is what this places is supposedly famous for. The wings weren't as big as the menu claims even though they did have a lot of meat on them. The ranch and sauce covering the wings were very thin and runny as well as I when I asked for the hottest ones they had they compared to a medium sauce anywhere else I've been. I did enjoy the friendly service which never let my cup get half empty and the batter dipped onion rings which are another one of my favorite things to snack on. I would recommend the onion rings and the service but not much else about the place.
329	1	a	Saturday specials include $2.25 domestic bottles and $3 pizza slices. Pizza slice is pretty big, not bad for 3 bucks. Place is clean with a ton of TVs. Turkado sandwich was good. Onion rings are wonderful!
330	0	a	"Decided to check this place out when we had a few hours without the kid.  I've had their wings before at a wing festival and really enjoyed them.  However, this experience started out poorly as we waited almost 15 minutes for anyone to come and take our drink order. \n\nWhen we finally were able to put our food order in I ordered a burger, the wife ordered a chicken sandwich and we also ordered some wings to share.  Apparently there were other people working there besides the bartender because a runner brought the food.  She said she would bring us silverware and brought 1 set.  Even though my wife had a sandwich and might not have needed a fork a napkin for her would have been nice since we were sharing wings.  Additionally, the wings did not come with ranch like the menu says they do so I had to ask for that and the girl's reaction almost read to me like \""darn they realized there wasn't ranch with the wings\"".  \n\nAs for the quality of the food, the wings were dry and tough.  Not how I remembered them.  The burger was solid.  My wife really liked the chicken sandwich and said it was juicy and tender.  \n\nOverall the food was average to slightly above average but the service left a lost to be desired.  Most irritating was while waiting to find someone to ask for our check I saw no less than 5 other girls walking back and forth through the bar and, even worse, witnessed the manager carry on conversations with people at the bar for 10+ minutes.  \n\nOn our way out there were at least 5 employees standing around a register doing nothing.  That would explain why there was no one else around besides the bartender.  \n\nI felt bad for the bartender.  I don't know if someone called out, if they were short staffed, or they just didn't put enough people on the schedule but whatever it was the service was a giant turnoff."
331	1	a	I like this place allot, great view of the screens for sports and if the bar is full just go to the upper deck seating and you are still part of the fun. Real reasonable prices and the staff is great. This is the power and Ray location and we NEEDED a bar like this in this area. They also have a great family section that is split away from the main bar so you can bring your family. The waitresses are all cute, fit and wear their traditional daisy dukes shorts but not too overboard so it is still kid friendly and classy. Not like a hooters. Have fun I enjoy this place, hope it helps.
332	0	a	I was so excited to go to this place especially for their 40 cent wing night. What a let down!
333	0	a	We keep going and trying this locations and service is horrible the food is pretty good but it takes 45 minutes to get a drink and longer to get food management does nothing to correct the problem hope u have better luck then we have
334	0	a	Dive bar.. Enough said.. dirty and lacking direction, seems like just a place to get drunk and scream at the games on TV... Boring, wont be back.. slso, what is the strange smell in this place?
335	0	a	My girlfriend, the kids and I went here for lunch today.  The food wasn't anything significant to write home about, but wasn't bad, however not worth the prices they charge.\n\nWhere this location really has its problem is with its service.  The only thing they were really attentive on was refilling our drinks (2 sodas and 3 waters).  All of our food came out sporadically and at the same time.  We ordered both appetizers and lunches.  The food basically came to the table in one rush rather than the appetizers coming out first and then the meals as is commonplace in most restaurants.  They also charge for every little thing.  Want a side of BBQ sauce because the sliders are too dry, an extra ranch, etc. And you're looking at 50 cents a pop.\n\nGoing forward, I won't be coming back to this location.  I can get better service and prices for much better food at Flipside, Native Wings and things, The Reef, Zipps and other places in the area.
336	0	a	Aaaawful service.  Literally would have had a pack of me monkeys remember more of any thing I ordered.  Yes, it requires silverware to eat a salad.  No, I shouldn't have to ask.  Food is just . . . Meh.  I really wish this place was better, based on location.  They're screwing up a huge opportunity.
337	0	a	Arrived at 6:55 on Monday evening and asked to be seated downstairs.  After 10 minutes to be acknowledged came upstairs and asked if we needed to sit elsewhere to be waited on.  After 5 more minutes waitress shows up and says she didn't know this was her table although she seemed to have all the tables downstairs.  Finally ordered.  It was cheeseburger special night but the place wasn't crowded.  Seemed to be more waitresses than customers but also seemed to be too many chiefs and not enough Indians among the wait staff.   We ordered 3 cheeseburgers which you would expect should come out fairly quickly on cheeseburger special night.  Not.  We waited and waited and waited and finally at 7:47 we had had enough and got up and left telling the girl at the check stand that we thought 52 minutes was more than long enough to wait.  She didn't seem too concerned.  This is my second visit and have yet to see anyone who appeared to be a manager.  It is a shame that people spend a lot of money to open a place and then put teenagers working who could care less about the business.
338	0	a	Pros:\n The interior is very well designed, the atmosphere is fun, the food is good, and the staff is friendly. \n\nCons:\nThe service is very slow\n\nI go in often on my lunch break and more than once I've waited over 30 minutes for my order to come out. This is in the middle of the afternoon when the place is practically empty and the food still takes forever and a day to arrive. \n\nWhen they are busy, ordering or having a drink refilled can take over 20 minutes;  and we all know that nothing kills a good time faster then waiting an eternity for another drink. The last time I went in here (on a Thursday night) I told the waitress I needed a minute to look over the menu; she left me and never came back. I spent over an hour sipping a beer with a menu in front of me and never even had an opportunity to place my order. In fact, I didn't see my original server again all night as another waitress brought me my check.\n\n I see a lot of potential in this place, they are friendly, fun, and IMHO a great place to hang out but they need to get on point with their service or I'm going to find another place to spend my time.
339	1	a	Cheap Mid-Eastern, Mediterranean -style fast food, prices very reasonable- WHOLE grilled chicken only $14.99,cheapest I' ve seen in city yet. We ordered at the counter,I had paella with a side of green beans Mediterranean -style ,but the food was barely warm. The dessert pudding was really yum though. This place just opened,so I expect they'll fine tune this at some point. Two floors, they can accommodate groups for private parties, and it's a bring your own wine joint to boot. Not too bad a choice for cheap eats downtown.
340	1	a	My husband and I went to have lunch there by far the best colombian food! Best empanadas and Natural juices! And the service is awesome I just hope it stays like that! So far I love it!
341	0	a	La carte est cool mais pas le go\u00fbt . Seul le dessert est bon g\u00e2teau carotte . \u00c9viter les expresso
342	0	a	I had been getting approach by other banks to refinance because I have 700+ credit score and the equity on my house went up $90,000 since I bought on 2009 with the lowest rate offered back then 5.375. Instead of changing banks I decided to apply at Desert Schools at Arrowhead, where I've been banking for many years,  paid off a couple of car loans and they also hold my current mortgage loan since 2009. I'm very disappointed on the service this time, I am trying to refinance to a 15 yr loan with a 3.5% rate. I agree to the fees and I've been providing all the documents they ask for and I'm still getting the run around.  I was told we could Close by 07/27... and now the people that was helping me with the new loan are out on Vacation until 07/28.  Now I'm having to answer the same questions to different people that just took over for the week.  They are again for the twentieth time asking me about why my over time was different 3 years ago!, when it's pretty clear on all my pay stubs and W2s that my pay has not gone down at all... but they questioning about the same stuff like if they don't want to let me close the new loan any time soon.  I hold the same job for 8 years,  Don't have any past due account... and they have all my car loans, checking and savings accounts for over 9 years. ...  why can they refinance my loan to a lower rate if I qualify? ???....  is it just because they loose money or their underwriter is a retarded person that can't figure out that the reason my total pay for the year doesn't equal to last year's is because it's only July! !!..  are they really going to make me wait til the end of the year just to see that I was right and my salary didn't go down. ...????!!!!*&\u20ac%\u00f7\u00d7?
343	0	a	This small and new hotel is located across from several busy late night bars and restaurants. IT IS TOO LOUD SO DON'T EXPECT A GOOD NIGHT'S SLEEP.  AIR CONDITIONING DOESN'T WORK IN SUITES.  MANAGEMENT WAS RUDE (told me I could check out if I dont like the noise and bad air, though it was 11:30 pm when I discovered these problems -ARE YOU KIDDING?!!) . Anyway , obviously off to a crappy start when the hotel like this should be bending over backwards to attract new clientele.  At this rate, it will be closed quickly as it opened and it will be a blessing. \n\nIn short, don't stay here unless you have no other option apart from hitting yourself over the head with a mallet.
344	1	a	WELCOME to the neighborhood THE PINT!! Great spot for Great Gaming...Good Food..Awesome Service..Fun Atmosphere!
345	0	a	The first time we were there the service was awesome, the owner was working behind the bar and he really takes care of you and tends the bar well. We never had to ask for a drink and he recommended some great beers. On our second visit we were quite disappointed,  it took way too long to even get a knowledged and i played $100 dollars on the machine before i got my first beer, the guy next to me got smart and just ordered two at a time because they were taking so long granted the bar was kind of busy but the bartenders didnt have any urgency. I like this place and ill give it another shot just because its something diff since we are always going to redrock but ill def only be staying if i see the right people working.
346	0	a	They left the shitty machine in from the old place.  The bar does look better. I have to agree with others about the smoking.
347	1	a	"My girl and I came here a couple days after opening. It looked way better than the bar before it and the food was much better as well. They have a bunch of really cool options like an \""adult\"" grilled cheese sandwich and a twist on bacon wrapped dates. \n\nThe bartenders were extremely attentive and the place had a super happy vibe. Our bartender, Jordan, was on top of it and even helped us out when an order came out wrong, which tends to happen when a place is only a couple days old. \n\nThe only critique I would make is that I would like to see crazier beers here (sour beer and more Belgian stuff.)\n\nAll in all, it was a really cool bar close to my house and I will be back soon."
348	1	a	I was very pleased to see a nice and clean sports bar here in summerlin. The pint has about 11 Tvs, a pool table, golf machine and  even a pretty modern junk box. There are also several slot machines throughout out the bar. \nWhat I enjoyed the most was the large selection of beers and mix drinks. The snake bite and the Michelada beer were great! We ordered the da brat and the bacon wrapped dates, which were better than your normal bar. \nWe had the opportunity to talk to Nick who is the guy in charge. He was very friendly and attentive! He and his team tried to provide us great customer service by checking on us on a regular basis!\nIf you are looking for a clean and laid back sports bar, this is definitely the place to go\nThe only bad part is that the bar was too smokey!
349	1	a	Omg the fish and chips get it !!!!!  Fucking love this place everyone is so nice and service is on point
350	1	a	Love this place. Perfect spot to watch the game. Big HDTVs very well-sized for the space - this is not always the case, so it's worth mentioning. Reasonably-priced, good beer selections (including local brews) and super friendly staff.\n\nThe strong ventilation system was much appreciated as there were a few smokers at the bar. We left smelling like roses (Go Blue!)\n\nI didn't have food, but I spied on others' and it did look tasty. \n\nFunny-as-shit men's bathroom mural, too. I won't spoil it.\n\nParking is not easily visible from the bar, so leave your classic (or Ferrari) at home. Yes, I always consider the parking situation ;)
351	1	a	I like the transformation they've done here. It's much more upscale than the prior bar. They have a decent beer selection. We were very pleased to see Anchor Steam on tap. There are a few different video poker options including triple play. I've been here a few times and they seem understaffed. It does take a bit to get your drink.
352	0	a	"This is solely my review of the place and I wasn't impressed one bit. For a place being called the \""Pint\"" the beer selection is better than the average bar but not nearly what I thought it would/should be. The place was dead, our server/waitress kept checking on us and was very attentive so A+ for her. \nThe biggest complaint I have was the haze of smoke the floated the air like a fog machine. I know I know it's a bar and people smoke in bars... Well I don't smoke and I don't want to go into a bar leaving and feeling like a smoked a carton."
353	1	a	Stopped by for the grand opening and I couldn't have asked for a better spot in the area to grab a cold pressed juice!\n\nIt just opened, and although I don't live in the area, it's worth driving out here because the staff actually knows what they're talking about, and actually care about your health and well-being.\n\nI had Ava's Juice Box - which had pear and fennel. Holy cow. I'd never even thought of this combo, so 5 stars for ingenuity and making me feel good after.\n\nNot sure what that previous review is all about, so disregard someone who has never written a yelp review and starts hating on a spot.\n\nI would absolutely come back and you should too!
354	1	a	Stopped in this past weekend to see how the newest Juice spot in town sizes up.  Was so surprised at the diverse menu inclusive of some INCREDIBLE raw cacao treats and almond milkshakes, thank you Juice NV for a healthy alternative to my sweet tooth....oh yeah I came back for more on Sunday...Nailed it!
355	0	a	I had been waiting for this place to open, but I'm am pretty disappointed. The prices seem outrageous. $10 for a juice? We went in on the first day, I expected there may be some disorganization due to being brand new, but everything seemed to be in order. There was at least 3 employees behind the counter. \n\nThe staff was very nice. While we were looking over the menu one of the girls came over to us. She wanted to answer any questions we might of had, but honestly both of us were kind of surprised at the $10 per juice thing. We couldn't really get past it. \n\nAnother group walked in, and back out again while we were there. After checking the menu out for a bit, we decided to leave and go across the street to our old standby. Prices were far more reasonable at The Protein House, so I think we'll stick with them and Greens & Proteins. The juice price here is higher than Whole Foods prices. That's Crazy!
356	1	a	Had my first Juice NV smoothie yesterday.  It was delicious and very satisfying!!!  Pineapple Jungle will not disappoint!!\nThe store design adds to the total experience....I left the stress of the hot day at the door...
357	1	a	This past weekend, I stopped by this spot since I saw the Grand Opening sign and some people were raving about it on Yelp.\n\nLet me tell you...this place is amazing! I don't usually go out to spots just to buy juice, except for one juice cleanse earlier this year. All that will change.\n\nThe staff was warm and friendly, and answered all my questions. They gave me a bunch of samples, told me about the benefits of each juice, and then I ultimately settled on the Unicorn's Blood. It was delicious. I can't stress enough how great it was to get my juicing questions answered. It makes the whole ordering process less stressful.\n\nSide note, I did a juice cleanse earlier this year. I really wish Juice NV was open back then, but my next one will be great because I can get everything freshly made!\n\nReturn Factor: IMMEDIATE!
358	1	a	Was waiting for this place to open for a long time! I was so pleasantly amazed how big is their variety of juices! The stuff was friendly and knowledgeable and let me sample all of the juices. I tried their tuna sandwich, Im not vegan and was kinda suspicious about trying vegan food, but that sandwich tasted exactly like tuna sandwich and when I heard how good it was for me I got one more to go! Definitely will go back to get more juices and thinking of doing their juice cleanse. Oh and they have guilt free desserts! That's pretty amazing!
359	1	a	I'm not one to eat healthy by any means but had always wanted to try a cold pressed juice so when Juice NV opened I finally made my way down during their grand opening weekend to give my taste buds something new to try.  The space itself is very sleek and sophisticated.  There were 2 staff behind the counter who were extremely friendly and knowledgeable.  They let me sample all their juices and gave a detailed explanation of each juice and its benefits.  They have a wonderful selection of cold pressed juices and even have sweets to go! My favorite was the carrot top with unicorns blood and green w nv being close seconds.  I also had the avocado/pesto sandwich and quinoa salad and took a strawberry flavored smoothie for the road.  Knowing you can indulge in such great tasting food items and be healthy at the same time is a welcome change to my diet.  Juice NV is definitely going to be part of my weekly food stops to go.
360	1	a	"My FAV new juice spot!!! Amazing fresh cold pressed juices... With unique choices and yummy food options. Jermaine came out from the kitchen to explain all the different options and health benefits of all the juices, which was a nice touch. My fav juice is \""Beets by Waits\"""
361	0	a	I have been waiting for this place to open, but when I left I was really disappointed. I spent 42.00 on a smoothie, 2 drinks and truffles. The smoothie was delicious. The truffles were absolutely horrible. Then I got two drinks the unicorns blood and a green one and they are absolutely disgusting I and so disappointed because they were way over priced but I chose to try them anyway. The staff was extremely wonderful and helpful while I was there. It is the drinks and dessert I disliked.
362	1	a	I'm note a default here and stop daily.  It's pricey but I believe my health is worth it.  Note:  they will be coming out with punch cards so you can earn free juices.
363	1	a	I love this concept! Coupled with their friendly and knowledgeable staff, this is a terrific place with tons of healthy options! Their chia seed pudding is excellent as are all of the juices I have tried (which is most). The only reason I am giving them 4 stars is because I wish they had an incentive program with their juice bottles and/or offered a discount when you bought a certain amount of products. Overall I am a huge fan.
364	0	a	If you are craving a fresh squeezed juice this is not the place. Comes in a plastic bottle! They  pre juice it. As you know fresh juice loses its potency the longer it sits around, especially in a plastic bottle. Ok, the place says they open at 7am but I got there at 8 and the doors were locked. From the outside it looks closed with dark windows and no appeal. When you walk in, it's clean but the women behind the counter talks to you like this is the biggest thing to hit Vegas, lol, it's juice in a plastic bottle no matter how you try and explain it to me. I am from LA and been juicing for 20 years. The juices start at 9.99 a bottle and go up. I do not mind paying the money but I better see you extracting right into my cup! 1 star for cleanliness and mediocre juicing. Whole foods, here I come!!
365	1	a	Their staff are all so friendly and helpful. They are very eager to help you and answer any questions you might have. \nI am not a frequent juicer because it is just too much work to juice at home... the preparation and clean up is just too much for me to justify. Which is why I love that juicerys are finally opening up in Vegas.\n\nThe prices here are reasonable...around 10$ a juice with a ton of options for you to choose from. Unicorn's Blood is delicious! I see a lot of people have an issue with the fact that they bottle their juices, but I actually love that. I am there to grab what I need and go. If I wanted to watch a my juice be made in front of me, I'd do it at home. \n\nI'll definitely be back.
366	1	a	What a great experience is was coming to this juice store. From the minute walking in the door the girl behind the counter was extremely friendly and out going. I was unsure on what to order so she offered me several different varieties in both juices and the sandwiches. I chose the green Mary drink and the avocado sandwich. Both of which were delicious and extremely filling. In my opinion if you are going to enjoy a sandwich chose the other green drink, not the green Mary.... It's a meal within itself.
367	1	a	This place opened about a month ago, but it's our first visit here. The owner was very nice, and they have a great selection of dog accessories, treats and food. When it gets a little cooler, i'll be bringing my dog to shop here and then eat next door at crepe expectations!
368	0	a	They butchered my yorkie I asked for a trim about  an inch off.. she wasnt matted or anything she just needed to be cleaned and reshaped. They said ok. I dropped her off at 12:30 and didn't  get called till 4. \nWhen  I get there  my dog is shaved!!!!! Mind u its winter and now she is bald... oh well.
369	1	a	French Nails is such a comfortable salon!  The services are great and everybody is so friendly and welcoming.  Victoria is such a sweetheart and I love chit chatting with her!  I look forward to every appointment I have with her! \n\nBy far one of my favorite nail salons!  I don't live close but am happy to go out of my way to have such a great service!
370	1	a	Wonderful food. Peaceful and quiet atmosphere. Chen, the owner is incredibly hospitable. Don't be fooled by the shabby exterior, its well worth a visit.
371	0	a	Just tried the Chinese food which was mediocre at best by my picky standards. Maybe the sushi would have been better. \n\nThis location was originally home to Yen's for many years- an exceptional neighborhood Chinese restaurant which closed about a year ago due to illness. My expectations were no doubt high and unfortunately not met. \n\nI used to make a 20 minute drive for Yen's but don't expect to do the same for Mr Wok.\nBut try it yourself if you're in the area and write a review to confirm or deny my experience.
372	0	a	First time into this new establishment with it's obvious growing pains. Training staff and getting the products right for which they have aways to go.\n\nI've spent a significant amount of time in the south having had excellent to fair Mexican food. I believe in doing the foods heritage right or not at all.\n\nRats I lost the only two pictures of my three hardshell taco order. I don't think it was the apps fault rather mine for not rebooting the SGN2 for several weeks.\n\nThe ambiance: not Mexican, nor a first date eatery unless she has a great sence of humour, very forgiving, madly in love with you or any combination thus stated. Females and wimpy men beware, it is well airconditioed, which apparently only I do appreciate.  \n\nFood order: three hardshell taco, fish, spicy* pork and chicken. *spicy for white people who want to feel ethnic. Fish, one small piece but tasty. The chicken and pork portions were more generous.\n\nToppings: the tomatoes, lettuce and cilantro were fresh. The guacamole Is just mashed a vacation maybe with some mayo, it was underwhelming in being part of a (fish) taco. As a side dish it would have better value. By the time the Toppings are into the shells the paper lined basket looks like a major size salad.\n\nThe problem: I noticed when the server was building each taco. That the meats with exception to the fish had too much moisture. The tomatoe and corn were dripping wet and the hardshells are very thin. By the time I started into the third taco, just picking it up I knew it was finished and one bite later it fell completely apart. The Toppings were fridge cold while biting into a warm bottom. Admittedly I've never experienced this sensation before in any real Mexican eatery. I now had a salad bowl with a soggy broken taco shell, oh joy oh bliss, not.\n\nThe manager: I politely commaned the owners presence to discuss the above. To his credit he offered a discount, then to replace the taco, and I suggested he replace the shell and I'll scoop the amassed mixture back into the new shell. He was visably pleased with the solution. He admitted that the hardshells are too thin and the supplier is looking to rectify the problem. He on the other hand was surprised about the too much moisture content being the biggest contributor to the problem. Really test, test, test and verify is not just a neat saying common to the military, engineering or computer industry and yes the food industry.\n\nConclusion: returning to the task-at-hand I'd been given a deformed taco but plodded ahead anyway.  There was more than enough taco meat and salad to make two. With fork in hand I cowed down like Jethro Bodine over his gargantuan bowl of cereal.\nI left feeling very full, with a very mild buzz on my lips and the wonderful taste of fresh cilantro upon the tongue. Hopefully the owner, btw a very nice guy, learns and fixes things quickly. Creating and cooking from fresh real cantina mexican would elevate a much needed catagory and create a loyal following I'm sure.\n\nCost: 3 hardshell tacos fish, spicy pork and chicken without extras or drinks, $10.34 taxes included. Billed as three fish tacos.
373	0	a	"So this was a \""fine\"" fast food burrito. Neither good nor bad. The taste was alright, despite certain issues of carelessness. First, the server did not drain liquid off of items (beans, tomatoes, corn) before adding them to my burrito, leaving unappetizing and ultimately messy puddles in the tortilla, and in prep, no one cut off the stems of the cilantro, leaving an unpleasant stem texture in many bites. \n\nThough I didn't ask for a manager, my impression was that there was none on site by the way the staff were acting out of sight but well within earshot. Topics of conversation and language used just behind the dividing wall made it clear that either some staff don't understand that they can be heard even if they can't be seen - or they don't care..  It was bizarre.\n\nI can't help but NOT be surprised by inappropriate language by staff in a restaurant that thought it appropriate to call its largest size burrito \""big ass\"". I am the last person to be accused of being politically correct, but even I found it unnecessary, and thus inappropriate. Want to joke about the size, call it \""huge\"". No one wants to eat something that they called \""ass\"". Not me, at least. \n\nOverall, the other 2 customers in the restaurant seemed satisfied with their sandwiches (I asked when I walked in) but one of them did me a favour when he said that Quesada is \""not Chipotle\"". Thankfully, that lowered my expectation just enough to enjoy this sandwich. \n\nDespite an average meal that wasn't horrible, I can't take a restaurant that has a menu size called \""big ass\"". That, and the complete lack of any thoughtful design in the restaurant makes me round 2 1/2 stars DOWN rather than up. \n\nI know they're new in this location, but this is not a new business. They need to rethink things and take their business seriously if they want people like me to think of them as a viable fast food competitor. Right now, the carelessness and the poor decisions just leave me thinking of them as a joke."
374	0	a	Five months and a bit I was curious to see if this new Mexican eatery had upped its game. Sadly no.\n\nThe quesadilla, steak, all dressed without lettuce as it would make the quesadilla too soggy, I was told. The counter person a very nice young lady toasted it to perfection. At the table I tried lifting one of the pieces barley making any of it to my anxious tongue. From the counter to my seat it had gone soggy even without the damned lettuce. So with plastic cutlery now in hand and grumpy in charge I ate to stuffed this self deconstructing, moderately flavourful quesadilla.\n\nLike I've said many times, if you're going to do food do it right or not at all. You otherwise embarrass yourself, make a mockery of it origines, disrespect the ethnicity of the people and insult the pallet of those who have refined taste buds and knowledge of various cultures. Oh yes and You embarrass Yourself!\n\nOn the bright side quesadillas were half price. $4,54 tax in and I was not hungry afterward, just wanting real Mexican food.
375	1	a	We just had dinner there and the food was great ( chicken kabab and ghormehsabzi). :)
376	0	a	Barg kabab was like a pice of rubber. And it's interesting that they charged us and when we complained they said come back again we will serve you better food. I NEVER Recommend this restaurant.
377	1	a	The food is wonderful! Also, the map is wrong, but the address is right. This is on flamingo and Torrey pines behind Archie's Thai kitchen (not tropicana).
378	0	a	Did not like the food. My friends had lentils + beef , they did not like it. These folks dont know how to even serve drinks.\n\nWould not recommend.
379	0	a	I'm not sure why this place has 5 star reviews. I can guess they're from friends and family of the owner as a desperate attempt to stay in business.\n\nAnyway, the food was so disappointing. It was bland. When I go to a Persian place, I expect the flavors to be intense...or at least present. The food I had was a huge let down. After liberally applying salt and pepper, the food still had no taste. What a let down. :( My boyfriend's beef kabob was also bland. I could make it better at home. The food I ordered (some sort of rice layered chicken dish) looked like it was made the day before and just reheated then served to me. \n\nThe interior was also strange. Looks outdated and mismatched. There were only two other parties there besides us. Guess their huge room with tons of tables set up just gather dust. The atmosphere was a bit weird and uncomfortable. \n\nThe only reason I gave it a two star review instead of one was because the waitress was very nice.
380	0	a	The food here is really bad. It's made by Arabic people there cooking Persian food. it's very tasteless the rice is horrible don't come here
381	1	a	Just a short note to say thank you Clayton for the amazing customer service and great job you did fixing my home AC unit! This was a much easier process that I thought it was going to be. Thank you very much and I will recommend your services in the future.
382	1	a	We had several Bids because the  tech and YES Air Conditioning said we had a crack in our furnace.. causing a carbon Monoxide leak. We went for a week without heat. YES Bid over 9000 for a Rheem system.\n  Leo Murrieta of Phoenix came over to give a competitive bid ( three companies had already come out after the YES diagnostic and gave bids for a cracked furnace ) \nLeo looked and thought something was odd.. and sent another tech out ( an no charge to us ) to open up the furnace. No one else did that.\nThere was NO LEAK NO CRACK... Leo said we had a good furnace , it and our AC system was probably good for another two years. He gave us a bid of 8000 for a TOP of the line Trane system... but said we wernt ready.\nPHOENIX AC  actually left a 8000 sale on the table because they were HONEST and ETHICAL !!\n\nPLEASE, REWARD THIS GREAT COMPANY FOR THEIR ETHICAL BUSINESS PRACTICES..\n\ndo NOT  repeat DO NOT  .. hire YES , ARS, Quality AC, or Rightnowair. Especially YES. They WILL scam you, overcharge you, and rip you off.\n\n( Quality agreed  there was a crack, their tech was inept and rude.... RightNowAir tech was very nice and seemed knowledgeable.. but agreed with the other two.. he ALMOST got the business.. but now, NO )\n\nGood Job to Phoenix AC and the LEO Murrieta for his Honesty, helpfulness, and ethics.
383	1	a	Had a leaky water softener.  Called them about 9am on Friday September 12, 2014.  The man said they were very busy that day, but would try to get someone over there as if possible.  He told me the leak was bad and seemed concerned about it getting worse.\nIt was after 4pm and I figured they weren't coming that day.  I thought they would hopefully be able to make it the next day.  But, to my surprise, I got a call from Carl with Reidhead Plumbing and he said he was on the way.  I thought after 4pm, no plumber is going to start a job.  Well, he did.  And he finished it quickly.  Took out the old water softener and installed a new water softener that we had purchased.\nReidhead Plumbing exceeded expectations by showing up when I expected to have to wait another day.  They did the job quickly and well. I write this five days later - no leaks or problems with the new water softener.  And, at a price that was less than the other two quotes I received.
384	1	a	I had a problem with my kitchen sink come up where I needed the water values under my sink replaced asap and needed a new disposer put in.  I called mid-afternoon and talked to Lena who told me they were busy that day but set me up first thing the next day. Thirty minutes later Lena called back and told me they had a man in my area that could come immediately. Marshall was knowledgeable, quick and efficient, and went the extra mile by using my existing hose because my new disposer I ordered didn't come with one. I'll definitely use them again.
385	1	a	Had the greek pizza here yesterday. Very impressed with the service and the food. Very good pizza for a bar. My fianc\u00e9 liked the Club Sandwich that we got to go.
386	1	a	David has a very nice shop that can accommodate all your needs.  He carries a nice line of AUTHENTIC mods which is a nice change.  He also has a great selection of quality clones.  After buying a couple of rba's, he took the time to build the coil for us along with great instruction on care and how to build ourselves.  Also has an awesome juice selection!  He never made my wife and I feel rushed and answered all of our questions.  There are a lot of options in Vegas, but we will be loyal customers to this shop now.
387	1	a	This was my first time ever in a vape shop. So I didn't really know anything about vapping or the like. Manny (the gentleman working) explained everything to me and answered all my questions. He explained the difference between a start up set and the modded sets. He was a huge help and I will be stopping back by whenever I need questions answered. \n\nOn top of all that they seem to make their own liquids at the shop which is awesome. It's unique and helps set this shop apart from basic shops. \n\nI highly recommend coming by this shop and I will definitely be stopping by here more often!
388	1	a	Great Time!! Funny movie!! Loved going to the Film Bar for the first time! The tables so you can eat are fantastic!
389	1	a	"Another great time at the August showing of \""Raising Arizona.\"" How much fun is this place? Thanks Lindsey."
390	1	a	It was my first time at the FilmBar and what a way to see a show. First stop was in the parking lot at the ShortLeash Food truck another first time for me! So many good choices,I went with the  Spicy Beer Hot, Lady style of course!Curled up in a pita(no buns here) and topped with fried pickle slices, smothered in chipotle cream cheese, Oh it was tasty but hold the onions please...a lady has to breathe! Once inside we received a beverage ticket,I chose a refreshing Peach Ale, the perfect pairing to my meal and another first for me! The Secret Movie of the evening was Raising Arizona. What a better way to watch it than surrounded by some of my favorite Yelp Peeps,YelpCorn bags filled with candy, and seeing it on the big screen was a lot funnier than I'd remembered watching it back in the day on TV. Thank you to Lindsey, ShortLeash, and to the FilmBar, it was a fabulous event filled with a lot of firsts, but it definitely won't be my last!\nP.S. When you're in Cenpho come prepared to pay for those meters,thanks to those 2 lovely ladies who shared their change & to the City of Phoenix for only giving me a warning!
391	1	a	"Had a great time tonight at Yelp's Secret Cinema!  Thanks so much Lindsey and FilmBar for hosting us.  \n\nWe'd spent some time researching possible \""filmed in Arizona\"" movies and our guesses were Star Wars or Casablanca.  Boy were we wrong.  FilmBar treated us with a blast back to the 80s with \""Just Another Guy.\""  I can't believe that this level of cheese was considered standard in movies from the 80s; some of the older Yelpers may remember the days, but this movie was actually made before I was born (and I'm pretty un-cultured), so it's pretty foreign to me.  Absolutely love it.\n\nGood beer, tasty movie popcorn, and even better company.  Can't wait for the next Made In Arizona event!"
392	1	a	"\""My life changed after Just One of the Guys. People stopped looking at my face and looked at my chest instead.\"" - Joyce Hyser\n\nNow I see what all the fuss is about! Thanks Lindsey and Film Bar for giving me a second chance to appreciate the humor, highlights, and styles that I just didn't pick up on when I was two and this Made In Arizona(tm) insta-classic hit the theaters. Plus a drink --- BRAVO!\n\nSuch a fun event and, as a new Elite, a good chance to visit with the other attendees. Really looking forward to the next one."
393	1	a	"This was my first time at Filmbar, I have been wanting to come and was on my bookmarks for over a year.  This was a fun event, I loved being able to chat with fellow yelpers and then enjoy an old movie.  It was so funny to watch again an old 80's movie.  Great acting, I guess that is why we never heard of them again.  It was a lot of fun to comment on some of the lines.  What a great and inventive event.  Short Leash truck was outside offering their yummy goods.  It was good to know they offered their dogs \""naked\"" since I'm on a no carb diet right now.\nThank you Lindsey and the staff at Filmbar for having us over to enjoy a night full of entertainment.."
394	1	a	"Films! Films! Films! Three Secret Cinemas are now under my belt and they have all been great! Not Academy Award winners, but great fun and entertaining on a large screen. How did I not know these films were \""made in Arizona\""?\n\n1. Wayne's World\n2. Just One of the Guys\n3. Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure\n4. What do you think this one will be? Shssh . . .it's a secret. Can you guess?\n\nTerrific idea for a Yelp Event and a great introduction to one of the hidden gems (well, not really hidden) in Phoenix - FilmBar.\n\nThanks Lindsey! \n\nCheck out their schedule of up coming films."
395	0	a	Placed a to go order, after placing the order I noticed the sanitary rating was not good. The food was also not good.  The generals chicken was bright orange and tough.  The hibachi chicken was ok.  The fried rice was gummy and tasteless.  \n\nThe cashier was nice but not knowledgeable.  I had to wait about 25 minutes for my order.  I will not be returning.
396	0	a	I would give this place NO star if I could.\n\nThe only nice thing was the cashier/waitress. I had dine with my boyfriend and the waitress was such a novice. Although she was nice and respectful, she knew nothing about the menu and kept going to the back to ask the manager. The manager was the rudest person ever! He was yelling at her, as if we couldnt hear him, asking her what did we ordered. We had ordered something on the menu that they did not have. So why is it on the menu when you don't have it? Then we asked the other waitress to turn on the tv and she didn't know how. She asked the manager how to do it and he yells from the kitchen, again, saying he is busy. She apologized. At this point I didn't want to stay anymore. The environment and all this yelling is so disrespectful, but my boyfriend said we could at least tried the food. There were other customers coming in and later the manager comes from the back acting all nice and asking the waitress she don't know how to turn on the tv or what. So fake.\n\nWhen our food came out, the miso soup was nasty, tasted like salt water. The bulgogi was SOUR!! I mean, has anyone ever eaten sour bulgogi? Do sour bulgogi even exist? You can tell there was a lot of MSG. The salmon roll was small and tasteless. The food was definitely not worth the money and pricing.\n\nI thought cho won garden was bad; this place is the worst.\n\nOne more thing, there's no sushi bar.
397	0	a	Sushi bar?, japanese, and Korean =Terrible, Terrible, and Terrible. Food is tasteless. Chef attitude is terrible. I'm not going back to bob zip waste of money and my time.
398	1	a	this was my first time eating bob zip's food but all i can say is i'm impressed. i'm a vegetarian that loves sushi so finding a good  Japanese and sushi place with a lot of vegetarian options is hard, but this place has so options. i had the veggie rolls and they are some of the best i've tasted. i saw a lot of the reviews were negative but i see no reason why. the place is kind of small but most of my sushi orders are takeout so that isn't a problem. i'll definitely be visiting again to try some of their other options.
399	1	a	"I live close by and just placed my first order this evening - hibachi chicken.  I was very pleased with my meal...lots of nice white chicken with lots of veggies!  It came with an abundant amount of rice as well as two dipping sauces and soup.  I am so happy to have this place so close.  It is definitely my new \""go to\"" place!!!  I think the less fanatic reviews were probably from when they first opened and had a learning curve.  Definitely worth trying!!!"
400	0	a	The place must have been sold again.  It was a great place but I went there for lunch today.  My wife and I ordered the same thing which said it came with soup.  It did not specify which soup it only says soup.  As we have always ordered we ordered the hot and sour soup which was never a problem under the old ownership.  The waiter came back to us and said we can only have the Miso soup.  I do not like Miso so I said it does not say that on the menu.  He went back to the kitchen and the owner was very adamant that even though it does not specify this we can only have the Miso soup.  My wife and I said no Miso for you and walked out and we will not be coming back.  The owner's attitude was he would rather lose a customer than provide what we ordered and have ordered every other time we went.  The food used to be good but with such bad service we will go to one of the other ten different Asian places that would gladly offer us Hot and Sour Soup if that is what we wanted.  It was a weird experience.
401	1	a	Giant restaurant, two bars, gaming tables, and broiler right in the middle of the dining room. Very friendly service. Great liquor selection, but skip the $20 gin & tonic. Excited to go again and try other things.
402	1	a	Had the best most tender steak of my life at try bazaar meat.  Some kind of aged beef sent from heaven!
403	1	a	Extremely happy The Bazaar has come to Las Vegas. I've missed the cotton candy fois gras dearly, and probably had a year's worth in one meal to make up for it. A few things are different, and there's an overwhelming amount of meat choices, which is wonderful. Not a big fan of the nori meat tacos, I think the anago cucumber ones in LA are better. Also, the Philly cheesesteaks are missing too, which was a bummer. But, the wagyu beef was on point, the wine list is solid, the patisserie tasty, and everything else was great. Glad the Magic Mojito made the cut too!
404	0	a	I don't know why I continue to waste hundreds of dollars at SBE restaurants when I've never liked a single one. I keep hoping they're going to live up to the hype and they never do. The only reason I'm giving them two stars instead of one is that for once, the server didn't act like we were privileged to be dining there like they do all ALL the SBE restaurants in LA. She was actually friendly and nice, not snooty.\n\nFirst, I called for a reservation 10 days in advance after seeing nothing available on the day we wanted (Friday 9/5) on Open Table. The girl on the phone said nothing was available until Tuesday 9/9. A few days later, I looked on Open Table and 8pm on Friday was available so I booked it.\n\nWe get there on time and the place is 70% empty. I wonder if they just keep spaces open for walk-ins, yet they don't tell you that on the phone when you try to make a reservation. The place stayed empty until about 10pm when we left.\n\nWe ordered the foie gras cotton candy, chicken croquettes, beef Carpaccio with parmesan, peanut fed serrano ham, flat iron steak with blue cheese, baby corn,  and Anna potatoes.\n\nThe foie gras, croquettes, carpaccio, and ham were good, not amazing. The flat iron steak was bland, the anna potatoes were so saltly, they were inedible. I sent them back and they still came back covered in salt. They forgot the baby corn and the steak took so long, they sent out a free gazpacho, but that wasn't good either. I didn't realize that they forgot the baby corn until hours later, but at least they didn't charge us for it.\n\nBottom line, go to Animal or Bestia in LA. You'll save a hundred dollars and have much better, creative dishes.
405	0	a	Went with five people and had a horrible experience.  We all ordered steaks and side dishes and one steak came after 30 minutes. Then after another 30 minutes another came. Then 15 minutes the rest of the meat came. After we were finished eating the steaks our four appetizers came.  Food was average and cost very expensive.  Would not go again.

Truly a daunting menu, both in actual size and scope, it was with seven friends that I sat down just moments after 7:00pm and opting for a wide variety of items marched out by a staff that only once failed by forgetting a buddy's beer I'll simply say that for such a space, particularly in Las Vegas, the service was superior - a strong credit to GM Yassine Lyoubi who greeted me during the early part of the stay.  Perhaps a bit expensive in items listed as starters, snacks, soups, and sandwiches but quick to make up for quantity with quality it was with a few small bites that I began before the rest of my group arrived and with a crispy 'air waffle' seemingly made of glass shattering to foamy foie tinged in honey I soon found myself swooning, the aggressively spiced blood sausage topped in creamy urchin that followed an equally restaurant-defining dish.  Moving next to things more substantial as I sipped a cocktail of lime, raspberry, and gin it should be abundantly obvious that S'mores laced with creamy duck liver were two-bite bits of decadence but far more surprising was the crispy pigskin, a nearly 2x2 foot sheet cracked at the table with a mallet to be dipped in Greek yogurt heavily spiced in sumac and thyme.  Moving next to a dozen fresh oysters as more drinks arrived with another \""wow\"" moment delivered by warm cheese-sticks draped in thinly sliced beef that may have represented the meal's best bite.  Onward we went, to a bowl of tripe that quickly silenced skeptics at the table with snappy lobster juxtaposing soft stomach and then to braised lamb neck paired to fried oysters that drew a similar stunned response, and with both dishes quickly finished serving platters arrived - a trio of sides including \""life affirming\"" potatoes a la Robuchon presented alongside four pounds of steak and 1/4 suckling pig with skin that crackled to the tooth.  Felt by some to be 'underseasoned,' but particularly impressive from my perspective for allowing the meat's natural flavors to shine, it was only after polishing off nearly every ounce of the scraps that we ended in espresso and dessert - the later a bit of an afterthought considering the pricetag, though the Chocolate and Aged Rum Cake and Pierre Herme inspired pastry are certainly worth the splurge.\n\nUndoubtedly one of the year's splashiest openings, only time will tell whether Bazaar Meat can maintain its early momentum but with an innovative menu and service that shines it already represents one of the best \""Steakhouses\"" in Sin City, the 25+ percent price hike on nearly every item stemming from a Las Vegas Boulevard location aside."
407	0	a	I have to say this Bazar is nothing compared to the Bazar in Beverly Hills. We came here expecting good food, class and great service. Unfortunately we were disappointed. Beverly Hills Bazar set our standards high. The Vegas one is not even close. The food was not good. It was a typical steak house. Service was mediocre. We got our oysters and side dishes after the steak. Don't go to this Bazaar expecting the great decor and class u will find in Beverly Hills.
408	0	a	"MEDIOCRE at it's finest! Fine dining without the fine dining experience! Let's talk about first the service: I didn't even know my servers name? He didn't introduce himself and he didn't even show up for a least 10 minutes when we sat down. Didn't give us a drink menu right away, sat there looking stupid because we didn't even get any recommendations all he said was \""it's good\"" he was French I presumed with an accent. \n\n We started with the beef carpaccio with the Parmesan sticks? It was good, but the sauce served with it was very salty. Tuna carpaccio was OK with a strong anchovy dressing. \n  Entrees: the Spanish seasoned rib eye was\nYummy but did take an hour to arrive (he did mention to us that it would). The PULPO was my favorite (grilled octopus) just the way I remembered when in Barcelona. The side dishes sucked!! We sent back the babycorn with the popcorn season? Was too salty, the sweet red peppers also over seasoned, I guess the Delmonico potatoes were the best! \n  I will not return, if you want a good steakhouse try Jean George's at ARIA"
409	1	a	I would give this place 3.5 stars, but because you can't, and the service, including the friendly kitchen staff, I have bumped this up to 4.  The Chicken crouquets were great.  As for the meat dishes, the quality of the meat was 5 stars.   The flavors were good but not great.  I came here with one other person but would recommend coming with a bigger group in order to sample more of the offerings.
410	0	a	Highest highs and lowest lows.  The classic tartare was the best anyone at our table had ever had.  Soooo good.  Suckling pig Sammie's were off the charts. Truly delicious. Octopus was inedible.  An unchewable mess that we sent back.  Without a doubt the least flavorful and most disappointing 200$ steak I've ever had.  How do you not season what is obviously such a high level piece of meat.  The others dining w me felt it was undercooked. I felt if was under medium rare but that's neither here nor there.  It didn't taste good.  I can do better at home.  Why did we spend $850 on dinner?
411	1	a	Delightful and delicious dinner here last week.  Really enjoyed the flavors of everything we ordered - but the standouts were really the iberico tacos and the suckling pig sandwhich.  I have no doubt I will be craving both of these on a weekly basis.  I guess just another reason to visit Vegas more often! And to note.... I recently ate at mini bar in DC and was disappointed initially that I couldn't get a spot at \u00c9 - however the meal at Bazaar was just as memorable and satiating.  Can't wait to go back!
412	0	a	"an awesome experience but i'm just not sure how to justify spending this much money for a dinner.  I had a total 5 adults that i hosted including myself.  The bar bill was likely right about $200............with that, i would assume that a NICE dinner for 5 (higher end) would run about $70-$80 per head (after all, how much can you eat)............wrong.\nMy bill was $998.  We did not eat the finest meat, we had the mid range meat.  We did not order a whole pig, we ordered 1/4 pig and we did not order lobster for everyone.  We shared three vege side dishes and 2 potato side dishes........\n\nthe food was excellent, the ambiance was inviting, service was \""ok\""........but the pricing at the end of the day is more than i can stand to pay.  you will see if you look at my profile that i eat at some decent, pricey places and don't mind paying for such.........but at some point I have to ask about value for the dollar. \n\nIf you want a show and price is no object, you will enjoy JOse.\nIf you just hit the lottery, or hit well at SLS Casino and looking to blow some money, Jose is the place.\n\nfor the average working man or even executive, it's just too pricey."
413	1	a	My wife and I visited the restaurant while we were staying at SLS Vegas.\n\nOverall, it was great experience.\nEvery dish we ordered was great, service was excellence.\n\nIf we get to visit Vegas again, we will definitely dine in again for a romantic night!
414	1	a	Overall we had a great dining experience in that everything that we ordered was very good.  The issue is the layout of the menus and how you decipher what to order.  The six in our party reviewed the menus for a while and then decided to let someone, me, take charge of figuring it out.  There are several bite-sized items to order by the piece.  Then there are tartars, carpaccios, cured meats, and shellfish selections to choose from.  The main course selections are again sized and price to share as well.  And, don't forget to order a couple of sides.  All-in-all there are some very interesting and delicious selections but it all becomes a bit overwhelming to try to figure this out as a group.  The irony is that you want to go as a group so that you can sample various things.  Our waiter was helpful in the navigation of it all.
415	0	a	A Vegas worker recommended this place and for me it's a miss. The decor was super bazaar, however, for me it doesn't tie together well. It's like being in the forest and then hunting all at the same time. Ordered the quarter pig , it was good but not worth $140. I can get the same thing back home at an Asian store for less than $20. The slices of various meat combination plate for about $70 was totally not worth it. There was only one meat that was good, the rest tasted like dry salami or sausage. The cotton candy foie gras was ok, the candy was too overwhelming. The chicken croquetas shoe presentation was unique but that was it. Tasted like fried cheese ball. Oysters were fresh, but you can get that almost anywhere. The steak was dry, I'll pass.
416	1	a	WOW, I went on a Friday night 11/21/14 and this ranks in my top 5 of all time.  Everything was Perfect!  Atmosphere, presentation, food, and SERVICE!  I like to look for the best of the best and although other reviews read differently, the night we went was one of the best nights out I have had out. \n\nI went with 6 of my  friends on a guys weekend. I will say this is a meat lovers restaurant, if you're not into the fancy, the presentation or the expensive this is not your place. But if you look for the finest then check this place out.  With one bottle of wine we were at $250 a head.  \n\nMy only complaint and not worth dinging them a star is their wine menu.  It was nice, but was over the top, over priced.  I have many of the bottles they offered in my cellar and I know I what they cost. Double or sometime Triple on high-end mark up is common, but I say 5x prices on some bottles.  I had to choose the cheapest at $160 so I could savor the meal, if I came back I'd bring my own bottle and pay the corkage. \n\nPresentation was great, portions were nice, uniqueness was great.\n\nHighly recommend.
417	0	a	"Note to Bazaar patrons:  if you write a review while in Bazaar the manager will come over and try to passive- aggressively intimidate you at your own table.\n\nI would Iike to point out to anyone on yelp that it's ok to not be into a dish and to yelp about it, even if everyone else seems to like it. This is what the Internet is all about. This was actually my second time to Bazaar and I'm still not into it. Am I a bad person for this? Perhaps. But am I entitled to my own opinion. Hell, yes I am!\n\nMy original review that upset the manager:\n\n \""Salty blahness. Although I'm not a huge fan of Spanish/Catalan food, this didn't particularly elevate it. In general, if you serve me foie gras on a stick, I'm gonna pissed. Your cotton candy silliness around a little tiny bit of foie gras is an insult to those tiny lives that died for delishiousness. \n\nHype. Hype. Hype. \n\nBest part is the music.\""\n\nI still stand by that review and no manager can help me change my mind.  I'm just not into your restaurant. Sorry. \n\nPS: staff was nice."
418	1	a	Just as delightful the second time around.  Staff is sincerely friendly and passionate about the menu - excellent service and the food was stellar.  This is how I wish every dining out experience could be.  Definitely will be back soon.
419	1	a	I was deciding between a 3 or a 4 but I've decided to give this place a 4. I think considering their quality of their meat products, I had to give it a 4. However, I would suggest you to only come in a party of 2-4 people or else you are just gonna be spending a lot and not getting full. \n\nThe wagyu tartare was okay. It's probably the 2nd best I've had but still not comparable to the one I have at Craft Steak.\nThe butter over butter over butter potato puree: ohh goodness, heart attack. It was like a fluff of cloud that you can just sleep on. Might be the best and deadliest potato puree I've had. I would like that plate to leave it spotless.\nOur waiter kept insisting we ordered the 1/4 pig and I think he might have overhyped it a bit too much. Yes, it was outstanding quality bc man they did cook it w/ perfection but it's like a roasted pig you would get at Asian restaurant where you paid 1/4 of the price. The skin was exactly like it but the meat were 8x better. I didn't know you can make a pork so juicy. However, I wouldn't recommend it. It was expensive and a lot of it were bones. \nThe beef rib steak was literally top-notch quality. I had absolutely no problem eating the fat cause the meat was that great. Something you put in your mouth, and you didn't have to chew. They don't try to fancy you in anyway with their cooking method, they want you to taste their quality of the meat. \nCauliflowers were also really good. Very meaty and the lemon went well w/ it.\n\nAs I said, I really recommend coming w/ a small party. I wasn't anywhere near full. Oh the thing that bugged me the most about this place was the wait for the pig and the steak. I think we waited an hour for it and that was the thing that bugged me about this place. \n\nExpect to pay a lot, it's definitely fine-dining.
420	0	a	Terrible WARNING please don't waste your money our steak was 250 bucks tiny full of fat and ice cold GROSS !!! I can't believe a new restaurant would be soo disgusting !! Our server was a nice guy and gave us a discount but still it was nasty !!! Never again !! Soo many better spots togo to in Vegas for steak  !
421	0	a	Hostess - I called to see if we could make reservations and they told us it was all booked for the rest of the night. When we walked by we asked for a table for 2 and a high chair then they told us to wait 15 minutes and that they didn't have any highchairs. First thing that's comes to mind is how could they NOT have high chairs!?! (Which they did have. She probably didn't know what a high chair for a baby was?) 20 minutes later we were finally seated. \n...The back of the restaurant has a bunch of empty tables. They were seating 6 top booths with only 2 people in it. The bigger booth had 4 people in it. For myself, my friend, and my baby they sat us in their smallest 2 top table. Ridiculous. These hostesses will definitely lose the restaurant a lot of customers and money if they don't learn how to do their job right\n\nServer Mija - Very nice, attentive, and welcoming. I asked her why they didn't have high chairs there and she assured me that they did so brought me one for my son. Thanks a ton! On top of that I asked her if they had any milk but they didn't so she went out of her way to go to The Griddle Cafe next door to get some for my son. Great Service!\n\nFOOD
422	0	a	Very disappointed. Shrimp and Pork Siu Mai had little flavor and no seasoning. The Superior Wonton Soup tasted more like water from Lake Superior. I ordered the soup recommended by the server but was then informed the soup was not available. I saw John Curtis a local food critic there eating  with Andy Wang, if they give this place a good review we know they were comped. I will stick with my favorites on Spring Mountain , which is a shame because I can walk here from my condo\n.
423	0	a	Come for: good service\nSkip: the food\n\nThe sauces and broth were bad but the noodles were good. Portions are extremely small. Don't be fooled by the size of the bowl, the amount of noodles inside barely covers the bottom and that's for an average of $17/bowl. You can also skip the shu mai even with gold on top, it tasted so bad. Service was nice but I wouldn't come back for sub sub par food.
424	0	a	"Ok, where to begin. First we were told by the hostess that there was not any way they could seat us because they somehow had the place booked out for reservations. Can't see how that could have been possible when there were only 2 or 3 tables with people seated. We had a party of 7 of us, and had to ask to speak to the manager since we were not sure how they could turn people away with so many empty tables. We were really excited to try this place out since we frequent so many noodle places in and outside of LV. Somehow the hostess came back and said they could seat us after all.\n\nWish we would have realized then that we would have been better off going anywhere else to eat but here. Once seated we ordered drinks and they came out looking good but tasted meh. Then ordered the Lucky 12 Shui Mai platter. That came with only a vinegar sauce. We had to ask for the chili sauce and soy sauce which the soy sauce never came and the chili sauce was more of a BBQ chili. The dumplings came out barely warm. The flavor of all the types that were included in the dim sum combo were all dry, terrible and not at all like any dim sum I have ever had before, and I have had a lot of dim sum all over in Asia. We also ordered the hot pot which was completely flavorless along with the won ton soup, I agree with the other yelper Lisa N. We ordered the La Mein which the noodles were way overcooked and had a bitter flavor to them. Just terrible. Then came the Watermelon salad with Cilantro and mint. This was so sugary it should have been more of a dessert item than salad. Not too many Asians I know like sweetness to this level in their food. \n\nWe told the server everything was awful and I asked him if he thought the food was good and he looked at us nervously and said that he felt the food was terrible as well.\n\nWait it gets better and worse from here....we asked to talk to the manager and he completely defended the food as if we were crazy to think it was bad which we soon realized why. Jose Andres the owner was sitting at a table not far from ours. \n\nMe being the ballsy kinda girl I am approached Jose Andres directly about the food. I let him know that the food was not good in fact terrible and many changes would need to happen if he wanted to get returning customers. He told me he thought it was wonderful and that I have bad taste. I told him what was going wrong with just the dim sum and he said he would pay for our meal. I said I was not trying to get a free meal just trying to offer him some \""REAL\"" feedback on how the food he was offering was from a customer's perspective. He told me not to come back and I said \""No problem.\"" Good luck to him. Even if he begged me to come try the food again free or even payed me I would not trust \""HIS' palette on anything Asian."
425	0	a	"The modern decor reminds me of some cafe in Hong Kong but bigger, and decorated with bags of rice.  Nothing special.  The menu is eye poppingly expensive for a casual noodle joint.  That's why I took a picture of it.  I ordered the lucky 12 which is their seu mai combination.  Of course they served me wonton soup instead.  I got my order in due course.  It was flavorful.  I liked the dim sum better than China poblano.  That's not saying much.  The dish cost $5 more than it should.  I could forgive that with stellar service and impeccable decor but alas, none was on offer.  The waitress has now asked me if I wanted my check twice.  Why would I change my mind after I said, \""yes\"" the first time?  I blame management who obviously did not train the staff well or hired the wrong people.  They seem to be more concerned with table side service than making sure there is a proper flow in service throughout the restaurant.  Don't worry about the show if you can't get the basics right."
426	0	a	Had pork/shrimp shu mai, crawling ant noodles, wonton soup, water, soda for $60. Shu mai had cute gold flakes on them but very greasy and falvorless. Noodles very good and clearly hand made which we appreciated but everything lacked flavor. \n\nI concede that maybe it was sooooo authentic that we didn't know what we were eating but 1.) I'm asian 2.) I've been to lots of dim sum places 3.) my mom made wonton soup for us growing up. \n\nService was good and attentive, though, which should have brought this to two stars until I got the bill. Just no way to justify the food quality for that price.
427	0	a	Should read review before going, felt have to come here to write review. Everything people comment is true. You are almost shocked by the vol for food and think that they must divided food in the kitchen for you. Can't understand how can you make a noodle at the price with that quality and quantity.
428	0	a	Two plates and a tiny appetizer $48.00 \nNow if it were worth it no problem BUT the wonton soup had no flavor, noodles were under cooked . The soup it's self wasn't filling , such a huge bowl for a tiny serving. Bring your own hot sauce since they don't have any. This place looks to be great but don't be fooled. Never ever coming back.
429	0	a	Went here for lunch yesterday.  Being Chinese I know what I'm talking about when it comes to quality and authenticity of Chinese food.  \nThe food was extremely expensive, small portions, and not tasty.  I ended up getting a pizza from 800 degrees a hour later because I was still hungry after spending $60 for sucky food.\nI will never go to this establishment again.
430	0	a	Terrible. They didn't write down our order right. Also took 45 minutes to get our food. I don't understand how they could expect to do well with this speed. I would never come here again. Found plastic in our food. Wtf? It's like eating Panda Express version of Chinese food but higher prices and not as good as Panda Express. \n\nAt least the manager Tony compt our entire meal...
431	0	a	The food wasn't bad. But the portions were out of wack for the price I could have gone to a better restaurant and be content with what I ate.
432	0	a	This is not Chinese food. If you must have Chinese food on the Strip, go to Jasmine or Noodles at the Bellagio, or Zine at the Palazzo, which have chefs that are experienced with Chinese cuisine. My noodle soup had Virginia ham added to it? The waitress asked if I would like sugar in my tea? Five stars for Bazaar Meat, thumbs up to The Griddle, but sorry, no to Ku Noodle. For an authentic, casual Asian dining experience in the hotel, how about a Din Tai Fung or Momofuku instead? I would line up for that. The experience I'm picturing for this location would be like 99 Noodles at the Wynn Macau.
433	0	a	Super excited about trying this awesome noodle place but ended up very disappointed. We were a party of 7 and tried the Dim Sum lucky 12 appetizer and wonton soup... awful! :( Way over priced and unimpressed with the food. Sad that a brand new casino you want so badly to be successful does so poorly with food quality.
434	0	a	BEWARE, IF YOU LIKE FOR YOUR FOOD TO TASTE GOOD, DO NOT EAT HERE. \n\nHoly bland food alert batman!!! Before i get started, I can say the only reason we went here is because the viewing window of the shumai chef made us interested and the fact that bazaar meats would accept a walk in. ANYWAY, server was sweet, but lacked basic menu and drink knowledge. The chefs CANNOT be tasting the food before they send it. The wonton soup literally tasted like water. It was horrible. Had the shumai (lucky-12) and they were simply flavorless. The bao bun tastes like a pork burger. Had two other noodle dishes and total was $106...
435	0	a	I would have to agree with one of the reviewers here when they said that the best thing about this restaurant is the service.  But I think that is all that was really good about this place.  The food was just okay.  Not worth the price, especially for a joint that's on the strip.  It lacked alot.  $8 for some siomai that I can get at any dim sum restaurant. 6 pieces and it was tiny and lacking.  I've had way better.  The serving sizes are very small and will hardly fill you up.  Thank goodness we had a food voucher, otherwise, I would be terribly pissed off that I spent $73 on a small rice dish that they claimed can feed 3-4 people but was hardly enough for 2.  All in all, I was highly disappointed and HUNGRY after leaving the place.  Never again.
436	0	a	I can't see this place staying open much longer. It was dead at lunch and for $60 plus tip was so not worth it. I had a greet tea margarita ($14) and it was small and forgettable. My friend had dan dan Mein noodles while I had the shrimp crispy noodles. The service was great however nothing else was. My shrimp dish tasted ok... Definitely not worth $25 but after I got home I was immediately sick and have been for 5 hours now. Save yourself and stay away from this place.
437	1	a	Came in to take my Bride for our simple night out on our 20th Wedding Anniversary!\nA Pleasant young man (ISIA) greeted us in the front and seated us in a very nice roomy booth. Then came our server (SERGIO) who is also Nice and Pleasant and helped us with the menu and made plenty of suggestions to make our picks really easy. We ordered the Wonton soup with egg noodles which is alright and the Highlight of our dinner which is the Hakka Rice! Oh man! That was some Beautiful Food! It's a must try dish! Everyone seems to be on top of their game! (Service that is!) A fine gentleman approach us (TONY) and checked and see how we are doing and Congratulated us on our Anniversary and gave us something Special which we really enjoyed! To all of You guys that I mentioned THANK YOU ALL for a Wonderful evening at KU Noodle. We Will Be Back!
438	0	a	Jose Andres, just because you're a chef (a great one) doesn't mean you can put your spin on anything.  I walked by at 11:30 and was thinking if I don't try it now I don't know when I'll be able to so might as well.  The menu is pretty limited, not like Noodles or Red8.  I asked the waiter what he recommended between a couple of noodles and he said la mein lo mein.  When it came out, I had two bites and all I tasted was immense salt, soy sauce and what seemed to be msg.  I told the waiter this was way too salty to eat and he was nice enough to take it off my bill.  I didn't want to be adventurous again and decided to order the wonton noodle soup thinking this can't be screwed up.  Guess what?  It was.  The wontons were so salty and had a terrible taste to it.  The noodles texture weren't great, it was softer than normal and again the bowl of noodles just felt like it had a lot of msg and salt in there.  The waiter asked how it was and I again gave the thumbs down.  They then sent the manager over who was kind enough to explain to me this is Jose Andres spin on Chinese food and it's not traditional Chinese cuisine.  Anyway please don't put any spins on Chinese food if you aren't going to do it well.  The manager ended up comping my meal which I thought was very nice.  I'm giving this place one star because the service was good and that's it.
439	0	a	"I'm not Chinese. I don't speak the language. But I'm pretty sure \""Ku\"" is Chinese for \""You gonna get screwed!\""\nWe sure did. The prices here are outrageous, a common theme in the reviews.\nThey could have saved a ton of money on the plates and bowls by purchasing smaller versions to match the small portions. I'm not quite sure what exactly the idea is from a marketing standpoint when restaurants use great big dishes for tiny portions. I can't eat the bowl. Add more stuff. It's not morels or truffles...it's f'n noodles! In the grand scheme of things in a restaurant they're free compared to things like meat, vegetables, seasonings, flavor. Did I mention the flavor? I had ants crawling on a stick, not literally, that was the name of the dish. No stick, no ants, no crawling unless you include me crawling to the toilet later in the day... This stuff was spicy but lacked flavor, extremely salty, left a taste in my mouth like a shoe and induced acid reflux which lasted at least three hours. I love Chinese food. I'm not even sure the guys in the kitchen were Chinese. They looked like they had been working at Burger King the week before.\nMy wife had the 'Superior Wonton Soup'...NOT! She kept on saying, these are box noodles, these are box noodles...except they don't taste as good. \n\nThen the bill came. Toxic shock, soft drink, iced tea and the two dishes, $50. Like I said, \""Screwed again!\"" \n\nFunny thing about the way Yelp is treating these reviews. Many of you have provided extremely detailed negative and I might add based on my personal experience, wholly justified comments. Yet Yelp has chosen to summarize only positive reviews at the top of the page of reviews. Any poor unsuspecting reader intent on deciding if Ku is worth a visit, could be mislead by this obviously misleading practice. They gonna get 'Kued!'"
440	0	a	Health hazard! Decor and extremely high price suggests high quality, handmade food.  It's not.\n\nTaste is awful. That's actually not my main complaint. Taste is suggestive after all.  Trying to be Din Tai Fung I think.\n\nPortions are miniscule.  $25 for three tiny shrimp.  Appetizers are bigger than this place's entrees.\n\nHowever, my main problem is the fact that they serve raw meat.  And it's not steak tartare.  It was a won ton noodle soup.  Won tons are supposed to be pork and shrimp.  No shrimp.  That would cost them too much.  This was corn starch, gravy, and some meat I think was pork.  Yes, it was awful.  Not the main problem.  Owner insulted me and we got into an argument about it.  He said I didn't understand what fusion food is.  Fine.  We'll agree to disagree.  It doesn't change the fact that the pork was RAW!  You can't serve raw pork!  You can pass intestinal worms that way.\n\nOur poor waiter was so embarrassed.  He even said that he doubted he would see us again but if he did, he hoped they would have improved.  The health department will probably shut them down first.
441	0	a	Their Sake Punch is really Good! But I ordered their Spicy Pork noodle dish (can't remember the name) and I did not like it, it was really thick and bland. There was very little meat and it was chopped so small it pretty much blended in with the noodles and sauce. \n\nMy friend ordered the Japanese Soba, which I liked (but it's a really simple dish to begin with). Along with a Banzai Bunny White Peach Sparkling Sake ($35 for 300ml )\n\nThere Chicken and Mushroom Dim Sum taste like Steam Dumpling and are really small in size, it was nothing special! \n\nSince the Soba was decent maybe I will try this place again but than again I highly doubt it. \n\nThe tab came out to $90

Sparsely decorated but brightly lit, with white porcelain and leather beset by mirrors on both sides, it was just after 5pm that I found myself seated at a table near the back of the space and soon greeted by the first of several servers I couldn't help but be impressed, each smiling face possessing both knowledge and opinions on the cuisine plus a whimsical professionalism far too infrequently seen in Casino dining these days.  Beginning first with dark tea liberally sweetened by coconut milk alongside a light salad, vibrant with mint playing off the sweetness of peeled orange segments, it would not be long before the table was flooded with heavier hitting flavors and presented as a four-part feast the only question was where to start - an answer soon found in the appropriately named \""Lucky 12\"" and its four triplets of innovative Siu Mai as each delicate wrapper was stuffed to bursting with poignant flavors set against accoutrements including tobiko, goji berry, and even gold leaf.  Not to be outdone by dim sum the next bites of Ku were of the signature noodles and although future visits will be required to sample other styles I have to say the texture of the thick wheatbelt variety speaks volumes, each tender bite teaming with spice in a broth rendered from lamb neck as pickled radish helped to temper the spice.  Having already heard good things about the bao and happy to confirm that the fist-sized umami-bomb on deep-fried bun is every bit as delicious as its ingredient profile would indicate it was finally in lowly congee that I indulged and although most will eschew such a pedestrian option in a place like this suffice it to say that this is not your mom n' pop rice porridge, the silky stock itself teaming with vibrant spices and all the better for bites imbued with egg, tender vegetables, peanuts, and a whole lot of funk-meets-sweet meat.  At this point quite sated but unable to resist dessert described as 'can't miss' by nearly everyone in the restaurant my final decision of the evening was which of the eight flavors of Taiwanese Shaved Ice to choose and eventually opting for Malted Milk with a trio of toppings plus one sauce I'll simply say that anyone who thinks Snowflake is 'amazing' needs to stop by The SLS ASAP, the $9 bowl more than enough for two to share with rich flavor amidst a stunning texture that you are actually encouraged to experience with chopsticks in order to focus on each snowy crystal...at least until you give into temptation and grab a spoon to fully indulge in a mouthful and never look back until scraping the bowl clean.\n\nUndoubtedly facing an uphill battle in a city where cheap meats and ramen shops speckle Spring Mountain Road, Ku Noodle presents an upscale option for those willing to invest in quality ingredients, innovation, and presentation.  Perhaps my favorite thinkfoodgroup experience to date, outside of 'e,' every single plate at Ku Noodle proves Chef Andres dedication to both quality and creativity while the staff is every bit as well trained, efficient, and pleasant as that at Bazaar - something you surely aren't going to find on Spring Mountain where service is often an afterthought, at best."
443	0	a	I really don't care for how small the portions are here but my god the taste was terrible.\n\nThe service here was ok. The waitress constantly checked on us and it was good enough for me to leave her a tip.\n\nThe food here was terrible. I had their Lucky 12 siu mai (an order of 4 different siu mai 3 each. One of them was at par it was edible. The others my god what were you thinking when you made these. Is this something you would eat for lunch and dinner? For my self after one bite I couldn't eat it any more.\n\nI also had an order of their crispy ocean noodle. Nothing special the sauce they added on to it just made it feel like its suppose to be like chow mein? but its crunchy? not memorable or appetizing at all.\n\n\nWhen the server asked me how the food was I let her know she told me that she would bring the manager over I told her not to but to just bring me the check. \n\nShe was nice enough to bring us dessert. \n\nShe brought us Thai shaved ice which was decent. My note to this was if you're going to us fruits please use fresh ones or at least try your own fruits before you serve it. They had blue berries and strawberries in the shaved ice and both were bitter.\n\nKu noodle has to really just change their menu out or reinvent themselves or they might fail.
444	0	a	This is the second visit to Ku noodle... I was very disappointed with the portion of the food... First time it was great but now it's like half of the portion... The food didn't taste the same. Service is great but the food isn't the same.... Good bye Ku-Noodle.
445	0	a	"We just moved to Las Vegas and wanted to check out the new SLS.  We decided to have lunch at Ku Noodle because of the bright, clean dining room and delicious-looking menu.  The service was amazing and the waitress did a good job of explaining the dishes to us.  We decided on the Shrimp & Pork Siu Mai (Very good!) and the Crispy Ocean Noodle dish.  The waitress said the noodle dish was a very large dish, enough for two people.  She must have been talking about the size of the plate rather than the portion, because it was far from a 2-person plate of food.  It was delicious, but there were only three shrimp and they had the heads on.  Some people may like this, but we were grossed out by it.  The waitress was very apologetic about it and said that she should have mentioned that the shrimp came with the heads on.  However, it really should be mentioned on the menu.  Another thing not mentioned on the menu is that there are no free refills on tea.  I had a small glass of iced tea for $4 and since the menu didn't state \""no refills\"", I asked for seconds assuming it would be free of charge.  I was not told that there would be another $4 charge for the additional tea, so I was very surprised to see the additional charge on our bill.\n\nThe food is good, but way overpriced.  The dining room has a casual vibe and the service is amazing, but with food prices this high, I expect a little more, like maybe not having servers in jeans and t-shirts.  This place really isn't worth the price and we won't go back.  For great noodles at a great price, we prefer Noodle Asia at The Venetian."
446	1	a	Overall, we enjoyed our meal at Ku. We ordered the Snow Pea Leaf Salad, which was light and refreshing. We also had the Lucky 12 Siu Mai (the pork & scallop and the shrimp & pork ones were the best). The Crispy Bao Bun was very tasty and different. For the main course, we ordered the Dan Dan Mian - these were alright, and the Hakka Fried Rice Pot (star of the show). We also had the bok choy with mushrooms - very tasty. It was a bit loud and the staff does not wear uniforms so it is hard to tell who  works there and who doesn't, but it was a fun atmosphere and a nice meal.
447	1	a	Decided to check out this place with friends during our stay at SLS. The food was delicious. The noodles are made from scratch and you can taste the quality. My favorites were the Crispy Bao Bun and the Hakka Fried Rice Pot. It's a great place to have a family style kind of meal. Our server Alex was helpful in food recommendations and just amazing overall. Would definitely recommend this place to anyone staying in Vegas.
448	1	a	Stayed here for a conference for the first time and my experience has been more than lackluster.  Until I came to Ku Noodle. My bartender, Lina, was amazing. Extremely friendly, helpful and eager to serve. She took an interest in my dining experience and ensured that I was pleased at all times. However, the GM Ceilidh was not as warm. Lina was serving me and the GM interrupted her to help her with a transaction.  Rather than lead by example, greet me and apologize for the interruption, she was cold and didn't even make eye contact with me. The SLS and SBE are world renowned and emphasize stellar service.  A simple hello and how's your meal would have sufficed. \n\nThe food was delicious.  Lina recommended a delicious beer and a very comforting vegetable and noodle soup. Not typical to find such yummy Asian soup on the strip, I'll definitely be back for another bowl. The 4 stars reflect Lina and the food, there would be been all 5th had the GM been remotely nice.
449	0	a	The service here is very slow. Our main dish came before our appetizer. And the food was mediocre and over priced. Will not recommend this place to anybody. But the manager was kind enough to wave our bill.
450	1	a	Some of our friends went here and said it wasn't all that, but I wanted Asian food and this was the only Asian restaurant in our hotel that was open at the time, so my friend and I decided to give it a try anyways. I actually enjoyed their food. Most of their lamb dishes are made with cumin, which definitely takes some getting used to, there's a pungent taste to it. Their noodles are handmade, the dough kneaded and and threaded individually into noodles, tasting very similar to udon noodles, just not as visually symmetrical. In my opinion, the food encompasses a traditional Taiwanese style of cooking. The food is lightly seasoned, the meat is tender and well cooked, and the vegetables fresh. The presentation of the food is simple, consistent with the cooking style. The restaurant set up is modern with Chinese writings on the mirrors that makes it look too busy and a little tacky. Word of caution, if you're not accustomed to more authentic Chinese food and are looking for more Americanized Chinese dishes, something safe, then this would not be the place to go, it's more of an acquired taste.
451	1	a	The ku Munk was rich n full of flavor. The broth was seasoned to perfection. But I don't know how they sleep at night charging $16.88 for a bowl of ramen n veggies. Just seems a lil outrageous.
452	1	a	Super Duper yummy. Every course that we had was very original. The fried wontons where crispy yet a little greasy. The lamb shu mai with the a taste that I have never had before and really enjoyed. For the main courses we ordered for different dishes. The seafood hot pot, lo mein, congee and short rib with noodles. Each one had bold flavors and an original taste. The best part of our meal with the shaved ice. We ordered the chocolate with brandied cherries, mochi, strawberries and caramel sauce. It was amazing. Being a person who does not eat dairy and having chocolate with an ice cream consistency that is so smooth and sweet yet dark chocolate intense is a true pleasure. It was huge and all four of us enjoyed every single bite. You could even get drunk of the brandied cherries.  I can't wait to go back again and try different dishes.
453	1	a	Arrived on a Monday evening. Tired from travelling and sales calls I opted to dine in at one of the many choices at SLS hotel.\n\nI was greeted immediately and I requested a table which the young hostess eagerly accommodated. My location was off the bar and was able to the enjoy Monday NFL game.\n\nThe restaurant is promoted and endorsed by Jose Andres so I was curious how it would weight in against the authentic eateries 10 minutes away in Chinatown. I started off the pork & scallop shu mai & Singha beer. The shu mai were on the small side but very tasty. I ordered the beef noodle soup but at this time my friendly waitress returned and advised me they had ran out which was a surprise to hear. I wanted hand pulled noodles so I chose the Ku monk noodle soup which contained egg, veggies, rice cracker and delish hand pulled noodles at $14.88. I saved room for dessert and the only item is the shaved ice. I requested toppings of sliced strawberries,  mochi, almond jello and strawberry syrup.  At $8.88 the serving was large, refreshingly delicious and served with chop sticks.\n\nOverall my experience at Ku Noodles was enjoyable - on the pricy side but convenient. I'll be returning to experience the beef noodle soup!
454	0	a	"One of the big (ok, probably the only) reasons to stay at the SLS in Vegas is that it's really cheap right now. While the hotel itself is cheap, the same can't be said for the food options and this restaurant is one of the worst offenders.\n\nI wanted to try all the various shao mai they offered, since I'm a big fan of fusion food done right. If you order their \""Lucky 12\"", you get 12 shao mai, for the incredibly stupid price of $20.88. With the exception of the 3 lamb shao mai, they all were completely bland and uninteresting. You can head to Din Tai Fung and get an order of 10 for $7-$8, and the worst thing I've ever heard anyone say about them is that they aren't as good as the XLB. We were off to a bad start.\n\nNext up for me was the \""Crispy Pork Bao Bun\"". This started off good. I waited a little bit for the bun to cool off, and bit in. Great texture on the bun. This immediate burst of flavor hit, and then I had the weirdest culinary experience of my life. I didn't even chew, didn't even swallow, and all of the taste just disappeared. From a chemistry standpoint, I don't even understand how it's possible for flavor molecules to just dissipate or disperse that quickly. This went from me thinking that this was a dish I could return just to eat, to me wondering if I had brain tumor or a stroke or something. I tried the next bite, and the next, and the next. It was like all the taste was there, hiding in the background, too shy to introduce itself anymore. That was $9.88. (everything on the menu ends in 88 cents, because Chinese.)\n\nMy friend ordered the \""Superior Wonton Soup\"" which features \""Superior Broth\"" as its primary component. First off, Soundwave is superior, and all others are inferior. More importantly, this is some of the blandest soup I've ever tasted in my life. If I roll over to A&J or literally any other Chinese place, the thin chicken broth that they give you to pour over your rice has 100 times more flavor than this did. My friend commented that the only way to get any taste besides \""water\"" out of the soup, he had to eat every spoonful with one of the wontons. This cost $15.88.\n\nEven in terms of Vegas pricing, this is one of the least flavorful, least satisfying, and least cost-effective meals I've ever eaten. I wouldn't have cared about the prices if this stuff actually just tasted good, but it was all just bland, bland, bland. Maybe part of it is due to the general funky smell that the SLS has right now, but since I couldn't just turn off the SLS odor, I have no way of knowing.\n\nI don't intend to come back to find out.\n\nService was ok, and my friend really liked his Sake Punch, which is why this gets more than one star. This place is only open for dinner, which was a source of consternation. Why would you specialize in Dim Sum and NOT be open for breakfast or even late?"
455	0	a	If the name of the dish sounds good it really doesn't mean the food will be or the server.  The prices were not matched to the quality of the food either. If you think paying twenty five dollars for a plate with bait shrimp thrown on top of cold lousy noodles then eat at Ku Noodle.  Hey does this place really know what dim sum is?  I wouldn't consider four shu mai's a definition of that.  The d\u00e9cor is really a bunch of five pound rice bags.  I still can't get the server's giant snapping teeth and attitude out of my mind.
456	0	a	Even though I am impressed with the design of the restaurant, I was disappointed in this Asian eatery. This place is only open from 5pm to 11pm. Who eats dim sum for dinner? It doesn't make sense. \n\nA casual looking guy comes and takes my order. He looked like a regular paying customer. I ordered the Northern Beef Stew based on his recommendation as a good noodle soup. Don't get me wrong, my dish was pretty good, but the service was terrible. My drink was not brought to me even after my dish was brought to my table. I had to ask for it again.\n\nOne of the most important thing that accompanies a noodle soup, is of course a soup spoon. I think it is sad that this was forgotten and I had to ask for that too. On top of that, it was almost $20 for the noodle soup before taxes. It is not worth $20 bucks, especially with the terrible service. In addition, portable chopsticks? I expect real chopsticks.\n\nAfterwards, it was difficult to flag my original waiter down since he was too preoccupied with other customers so I had the hostess bring me the check. I really wanted to like this place, but the lack of service made me quite disinterested.
457	0	a	pork & shrimp shumai was yummy. Beijing tomato noodle was way too dry and the other one we got ,which picture was shown on the menu, I was not sure what I was supposed to taste of. Lack of flavor. We waited for 30 mins after the server took our order. If the food was good, I wouldn't care. Overall, I am so disappointed at SLS. One in Beverly hills is SO MUCH BETTER.
458	0	a	The waiting time is fucking long. The noodle is such a small bite. Never try this... Trust me..
459	0	a	Average flavour with little selection.  Minimal seafood, which was not not the situation when I was in Barcelona at tapas restaurants.  Generally over priced given the market, 18$ for 6 shrimp and 4$ for 3 1x3 pieces of bread.
460	1	a	Lots of good food. Croquettes were amazing.  Service was good.
461	0	a	Pass by this one. Worst experience of our trip to beautiful Montreal. Incompetent staff, mediocre food, high prices. It looks very inviting from the street with a lively crowd (not sure why they're there) and lovely decor, but we waited endlessly once seated and ended up getting food before any drinks. We ordered a margarita and were delivered some sort of martini, and the waiter was quite miffed that we were sending it back. We asked for recommendations for wine by the glass and after a long struggle to extract some information, were delivered something quite weak and thin, instead of the bold red we were looking for. The waiter actually started arguing with us. In a city with such amazing restaurant choices, this one should not be on anyone's list.
462	0	a	Before you read my review, you should know that when I went to Barcelona, this was my favorite restaurant... So my expectations were high and I was highly disappointed. \n\nFood is just not good. There are no other words. I tried more than half the menu... nothing was good. Even the patatas bravas, which could have been good, were a complete salt bomb... and I like salty. We were 3 and we were unable to finish that plate. \n\nEvery dish was one noted. Nothing special. \n\nThe paella was also a disappointment. The saffron tasted off to say the least... maybe it was burnt or a kind that I don't know. \n\nThis is much more a bar than it is a restaurant.\n\nI must say our waitress was very nice. So nothing bad to say about the service.\n\nBasically, I am very sad that I didn't like it... I really wanted to love it.
463	0	a	I live a couple blocks from this place and decided to take my wife for our 5th wedding anniversary, so made a reservation for a thursday 2 weeks in advance. When we arrived they gave us the one table that is not really part of the dining room, but rather in the corner right next to the door to the kitchen that the staff keeps walking through. I politely asked the hostess for a different table (even playing the wedding anniversary card, and explaining I had reserved well it advance). Instead of finding me another table, or asking us if we didn't mind waiting until another table would free up, she just flat out refused without even looking around the room; so we just left and went elsewhere.
464	0	a	Nothing like the food at Tapas 24 in Barcelona.\n\nWe were at tapas 24 yesterday for Barcelona chef Carles Abellan.\n\nService: Very poor. No water. The sommelier removed our glass of wine when empty without even offering another glass or bottle...\n(We had planned for another bottle but when we were able to talk to someone, we were done eating)\nSeems like the staff was inexperienced.\nEntire service was rushed as if they wanted us out for a specific time.(2nd service)\n\nFood: ok but expensive for what we had. Nothing fabulous. Paella extremely salty\n\nAtmosphere: good! Nice restaurant.
465	1	a	So I'd say 4.5 is more accurate, but overall great food, great atmosphere, and great service\n\nI saw the negative reviews, so was reluctant to try it. Keep in mind I've never been to Barcelona location. After arriving, to my surprise it was packed. Very trendy and hip kind of place. Kind of reminds me of a LA or Manhattan kind of vibe\n\nI came for the MAT special, and crazy amounts of food for the price. It's really more like for 2 than for 1.\n\nBest dish was the cod with the croquettes a close 2nd\n\nIf your used to tapas, the size may be bigger than your expecting
466	0	a	Where does one begin with this place? It's almost as though they went out of their way to screw up as much as possible. These people are not only incompetent but apathetic too which just adds insult to injury.\n\nThe service was a fiasco. The food was an absolute let down compared to any tapas you'd get in Barcelona. The portions tiny and the prices audacious considering the almost comical nature of the lack of service and attention. \n\nAfter several mistakes, delayed and haphazard delivery of dishes, wine poured into a glass that was already half full of a different wine etc. management made no effort to offer any kind of concession or even express the slightest concern for our dissatisfaction. We were a very undemanding and reasonable group of people who were just pushed to the brink after a series of disappointments.\n\nThis place sells image and pretense- they don't know tapas and they're not particularly concerned with what you think either. They are banking on the herd mentality and hoping you're too distracted with your date to notice the level of indifference and disorganization. \n\nAll that money in decor and location while negating the most crucial aspects of running a successful restaurant won't be enough to salvage Abellan's name. If they stay open be sure it is not a testament to the quality of the restaurant but to the undiscriminating and inexperienced clientele. Shame on management. Get rid of the pretentious children who don't know the first thing about dealing with customers and put some professionals in there.
467	1	a	Great place for good food n great music. \nDimly lit nice atmosphere , the staff are very friendly and courteous to tourists , even help us to Ina a place to hang out after we ate ... Great food, good service and fantastic music !!!!!
468	0	a	Casual atmosphere and quick seating.  Server was very mediocre in attitude and suggestions.  The night took a turn for the worst when I discovered a piece of plastic wrap inside my bacon wrapped meatloaf.  Will not be back!
469	1	a	We selected this restaurant based on Hoang-Khai's very positive Yelp review and I'm so glad that we happened on this lovely family-owned restaurant in the western reaches of the Plateau. We dined there on a lively Friday night with a group of six and we all enjoyed the evening very much. \n\nWhen I lived in Montreal I didn't have kids and didn't give a thought to whether an establishment would be kid-friendly or not but now it's very much on my mind and to my delight, T&T is very kid-friendly while at the same time hospitable to adults and student-types alike. The back area is spacious and simple with long tables and bench-like seating around the exterior. \n\nThe menu is straightforward and simple - tortas (Mexican sandwiches), tacos, and churros. I like the simplicity but I would say that a few appetizers would be a welcome addition. We were a group catching up after a long time of not seeing each other and we wanted our meal to last longer than just one course. I would have liked to start with some house-made chips and salsa and drinks or sopes or something. As it was we ordered three tortas to share - the vegetarian, milanesa (breaded beef filet), and pulled pork. The two meat tortas were quite delectable - the bread was soft and sopped up garlicky sauces quite nicely. I would say that the pepper in the vegetable torta would taste great if roasted - I think it would make the sandwich easier to eat. \n\nOn to the tacos - there are four tacos in each order so I definitely recommend pairing up and sharing. We had the fish, carnitas (pork belly to me was a little dry here), and the al pastor, which I loved. The salty-sweet with the addition of the pineapple is so nice. \n\nDrinks for me were the very refreshing Paloma (I loved the addition of Aperol in this drink) and the Chelada - a bloody Caesar with Corona. Mojitos, limonada, and some other items were also available along with beer, so there is definitely a nice variation of items. \n\nChurros for dessert are a must - we tried the dulce de leche and the chocolate and they were both incredible. Hot out of the fryer and drizzled with sweetness. The bamboo boards and salsa service is quite lovely too. \n\nBig plus: house-made tortillas! Amazing! \n\nThis is a great discovery and I can't wait to return!
470	1	a	super good and fresh and fairly priced-wonderful!
471	0	a	Overhyped and Overpriced.\n\nThe first time I ate here, I was *blown away* by the food (the service was okay). The last time I ate here, the food and service were so bad that I'll *never* go back.\n\nWe ordered two kinds of tacos, the pastors and the carnitas. The meat in both of them was *extremely* dry and none of the other ingredients were fresh. I suspect that they served us leftover meat from the day before. Neither of us finished our tacos. \n\nWe did *not* complain, but when our waitress asked how everything was, I explained that nothing was fresh. After speaking with the chef, she came back and explained that he said everything was fresh, so it must've been fresh.\n\nSubsequently, they offered us some complimentary churros. These too were too dry to finish.\n\nOn our way out, all three members of the kitchen staff gave us dirty looks.\n\nWhen spending $50 on tacos, I expect a lot more out of the food and service.
472	1	a	This place is everything that Mais should be. Excellent well priced food, super fresh, super yummy, strong drinks, and very reasonable prices. About $2-3 for a taco (they come in fours), and about $9 for a super strong, well made drink. Lovely relaxed sitting, great around sunset.\n\nSo why the Mais comparison? Well it's exactly the same idea almost, but here, the service is friendly and uplifting, with people that actually care.\n\nRead: when you walk in to T&T, the staff greet you, are smiling, and really nice. They take the time to spend 30 seconds just to make sure everyone has menus and understands the food, followed by another 30 seconds 5min later of friendly attention/suggestions, to make sure that our initial order is off to a great start. That 1min - whilst pathetically obvious on paper - is rare, and is a game changer. (Read my Mais review).\n\nAnyway, I will totally return here anytime in the area. Fav taco place in MTL. Loved it. Simple idea, done well.
473	0	a	Was excited to try this place out as I'm always on the hunt for tasty tacos. Unfortunately, there is a lot of work to be done here before this joint warrants a higher rating. To start, it is suffering from what I call hipster inflation. Reputation does not match reality. I ate the carnitas, four average sized tacos with some unfortunate dried out pork and no complex flavour to take away from the dryness. This dish was majorly lacking, and for $12, was a ripoff. I also had a spiked lemonade cocktail which was good, not the strongest I've had, but also not too weak: run of the mill I would say. For $9 bucks, I probably wouldn't order it again since I would need 4-5 of them to get a buzz (but I'm no lightweight so don't necessarily take my word on it!). My companion had a winner, the fish tacos. They were fried in panko crust and had some cabbage. The two sauces, one red and one green, were just ok, not memorable. Basically, if I had to go back, I would stick to the fish tacos but for the portion and price point ($13), I can find better. Impactaco is much cheaper, and even though that location is a bit sketch, their carnitas is to die for and $1 on certain days!!!
474	0	a	I really, really liked this place. Great tacos, amazing prices, nice staff. I went 3 times and loved it!\n\nUNTIL...\n\nI was waiting at the bar and saw that they recycle the salsa. Meaning, they put 3 pots of salsa on your table for your tacos. When you're done eating (and dipping your fork into these the pots), the salsa bowls go back to the ledge between seating and kitchen, they top up the bowls and re-serve to other tables. Meaning, you are served the same salsa that other people were dipping into. \n\nI witnessed this happening consistently for 30 minutes, I would not make these allegations unless I was certain. That just turns my stomach! Isn't this against health codes??? I can't go back knowing what I know. \n\nIf they stop recycling their salsa (which was yummy salsa), I'll be back in a second AND I'll delete this review. I'll write a 4-5 start rating instead, because that's what the place deserves. Deal?
475	1	a	This place is really different in a refreshing kind of way! You get to reminisce and eat a delicious burger!
476	1	a	J'ai tr\u00e8s bien mang\u00e9! Les burgers sont vraiment solides. La s\u00e9lection de cocktails est g\u00e9niale, beaucoup de choix pour les bi\u00e8res en f\u00fbt et les liqueurs. Le service \u00e9tait correct, rien d'assez d\u00e9rangeant pour se plaindre. Les prix sont pas mal non plus, bref c'est une place de 5 @ 7 assez chouette. Ma seule remarque n\u00e9gative serait le niveau de bruit un peu \u00e9lev\u00e9 \u00e0 mon go\u00fbt.
477	1	a	Came in on a rainy Saturday afternoon when it wasn't too busy. Great cocktail selection and atmosphere. Try the chili mango drink if you like your rum with a little extra kick - just spicy enough to tingle, but not overbearing. Unfortunately there was no chance to try the food.
478	0	a	Je deconseille vraiment. C'est la 1\u00e8re et derni\u00e8re fois..\n\nC'etait une exp\u00e9rience tr\u00e8s d\u00e9sagr\u00e9able. Une heure d'attente pour un mys\u00e9rable burger. Avoir de l'eau ou de la moyo prenait une demi heure.\n\nIl n'ya m\u00eame pas autant de monde.
479	0	a	"I really wanted to love this place, unfortunately, all around it fell quite short.  Their menu is pretty extensive with numerous choices, maybe I just chose the wrong item?  I ordered the Mac Buffalo Chicken.  I don't think I've ever had a more bland tasting meal in Montreal.  There was no spicey \""buffalo\"" to it at all and the chicken \""cubes\"" were tasteless for the most part.  My friend ordered the Mac Beef Baked Potato and she seemed to enjoy it more than I did mine.  I tried hers and also found that it was rather tasteless.\n\nThe staff was not all that great as well, our server took forever to bring a refill and it wasn't very busy.  The bartenders seem to keep the folks at the bar entertained with their \""flare\"" style of bartending, tossing of flaming bottles.  Overall, with prices being relatively reasonable I may go back once more in hopes of it being better."
480	0	a	"I had good hopes for this restaurant, but in the end everything fell flat.\n\nFirst off the drinks. I noticed they had mason jar cocktails, and being a fan of the Distillerie that immediately got me interested. If that's your thing too, don't get your hopes up. The two jars I got to taste (mine and my wife's) were both far, far behind Distillerie' in terms of quality and taste. All of the choices seemed very much on the sweet side, which is not too much my thing, do I decided to play it safe and order a Mojito. First big disappointment. Mojitos are always a hit with me, except this wasn't a mojito at all: they served me rum and lemonade with a twig of mint stuck in it at the end just for the look (the mint needs to be crushed first otherwise it won't give any flavour at all).\n\nWhen the waiter came to ask about the drinks I thought I'd mention it in case it was a mistake. Second big disappointment. I barely had the chance to start talking that he was already running away. I was able to stop him and explain, and his answer was that they couldn't crush the mint because of all the ice in the jar. 8-/\n\nFood was the third big disappointment. I got the Mad Greek, because I felt like something fresh and had great Greek themed burgers in the past. This wasn't one of them. First I find burgers are to thick, so good luck eating it with your hands without making a mess. It didn't help that the Greek toppings were too juicy and completely falling off the burger. Now that would be fine with me, except that the burger was also tasteless. I had a poutine on the side, and was also turned off by the sauce.\n\nNow in this whole time we saw our waiter 3 times in total, including taking the drinks then food orders. He hadn't brought any water until we were half way through the meal, didn't ask about the food, and took over twenty minutes to notice we were done with our plates. Mind you in the meantime the restaurant was getting more and more empty. I even had to chase him to get the bill.\n\nNow at this point I was fairly disappointed with the experience, and might have given it a 2 or 3 stars. But then came the killer. I decided to leave a 7% tip, which I thought was generous considering the 2.5 minutes the waiter spent at our table, the rushed attitude and the few words. First thing he does one I pay is look at how tip I left, right in front of me. HUGE mistake in my book, something I NEVER did in my years of working as a waiter. But I play along. He asks if I know tip isn't included (duh, I just left you 7%). I say yes, then following his confused look I ask him if he's wondering why is only 7%, which he was of course. When I tell him I was disappointed with both the food and service, his answer was \""Well don't come back, okay?\"" with the kind of superior attitude any respectable waiter I know would never dream of having.\n\nWell guess what, I was definitely not planning on going back, now I regret leaving any tip at all."
481	1	a	"I'm not a big \""let's eat at a restaurant\"" type a person but I'll go in a group setting for special events or just take out. Went on a Friday night & it was a packed house. Good thing our planner made reservations. The music in the place is at full blast so yelling is a must if you want to speak to the person next to you. The look of the place was kind of like a sports bar with several TVs situated around the place. The back of the bar decorated with a wall of booze which perked me up right away. A little tight on space but most restaurants are like that anyways. Good mix of guys & gals in the crowd for people watching.\n                  Pretty big menu of heart stopping goodness mainly featuring burger, poutine, fries & mac & cheese combos. Not too vege-friendly although they do have a couple of options. Lots of drinks to be had with beer (bottle or tap), hard liquor, mix drinks & wines. The menu is pretty pricey so if your looking for cheap eats, this place is not for you.\n                  Service was pretty good took a while to get our food but the place was busy that night & our party took a long while to order as we waited for everyone to arrive. Would go again just to try out that \""Epic\"" burger which almost costs $50 & see if I can wrap part of my mouth on it. \n                  Plus side, located at the Faubourg which is great to see some interesting businesses move in there since it's been in a state of decline for about two decades."
482	1	a	Amazingly good food, amazing staff. Drink menu is nothing you've seen before. Love the John Lemon mason jar! Owner came over to introduce himself, and made a feel very welcome. Great decor, atmosphere and music. Glad we stopped in! Will be back for sure when were back in the area. Thanks for having us!
483	0	a	I would avoid renting from this company. They never gave me required 30 day notice of rent increase. They also never return phone calls or emails. Claudia De La Rocha is rude and unprofessional. They also have been charging me late fees when I already paid my rent. They are a hassle and you will save time, money, and stress avoiding them.
484	0	a	I had a terrible experience with this company.  My brother and I rented a home in Peoria, AZ around March 2013.  It was the first time either of us had rented a house; we had previously lived in apartments.  A realtor showed us the property and we felt it meet our needs so we filled out an application.  They charged us an expensive application fee and explained they require a month's rent up front for a deposit as well as a non-refundable cleaning deposit of $275.  We paid the fees and scheduled a move in date.  The first weekend we moved in we noticed the washer and drier were missing.  We found out they were missing when the city came to turn on the water.  We had all of your belongings in the garage and when the city came to turn on the water, water sprayed over everything.  All of our boxes, furniture, and clothing were soaked.  I was very upset by this because the water permanently damaged some sentimental pictures.  I called the company and I was treated very rudely.  The property manager, who was very difficult to get a hold of, denied that a washer and drier would be provided and partially blamed us for leaving our belongings in the garage.  I pulled out the lease, highlighted the clause of the included appliances, and emailed this back to her.  She responded by acknowledging the clause and a washer and drier were installed a week later.  We never received an apology for our damaged items, something I am still bitter about today.  I understand crap happens, but I felt like I was treated very poorly without any sympathy for a situation that resulted from the company's negligence.  \n\nAs the months went along everything was fine.  My brother and I are great renters and require very little attention.  We paid our rent on time every month and lived our lives.  We received absolutely no contact from the company or property managers except by random letter letting us know that our property managers have changed.  Our property manager changed three times in the year we lived there.  About two months before our lease was set to expire we received a letter in the mail giving us our options.  We could either renew with a 10% rent increase or move out.  We never received any phone call or anything.  I was offended by this because we were in my opinion perfect renters.  We paid the rent on time every month and had no issues.  Then they just increase the rent 10% without even a phone call.  My brother and I decided to not renew the lease and emailed our intent to vacate to the email address on the letter.  A few weeks went by with no response.  I finally called the phone number on the letter and was directed to a call center woman.  She told me they never saw the email, so I resent the letter to the same email and she noted our account.  I asked a few questions about the move out process and the move out inspection.  A few weeks later I was contacted by their service supervisor to schedule the move out.  Of course none of the times he could meet would work for me, but I felt like we were leaving in the house in great shape so I wasn't worried.  I told him to do the inspection without me.  We moved out, cleaned up the house, and dropped off the keys at their Peoria office.  I heard nothing for three weeks.   I needed the money from the deposit so I called them up and was redirected numerous times to unhelpful, un-knowledge call center staff.  Finally after a few days of calling I was able to get ahold of someone in the office that knew what was going on.  She said that there was damages to the property and sent me an itemized move out statement.  They charged us to repaint the house, for a burn on the counter, and cleaning.  The total was over $700.00.  I was furious.  I called them up and demanded they explain what they charged us for and to explain to us what the hell the non-refundable cleaning deposit of $275 covered.  Out of all the places I have rented, I have never had any take my deposit.  \n\nShe sent me an estimate from a contractor and some pictures of walls.  We lived in that house for over a year! Of course there will be some minor wear and tear.  I put together a small claims suit and had planned on suing them in court, but I didn't know who to file the suit against.  The property was owned by one entity, the property manger was another, and rent was sent to another.  I couldn't get ahold of anyone.  After I calmed down, my brother and I decided to forgot about it and move on.   \n\nThis company fails on numerous levels.  They offer horrendous customer service, shady business practices, and it is extremely difficult to get ahold of anyone.  I would think twice before renting with American Colony Homes.

Can't wait for the robotic & generic message from Colony American Homes to appear under my posting... what a joke**

487	1	a	This place is right by my condo , so I decided to try it out , as I was craving some Mexican and Rita's for dinner! I was greeted promptly by hostess , but as a single diner , I had the feeling she was trying to get me to sit in the bar area , I opted for a restaurant seat , and felt a little bad , cuz they had to basically take out the other 3 settings , cuz I knew I was going to be eating good !! Lol , I was greeted promptly and courteously by my server , I started with the queso fundido with chorizo , which was oily ( expected ) but  was too salty for my taste, it did come out nice and bubbly , but couldn't take too much of the saltiness , for dinner I ordered the chile rellano , with rice and beans ( they do have  many other sides available ) the rellano was one one the best I've had in awhile very flavorful , not to spicy and oozing with cheese , not overly breaded or too heavy either !! I had a side of carnitas for 4$ ( good deal ) but basically took those home , they were pretty good and on the leaner side , I like my carnitas with a little balance of crispy fattiness , lol I'm glad I didn't get them for my entree , as I would have been disappointed . I did order a margapolitan?? Which was a nice variation of a margarita and Cosmo with both tequila and vodka !! It was served in a salted pint glass and highly recommended , I took home the chips, carnitas and the rest of the fundido ( as well as rice and beans ) to save room for dessert which was amazing , cheesecake flautas , crispy on outside with a sweet cheesecake filling drizzled with cinnamon sugar and chocolate !! Heaven !! I did eat that all up !! Drinks are a little on the pricey side and service was a bit rushed , I was in and out in about 45 mins with all 3 courses , entree came out while I was still on appetizer , but that is something I hope will be fixed as they learn their flow , I was one of only 4 tables at the time ! All in all I did enjoy my meal ! And probably will be back when the mood for sit down Mexican comes back ! Server did say that they soon will have a Sunday brunch and they do have happy hour specials ( think 3 to 6 or 7 ? ) would be a five star review , but the salty fundido and chips ( forgot to mention that ) and rushed service did take it down a bit !! Server was very friendly and attentive , just the timing was bad !!
488	0	a	What a disappointment!  Walked in and the decor is nice and place  was clean.  Figured we would try the table side guacamole since people were saying it was good.  It's ok, but nothing special besides the fact that it's made table side.  Ordered the carnitas con chile verde. Carnitas were far from a delicious dish. Just because you throw salsa  on some meat, warm it up and lather the meat with it does not mean you know what your doing .   Tried the enchiladas and it's hard to screw those up.  So they were ok.  Rice was good and beans not to shabby.  tortillas were not good, not that they have to be home made , but at least heat them up correctly.  Defiantly needs help with at least these two dishes. I would like to say I might give it another chance , but as of now I don't think I would go back.  The chips were at least good and served warm.  The red sauce served with chips was basically bad tomato puree or ketchup. The green salsa however was the only thing out of everything that was delicious.   Not only is this as of now in my opinion and from what I tasted far from authentic it is in need of a lot of help.  If you want a good meal this is not the place. If you want chips and amazing avocado salsa with your chips then come here !
489	0	a	"Wow , I have never had to update a review , but WOW !! This place had its problems before , but it's completely not worth the visit !! The girl behind bar ( Jill , I think they called her ) was probably the worst  server/bartender ever !! I sat down and had to wait for her to notice me , as there were only 6 people at the bar , you would think it wouldn't be hard , but ??? When she finally noticed me , I asked for a menu , and she gave me a bar menu , I asked for a full dinner menu , and ordered the chicken quesadilla (a couple bucks cheaper) from bar menu and carnitas tacos from reg menu at this point , I was ready to order a drink but she disappeared ( not even water ) when she came back I had to repeat my order and said \""quesidilla first \"" she then repeated my order back to me wrong !! So I had to correct Her again ! She then went off again and still no drink ! I got chips and salsa , with 2 salsas , then she finally came back and asked if I wanted anything to drink , I ordered a drink that I had ordered previously , the cosmorita but she said they don't have the ingredients to make it. ??? Wtf ??? So I ordered a reg margarita , eh!! That came out about the same time as my food, which appetizer and entree were together !! And with no silverware !! The food runner noticed and luckily brought me some ! At this point a skinney Hispanic guy and stocky women came into bar , and I'm assuming they were managers , but neither noticed or bothered to ask how things were , and they were in the seat next to me!! The quesidillas had bones in it !! Luckily on last bite ! And by the time I got to tacos they were cold and flavorless , about 50% salsa the rest tortilla and then meat in that order !! I gave up on eating and moved everything off to the side ! At this point still no one came to ask how anything was !! Another guy walked in bar and sat next to me , after about 5 to 10 mins the skinney Hispanic man , asked him if he had been helped and he politely said no and ordered a drink , he was served by the Hispanic man , and about 5 min later the bartender asked if he needed anything !! She then noticed that my plates were stacked and asked if she could take them ! There was no \"" was everything ok ?\"" Nothing ! Not even an offer for another drink which was sitting empty !! Eventually the Hispanic man came back and asked if I needed anything else , I just asked for check and he yelled out to bartender to get it for me! Which took another few minutes because she didn't have a pen , they had to ask the guy next to me for the pen back !! Finally got the check and paid & got my change from a 100$ bill plus 65 cents in nickels !! Btw some people at bar got 2 salsas others 3 ?? All in all I would never be back !! If I wanted bad margaritas , overpriced so-so food ( which I was charged full price for quesidilla and not the bar price ) there are many other choices to be had !! And as I quote one of the servers who was one of the 6 at bar when asked by another patron who was sitting at a bar table if this was his restaurant \"" he said heck no , if I open a restaurant , it's going to be an Italian one !! Hmm maybe it that's what will open at this location next !! It's kinda sad , but this restaurant had promise when it first opened and went straight down !!!"
490	1	a	These guys know their stuff! Super friendly and willing to help. They will teach you how to rebuild atty's or just get you started if you are new to vaping. They are the only store in the valley that has Walking Dead juice-which is amazing. They also carry like 20 Puff juice flavors. Always have great deals on mods and batteries. All in all my favorite vape shop around. Seriously need to check it out!
491	1	a	I love this place. I am not very knowledgeable with vaping, but these guys will always go the extra mile to make sure you're getting the best deal. I've come in multiple times with questions and they've always been super helpful. I cannot say enough good things about Fine Vapors.
492	1	a	Based in what was the Dabi diner underneath the pear tree and blind poet is a brand new pub. We popped in on the off chance to try somewhere new and were very impressed. \n\nThe decor is really nice and modern. They have padded picnic bench type seats and lots of nice interesting features dotted around. There is nod to the name of the place on thye walls, whcih seems to come from the Ushers brewery that existed over in the pleasance I am told. \n\nWe popped in for a quick pint obn Saturday and were so impressed by the menu had to come back to sample the breaakfast the following day. The portions are massive and everything is of high quality that we sampled. The veggie breakfast had the best veggie sausages ever I am reliably told. The meaty breakfas was ideal... just look at the pictures all server in griddle pans. :D\n\nThe staff are great, attentive and super frindly in a guiene way. Lots of knowledge behind that bar, which ius apt considering they have a great selection of beers on tap. I think they had 10+ on when I was but not 100%.\n\nGet youirselves in there, it is exactly what the area needed a really good modern pub with food to match. Thumbs up from me.
493	1	a	I have officially learned my lesson the hard way.  Geoff and Brittany are in the business of being honest and fair, which is RARE in a mechanic.  Like a moron, I took my car somewhere else for a new rack and pinion only to get screwed majorly and live to regret not just taking it to Geoff.  Every time I have taken my car to them, they've worked very hard to not only find the problem but let you know of other problems.  Their communication and customer service are top notch.  If you know of one problem but this one problem causes three other problems, they will call you and tell you about it to see what you want to do.  The work is superior to any mechanic I have found and they really stand behind it.  Every time I leave their shop, I feel like I'm driving a brand new car.  After this experience of trying to take it elsewhere, it is a lesson learned: All car repairs need to go through Geoff first.  \n\nNote: The shop is a little hard to find and Google Maps will lead you in a weird direction.  It's on the right side of Contractor's Road.  But it's worth the hassle to get there.  Geoff and Brittany are truly looking to keep customers safe on the road, rather than making a fast buck.
494	1	a	Geoff Spencer is the BEST, he is very detail oriented and knows what he is doing.  Both Geoff and Brittany are very serious about CUSTOMER SATISFACTION, they would go out of their way to accommodate you and your mechanical needs.  They LOVE what they do and it shows in their work.  You have nothing to fear when you take your vehicle to them, you can rest assure - you will have the problem diagnosed and fixed the FIRST time.  We highly recommend Geoff and Brittany.  They are the BEST in the BUSINESS.  Their prices are fair and AWESOME CUSTOMER SERVICE.  TOP NOTCH, THE CREME DE LA CREME, LOOK NO FURTHER, GIVE GEOFF A CALL TODAY!
495	1	a	I have personally used Spencer Auto Repair twice for my truck now.  The replaced my oil pan that was leaking (was warped from age) and again to replace my timing cover.  Both experiences were awesome.  They were friendly, professional and more than fair on pricing.  As a do-it-yourselfer mechanic since I was 15 I know when prices are just wrong.  That's never the case with Spencers Auto Repair.  Great family and great business!
496	1	a	Pizza was amazing!! I felt like I was back in Brooklyn ..... Cannoli was best I had out in Vegas and I have eaten at great restaurants... Parking is tough but worth it!!
497	0	a	Thumbs down to this place. With great anticipation we ordered a cheese. & sausage pizza to take out. When we got home it was cheese & pepperoni. The sauce was bitter and just because the place has New York in it`s name, doesn't mean it is good. Sweeten the sauce and listen to what the customer orders.
498	0	a	I'm not sure how everything could be this wrong and this cold, but it is.  I ordered MILD wings, easy sauce, and got MEDIUM wings (written on the cover) dripping in sauce.  I ordered a half meatball/half ham pizza, the pizza is covered in both toppings.  Why offer half and half pizza if you don't know what it means?  And, considering they're less than 2 miles from my place, my food should not have been stone cold.  First and last time ordering from this place.
499	1	a	Great real Italian New York style pizza definitely is the best pizza in Las Vegas. I love the food and the deserts are out of this world.  The chef Luigi, Leonardo make the best Italian food in town.
500	0	a	Ordered once and not impressed. What really turned me off was when I saw their employees drinking at 1:00 in the afternoon at a local bar just down the street in uniform. I'm not making accusations as they may have been off work, but believe that it's a horrible way to represent your company. Just think it's not very professional
501	0	a	Sad to say they had great pizza at the beginning .. Now cutting corners ... Very pricey not worth the money.. We will not be ordering there anymore. It's a shame because we didn't mind the high price for good pizza. But dominos pizza is close and way better and cheaper !!!
502	1	a	I am glad this place opened up because there are not that many independent pizza shops that deliver on this side of town.  I have ordered twice and the quality of the pizza improved on the second time.  I also love caprese salads, and they have a pretty good one.
503	0	a	Definitely not New York pizza but it does have the cool New York look made me feel like back home
504	1	a	My new favorite restaurant.  They have 22 different fish dishes ranging from $16-23, at least a dozen different kinds of pizza slices ready for you to pick out of the case, soups, salads, and 15 kinds of pasta that they will serve with any of 4-6 different sauces.  The food is so yummy!  I rate it 5 stars because the menu is huge, it fits a niche market that is in need of more restaurants, the people are warm and friendly, food is all freshly prepared but the wait is not long, and it is reasonably priced.
505	1	a	Walking into this place looks nice and well kept. I liked the setup they have. I'm giving this place five star rating not for how nice and casual it is but for the food. I haven't tried everything on the menu yet, but I will that's my plan in the near future. I have had at least five items from the menu so far and I got hooked.  It all tasted to what I expected it to and I'm glad for that because there isn't a lot of kosher restaurants out here, so it's nice to know I can get kosher food in a restaurant and enjoy it. The menu selections are awesome a lot to choose from, so there's something for everybody that loves to eat from pastas to pizzas and so on. By the way this place is dairy only. Give them a try you will enjoy it.
506	1	a	Very family friendly kosher restaurant, the pizza is amazing, very fast service, taste delicious, prices are very good!!! Nathan the owner is very nice & family oriented guy that will make this place happenin!!!!
507	1	a	Great selection of delicious pizza varieties!
508	1	a	I had the privilege to come to La Bella's for lunch yesterday... I had a cheese calzone -- fresh and tasty. You can definitely tell everything here is fresh. I love the display window with the pizza, calzone and Stromboli. I will definitely be back!
509	1	a	The restaurant is still new with the new feel.  Simple fast food pizza environment  with a kosher twist.  The food tasted excellent,  the portions generous and the prices were for the most part friendly. The menu board is hard to read you'll have to catch it at the right angle to read. The decor is simple industrial with the ubiquitous concrete floor you run into almost every where now. \nDon't hesitate to visit and eat here the experience is positive for a kosher pizza joint.
510	1	a	When my friend suggested we meet for lunch at LaBella, I immediately looked it up on Yelp and read some of their stellar reviews.  I also checked out their menu online and was blown away by all of the options.  Sure, this place is Kosher / Vegetarian, but there is definitely something for everyone here.\n\nI love that it's a fast-casual concept.  Order your food at the counter and they will bring it to you when it's ready... friendly service as well.\n\nI went for the spinach salad and added salmon.  I couldn't resist picking out a slice of the eggplant pizza as well.  (I love that you can choose from tons of different pizza slices and calzones from the case right by where you place your order!)  Everything I had was fresh and delicious.  Needless to say, it filled me up for the rest of the afternoon.\n\nIf you are kosher or vegetarian or meeting someone for lunch or dinner that is either one, LaBella is a fabulous option.  They also offer take-out, delivery, and catering.
511	0	a	I've never heard of a pizza place that doesn't have real pepperoni.  The crust taste good but the sauce was very salty.  The French onion soup taste like it came from a can.  The Fettuccine Alfredo was so bland it was like they just added cream and no other flavors.  The chocolate shake was about the only thing that was good.  I'm really confused as to how this place gets so many good reviews.
512	0	a	I just ordered this got pizza Garlic bread and mozerella sticks and cheese fries well I'm from NYC and this ant no New York pizza everything was ice cold the mozerella sticks the cheese was ice cold inside didn't even stretch the cheese garlic bread was full of parsley nothing Elsa bread felt stale cheese fries was cold cheese horrible ! Never will\nOrder again never ever can eat better at dominos !
513	1	a	"Very good pizza, friendly and helpful staff, extensive menu.  And kosher to boot.  But I was not particularly enamored of the \""mexican\"" food served Tuesday's and Sundays.  Stick with the pizza."
514	1	a	I love to listen to AM Radio at night and pick up stations from all over the country, but unless my stereo is grounded properly, I get buzz and engine whine when trying to listen to a traffic report from 300 miles away.  The job they did @305 is cosmetic, gives me great reception and was done in no time.
515	1	a	Purchased a Groupon then made an appointment.  Alex was great explained all the different tints they offer. Very clean shop and waiting room with a flat screen TV... I watched a Netflix  movie while waiting. I went with the basic legal tint and it came out perfect.  I also received a warranty in writing. I was kept company by Alexs cute little docuson named Petrie.
516	1	a	I was looking for a place to help install my Sirius radio receiver in my car. After reading reviews on Yelp, 305 Kustoms seemed like the the best place to get it done. If a business replies to all the reviews on yelp, you know they truly care about their customers. I stopped by and met with Denisse and she introduced me to Alex. Alex explained in detail what he could do to make the installation look clean. I made an appointment a couple of days later. I dropped off the car and picked it up later in the afternoon. As expected, they did a great job and the installation looks great. Although I live on the east side of town, the drive was worth it. Great price and great service. I highly recommend 305 Kustoms! Thanks Denisse & Alex
517	1	a	"A friend implored me to add Asia Subba to yelp. And here is my gleeful compliance. Asia Subba opened up about a month ago, and I was waiting for the right moment to go, namely someone else offering to buy me dinner. The restaurant offers sushi, Indian and Nepalese food. We came specifically for the Nepalese food as I had never tried it before. We tried the pork , lamb, samusas and chicken fried rice. The lamb was amazing, very juicy and flavorful . All the entrees came with curried vegetables and steamed rice. There were also Nepalese pickled veggies that my friend referred to as a \""warm condiment\"". The samusas were less spiced than the Indian version that I am\nAccustomed to and my son ate his fried rice. The restaurant is clean and air conditioned! Also Mr.Subba, the owner is super friendly. Please note that the restaurant is located up stairs."
518	1	a	Great food. Cheap but high quality and nice atmosphere. Will definitely go back and recommend to friends.
519	1	a	Before giving Subba a try I have never had Nepali food before.  If you are a fan of Indian and Asian flavors - chances are you would really enjoy this place.  I decided to eat here after hearing reading several decent reviews on the Allegheny City Central Facebook page..  The food here, in my opinion, was excellent.  I shared the pan-seared Momos as an appetizer, I had the Nepali Chicken, and my boyfriend had the General Tso's chicken (he wasn't feeling as adventurous).  Everything was well-seasoned, well prepared, and delicious.  The service we had was great, very friendly and informative about the food.  \n\nI will say that Subba did not have the best ambiance and it did take awhile to get our food - even though there were not many people inside.  I know this is a new place and hopefully they are still working out some of the kinks.  I think if this place could re-decorate a bit, maybe paint, lower the lights, have some candles, and promote itself as a BYOB - I think this could be a real hidden gem.  If you feel like trying something new I recommend giving Subba a try.
520	1	a	Four of us wanted to try this restaurant before going to see a show at the Hazlett Theater.  The food was excellent. We tried both the chicken and vegetable momos (steamed dumplings); we liked them both although we all agreed that the chicken was tastier. Among us we also ordered chicken biryani, chicken curry, and a lamb and pork dish. All were good, as was the naan. We ordered primarily from the Nepali and. Indian selections. The portions are generous and the food was very inexpensive ($44 for everything). The service needs some work, so I recommend leaving sufficient time if you are going somewhere afterward. Entrees were brought out one at a time (well, one, then another one, then two), but since we were all sharing it did not matter as much. I will definitely go back.
521	1	a	My roommate told me I had to try Nepal food, and apparently this is the place to do it.  Holy crap is this place a great value.  If Nepali food isn't your cup of tea, they have chinese and indian food as well (I haven't had a chance to try those yet).  As other people have said the momo dumplings are worth trying (you get around 10-12 for $5) and you could probably make your meal out of just that.  The mango lassi might be the best lassi I've ever had. \n\nThe decor could use a little updating, but you're here for the food. Service was good and the food came out very quickly.  The place is also BYOB.  Subba is a hidden gem and worth checking out.
522	0	a	Upon hearing that there was a Nepali restaurant in the Northside I wanted to obviously give it a try. I however have not tried it. The photo of the menu on urban spoon apparently is wrong... this caused some confusion and as I tried to order the person on the phone became short with me and tried forcing me into a dish I did not want. I see the reviews and am sure the food is great but will never attempt to return due to the extremely poor attitude.
523	1	a	Subba is located at the corner of East Ohio and Cedar on Pittsburgh's lovely northside on the second floor of a very unassuming building.  When we arrived, the owner (I think) was in the kitchen helping the chef.  I know this because a friendly family that dines there all the time, and the restaurant's only guests last night, told me so.  We took a seat and he came out shortly thereafter to greet us with a mile-wide grin.  \n\nI ordered the Lamb Nepali and my mumsie ordered the Chicken Nepali.  I wasn't sure what to expect, but what arrived was a series of small silver bowls with a variety of ingredients surrounding a bed of jasmine (I think) rice.  I threw everything onto the rice and hoped for the best.  I was not disappointed.  Nepali not your thing?  Subba also offers a Chinese menu so you can chow on General Tso's 'til your heart's content (and it did look delicious).  At $25 total for the two of us, it was a cheap date and the food was wonderful.  On the spicy side, so be forewarned, but a lovely departure from the casino buffet which we were tempted to drown ourselves in after losing our collective shirts at Rivers earlier that day.  \n\nGive Subba a try. The owner is so sweet and the food so delicious - truly a diamond in the rough.
524	1	a	I LOVE their food, especially the Nepali dishes. \n\nThe only caution I give is to perhaps avoid the Szechuan Beef. \n\nWhen I got it, a lot of the pieces of beef were leather tough and there was not a hint of spicyness in this. I hope it was just a fluke/one time thing.
525	1	a	I've tried pilates at a few other places, but after 1 lesson with Melissa I was hooked!  She is a great motivator and super knowledgeable.  She makes an effort to really get to know her clients so she can help you reach your goals.  Plus, she is hilarious and entertaining.  The studio is immaculate as well.  The service you receive here will not let you down!
526	1	a	I went here the other night with my friend who grew up in China. One of my other friends highly reccommended this place and said it was authentic Taiwanese food. Of course, I had to go and try it! My friend likes to order lots of food. I told her to pick whatever she wants because she has good tastes, so I have no idea what she ordered. Haha.  We had hot and sour soup, eggplants with something, 3 cup chicken, and fish filet with bean paste. I wasn't a fan of the 3 cup chicken. The flavoring was a bit weird maybe it was because they put too much basil.  I loved the eggplant and the fish filet. It was so awesome! The eggplant was very refreshing and very delicious. The fish filet was so awesome! It was huge too! I was stuffed because I ate so much!\n\nI did have an issue with my credit card. I got a notification (I get text alerts everytime my credt card is charge), and I got charged twice. They also overcharged. We split the bill, and they charged me $5 more. They fixed refunded me one of the charges and charged me the right price. On their end, it only showed one charge. They did tell us to come back if the charge did show up on my cc. They did call my friend a few days later (She left her number) and asked if I had been overcharged which was nice of them.  \n\nThe servers were very attentive, and I liked the fact that they let us stay past closing and did not try to kick us out. And it was very sweet of them to call to check if I was overcharged.
527	1	a	A good spot if you're looking for some good Taiwanese style cooking!  \n\nPork chop with sticky rice over yams (or pumpkin or seasonal yams) - I've had this dish three times here and each time it's awesome even though the yams or pumpkin underneath has always changed.  But the pork chop is still very tasty!\n\nGlass noodles with minced pork - Had for the first time tonight and it's very simple but very flavorful.\n\nGarlic stir-fry of seasonal vegetables - This dish is pretty standard in all asian restaurants, nothing special but solid dish nonetheless.\n\nTofu stir fry with eggplant - I didn't care too much for this dish, a bit light in flavor for me.\n\nMapo Tofu - Classic tofu dish that's very tasty.\n\nThe meal also comes with some white rice or brown rice if you ask.  The service was great, Rebecca is very attentive and wonderful.
528	0	a	To be honest, I really enjoy the chinese food, but not this one. My wife and I were setting there like 45 mins, the food that we ordered were take forever. I don't know why they took so long. They mess up the chinese food, shame on them.
529	1	a	Their specialty is sliders. I tried the crab cake slider which was well seasoned (I'm from Maryland) with a remoulade sauce. My man went with the steak slider complete with a chimichurri sauce and friend plantain. Went back for seconds and gobbled up their gouda mac and cheese. Be on the lookout for this truck!
530	1	a	Met these guys at a Yelp party.  The crab cake slider was wonderful.  Tons of flavor.  Also had a steak slider that was very good but the crab cake stole the show!   The owners were very friendly.  I'll be looking for these guys next time I'm in Charlotte!!!
531	1	a	This place has great pizza. I have never been a fan of white pizza but it unbelievable here. U gotta try it. I called and asked if they can do half white and half regular.  He said he can whatever I like which was nice. I've beem here about 5x since it opened, mainly bc it is super close to my house. The pizza is 5 star quality, however,  they need to revamp their appetizers.  Place woukd be 5 stars ez w better items besides the pizza. Definitely recommend the pizza here.
532	1	a	I have been craving a good Antipasto. I found it ! Will be back !
533	0	a	The only good thing about this place is they have a student deal: two pieces of cheese and a fountain soda for 4.50. The pizza doesnt have much flavor. They charge for bad ranch. By the way, there is no pesto.
534	1	a	I'm always on a quest for real thin crust NY pizza. Stumbled upon Rocco's on my visit to Vegas. This place is the real deal! Fantastic pizza! I wish we had a Rocco's here in LA. Can't wait to go back!
535	1	a	I have tried every, and I do mean every mobile detailer in the valley since my job requires me to never be available to go to a detailer and although these detailers are better than the typical mass car detailers and automated machine washes - nothing compared to the service and amazing quality I received at Race Day. After just their wash and rim cleaning, my car looked like I had just left the show room with it, it's a  2012, they removed ALL the swirl marks on my black Mustang, and completed the opti-coat pro package. I hardly ever post a review but it has been 3 weeks since my detail and today when I came out to look at my car it still looks like i just got it detailed! I will never use another detailer again - Ask for Alan to be your detailer of choice!!!
536	1	a	I'm amazed at what a spectacular job Alan did with detailing my car. He treated it like it was an art project, detailing every single crevice. He is such a perfectionist and spent 7 hours on my car at the flat price. I couldnt believe it. Not to mention the engine clean he did. It looks better than it did when it was new. So clean that I took my shoes off to get into it! The best part is that they are mobile so they come to you and you dont have to wait at the carwash for hours and hours. This is the BEST detailing company I've ever experienced.I have written one Yelp review in my life. I am a full time graduate student and full time nurse but I just had to take the time to recommend this company. They are simply the best!
537	1	a	I only got ice cream but it is the same quality as other Dairy Queen locations.  \n\nThis location has burgers, hot dogs, chicken, fries and much much more.\n\n$5 lunches are a popular hit.\n\nEat in or take out.  This location has a really nice outdoor seating are too.
538	0	a	1st visit chili dogs were good. 2nd visit the ice cream sandwiches had ice crystals in the ice cream. 3rd and last visit the chili dog was not even cooked. They put a cold uncooked hotdog on a bun and poured hot chili over it...yuck!!   Next time,  I will drive to the hotdog restaurant near Tempe Towne Marketplace.
539	0	a	Came in 2mins late for the 5 buck lunch speical asked the manager if i could still get the 5 buck meal deal since i was 2mins late phoenix traffic which am not use to since in tucson none of the dq in town have food so after a 2 hour drive i was turn away from the special which didnt matter cause the cheeseburger meal i wanted was cheaper note to self this locate need a real big customer service training
540	1	a	New bakery just opens in squirell hill.  Delicious and feasible single serve desserts. Will add more but safe to say this place is a hit.
541	1	a	Pink box is brand new in what is quickly becoming a very crowded bakery rich stretch on Murray ave.\n\nPink box is a Chinese bakery with lots of buns.\n\nWe a each got one. One was like frosting covered and the other was cream filled.  All that and they have a cookies and more traditional desserts.\n\nI haven't had anything bad from here yet.
542	0	a	Bought three pastries here. One of them was good, service was a little sketchy, I'm pretty sure the lady at the register pulled a Houdini and double charged us 7 dollars. Authentic taste, but I want my money back #wheredembands
543	1	a	The only proper Asian bakery in all of Pittsburgh! \n\nIt's definitely pricey, but I have no limit to how much I will spend on sweets, and especially Asian goodies.  Egg tarts and hands down my favorite dessert and the ones here are passable.  I've tried everything here it seems and I've decided:\n\n-I don't like their red bean products\n-I don't like their taro products\n-I don't like their moon cakes\n-I like their cream pastries\n-I love their almond flaky bread and will get it every time
544	0	a	I was disappointed with my first trip here and decided to give it another shot so I stopped in for a couple treats.  The cakes were wonderfully presented and looked delicious.  They're on the smaller side so I picked up 3 for my companion and I.  The white chocolate mousse cake was EXTREMELY sweet, to the point neither of us could take more than 2 bites, and I LOVE sweets.  I don't think I've ever said something was too sweet.  We had to throw the rest of it away.  We got the cheesecake as well which was ok, nothing special.  Our final dessert was the tiramisu which had a bottom that tasted chalky.  We ended up throwing it away too.  \n\nThe presentation is wonderful but deceptive, imo
545	0	a	In all fairness, it may not be a hangout for me but I can see this being a successful place for the b&t crowd! My 2 stars are based on the $10 lunch menu which was so so...I had a salad which was salty and a pork burger that was mayonnaisey... Not a success but I'll give this place another chance since it's new and not an expensive lunch! I will base a new review on that...later dudes
546	1	a	Ouvert depuis hier, j'y allais par hasard. Agr\u00e9ablement surprise. Le Pompeii et le Berlusconi valent le d\u00e9tour. Comme nous sommes arriv\u00e9s apr\u00e8s 10 hres, les plats et pizzas \u00e9taient \u00e0 10$.\n\nJ'ai bien aim\u00e9 la Big Mac Pizza
547	0	a	"In all fairness, I expected to love this place...the menu looked great and I had heard good things so I'm disappointed by how disappointed I was. \n\nMy boyfriend and I went Saturday night with an 8:45pm reservation. The place was full and the decoration and vibe were very nice. Our hostess apologized for our small table and offered to have us wait to be seated at another - we assured her that it was fine. \n\nAs I said, the menu looked delicious and we had a hard time choosing what to eat.\n\nWe ordered Aperol Spritz to start - it was good and authentic so no complaints there,\n\nWe were then told they had run out of the wine we ordered - which was fine too, we chose another. I suppose this threw the waitress off because she came back to ask what our food order was again. \n\nWe started off with the charcuterie plate - and were disappointed. At 25$ it was a good size with quite a bit of cured meat BUT only 3 types: mortadella, pancetta and salami...the most basic varieties of Italian deli meat with some pickled vegetables. I would even be willing to let this go as \""authentic Italian brasserie\"" if they were outstanding but they were slimy and not very fresh. \n\nWe then tried the papardelle bolognese - the meat and sauce were very good. \n\nAs a main dish, my boyfriend ordered the bistecca well done. It arrived bloody and he was forced to send it back. As she took it, the waitress asked if it would be ok if they just put the same piece of meat on the grill and brought it back to him...at a loss, he answered \""yeah sure\"". It arrived medium-rare. \n\nMy main dish was the porchetta burger. I'm a BIG fan of porchetta and couldn't wait to try it. It tasted off and the rest of the \""burger\"" toppings didn't seem to go well with it. I couldn't stomach it after forcing down half. (I later got violently sick...but that's another tangent)\n\nWe declined dessert and asked for our bill. Our waitress kindly told us that she hadn't charged us the bistecca and a manager came over to apologize for the mistake. He seemed quite upset about it and we assured him it was fine. \n\nAs my boyfriend went to pay the bill however, I noticed that we had been charged for our initial wine selection which they had run out of.  Another small detail. \n\nOverall, I was really let down by the food and the service. The waitresses were distracted and not very knowledgeable and while I can certainly forgive small oversights, there were quite a few of them. I was most let down by the food, which ultimately got me sick....\n\n I had heard good things about the place which, after I mentioned my experience, were met with \""oh but it was empty when I went and I just tried the pizza\"" - so I guess it's better when it's not busy and I should have ordered the pizza?"
548	0	a	The taste and texture of the gnocchi was very good. Usually, it is an indicator of a good Italian fare. The pizza was served cold on a thick tasteless crust. It lacked the freshness of the tomatoes and basil that you would expect from an Italian chef. The steak ordered medium came to the table well done. The plate was left untouched and the staff did not even care about inquiring. The service is extremely slow yet the staff is very courteous. Not worth the investment.
549	0	a	I came to place an order for a birthday cake. The open sign was on, so I proceed to open the door. The few people that were inside started making some gestures i didn't understand. Then a man came closer, and with very rude gestures pointed a some small later that said: closed on Wednesday. \nIt would only take him a second to open the door, and say: we are close today. I apologize for the inconvenience. \nI simply drove two blocks down, and went to Roly's bakery, where they happily helped me. \nThere are many restaurants in town that make great cuban food. If you don't provide good customer service, you are out of the game. Learn the business.
550	1	a	Pizzas are exquisite! Authentic Cuban flavor! Batidos(milkshakes) are creamy and made with real fruit! Must go place! The owner is very friendly!
551	0	a	Yo paso por ese sitio y no habia nada dolamente pizza, pregunte por pastelillos no habian pregunte por croquetas no habian no voy mas y no lo recomiendo mejor voy a Rolys
552	0	a	Mal organisado, no habia nada pregubte por pastelillos no habian pregunte por Sandwiches no habian y tampoco croquetas, Rolys es el mejor
553	1	a	Best dollar store EVER! My goodness this place is huge and has everything you can imagine and a ton of other things you didn't know you wanted. They always have a large and awesome selection of themed products for every holiday and occasion. I saw the coolest Halloween decorations the other day and picked up accessories for my costume. I also loved how sweet the employees were and was pleasantly surprised to find out that they're an independent, family owned store. I dare you to walk and attempt to control your ideas. It's impossible because this place just inspires you to create a ton of projects. #DollarStoreLove #ShopDollarMania
554	0	a	Went in to race Saturday 7/13/2014. All was well until I received a work related phone call. Due to the loudness of the loudspeaker, i had to seek refuge in an area of the building where i could hear my phone call. Considering the policy on exiting the back door was changed today, i was forced to stand in the area to the east of the rear door to hear my phone call, rather than walking across the the building to exit the front door.\n\nI was approached by a guy with a walkie talkie who interrupted my phone call to tell me to leave the area i was in. I moved a few feet to away and was immediately approached again and ushered back into the area where hearing the phone call was not possible. I made my way to another area and was ushered away by the same guy, mind you im on a business call with a client in North Dakota. After struggling to hear my client for at least 5 minutes, I ended the call. The entire time i was on the call, the guy was watching me as if i was trying to steal something. I felt unwanted at this place so i packed up my pit and unregistered from the race. \n\nI went to the hobby shop for a refund, since my car hadn't touched the track. Yet again met another rude, pissed off employee who seemed burdened by my request, and denied my refund due to not being sure if I practiced......I advised the situation I just encountered, and nothing was said from the employee. I said keep the money and left... \n\nDo yourself a favor, avoid this place and go elsewhere. The track is so/so and the race director is terrible, always talking to his friends via the loudspeaker during races, calls incorrect times, just all around not organized and bad. I will NEVER be returning to this track, and will try my best to deter anyone from going here.
555	0	a	"Staff as a whole was very polite and personable. While interacting with the staff we discussed putting each other \""into to the wall\"" when Carlo, who I assume is the manager, stated we would be kicked out without a refund. I smiled and said we were just joking. \n\nRan our race and had a blast until the second to last lap when I passed my friend and we did rub. Carlo couldn't run fast enough from his place behind the counter to grab a black flag and pounce. Fortunately it was the final lap by the time he got to the track and we exited the track. \n\nAgain, the staff as a whole is very good. Young people having fun at a fun job. The facility is worth the $17 to race for 7 mins. \nCaptain Carlo on the other hand is a huge deterrent and is enough to keep me from returning."
556	0	a	I wouldn't recommend this store to anyone.  Horrible customer service!  I recently moved to AZ and have been looking for a hobby shop.  I went into Hobby Town in the beginning of December.  I was looking to buy a RC truck for my son whom is 3.  I had my son with me to see what style he wanted.   I had a few questions. I approached the cashier area.  Where one employee was, he said hi.  He didn't ask if I need help with anything. Trying to start the conversation. I said 'hi I a truck for my son.'   He just stared at me, and said nothing.  My son started getting excited as he normally does, he said something like 'I want a monster truck. '  The male didn't even acknowledge that he was there.  I have gone into other hobby stores in my home city. The employees are normally happy to talk about stuff they have in the store, and really anything to do with the hobby.  But, this guy just looked at me. So I said 'my is already flying a 3 channel helicopter and now he wants a monster truck.'   Again, no response.   He looked like he didn't want to be, and didn't want to be bother.  So, I left. \nI went to Ducan RC.  In less than 5 min, they answered all of my question. And even recommended several different options.   They also acknowledged my son.  \nThis made me even more irritated with the service I received at Hobby town.  The service I received told me Hobby town doesn't care about making any sales.  That they don't want customers.  The fact that their employee was about as helpful as a brick wall I am surprised they are still in business.  \nI ended up buying my son a Traxxas slash somewhere else. I needed a few more things, extra battery and better charger.  My wife said, just stop into Hobby Town (since its about 5 mins from my house)  maybe that guy was just having a bad day.  So, I thought she's most like right.  Can't fault a company for just one employee having a bad day.  It was a little more busy this time.  So, I was looking the batteries in the cases and chargers.  The feel was more friendly.  The employees were joking with customer, smiling and having a good time.  I thought ok this is more like a hobby store.  So,  I waited.  Then one employee, rushed by me, pretty close to running into me.  He didn't say anything.  I thought that was rude.  But, patiently waited.  Most of the customer except for one, who was looking at parts, had left.  So, walked towards the cashier area.  Where I walked straight back in to the grim blank stare looking employees.  'No acknowlegement, no Hi did you have any questions.'  I walked straight out of there, regretting that I even went back it there at all.  \nI am not saying their employees should run and greet you at the door. But a pretty common practice for any business is when you have a customer come in, say hi to them.  This place is a joke.   After my experience with Hobby Town I won't be going to Hobby Town, the rc track, or the karting track.  They basically let 350 bucks walk out the door.  I will drive out of the state if I have to buy something than go in there.   Lucky I don't have to, I just have to drive a couple extra minutes south to Ducans RC.  If you are looking for a good friendly hobby store drive past Hobby Town.
557	1	a	Great fish and scallop !!!! Great addition to the Goodyear neighborhood. Family owed.
558	1	a	Finally, a place that serves good quality seafood in West Valley! I thought it'd never existed until we went to Ada's. Their fried fish just melts in your mouth and I'm a huge fan of their homemade coleslaw. Their breading is light, crunchy and nicely seasoned. Ada's is bringing the typical fish and chips to another level. Now they just need to get some beers in there and they're all set. I didn't give them the full 5-star because our fries were a little soggy. No biggie! We can tell they care and have huge passion for their food and service. Keep that up and the place could survive in the volatile West Valley restaurant industry. We'll be back!
559	1	a	Food was amazing.  Got the fish and scallop combo with onion rings.  It came out hot and fresh.  The owner said he gets the fish twice a week.  Great food great service.
560	1	a	The fish was hot crispy the fries were the bomb oh ig you like onion rings make sure you get some onion rings not a fan of the coleslaw but everything else was delicious
561	1	a	My family and I went to Ada's last night.  The fish, shrimp, scallops and clams were all super fresh and super crispy! Ada's knows how to deliver simple yet  exceptional seafood. The fries and onion rings were also crunchy and delicious.
562	1	a	It didn't take me long to find the restaurant.  I was a little surprised that the place was almost empty at lunchtime on a Saturday.  Maybe they have more business at night.  I was impressed with the quality of the fish.  Onion rings are the real deal.  Server was nice.  Cook was nice.  Coleslaw was good.  Shrimp was amazing.  I will definitely go back.  I hope they stay in business because the prices seemed a little steep.
563	1	a	This place is very good. Great scallops, clams. Very friendly and a nice portion of food. To bad not open on Sundays
564	0	a	Ordered two burgers and two waters, 30 minutes later we get our water fresh from the well a mile away and was told that our order was to be another 30-45 minutes so we just left. I'm sure the food is great but I don't agree with terrible service before I get to even taste it. I'm not sure what the problem was, the waitress even forgot that she had taken our orders 30 minutes before or the incompetent manager wandering aimlessly and not knowing how to run a restaurant.. One star for bow since all I got to experience was their terrible service.
565	0	a	"Living in the small town of Queen Creek, it is hard to find a \""new\"" place to eat that we haven't already tried a dozen of times. I recently heard about Dave's Original Hamburgers through a community post. My friend and I decided to give it a try one night since they were running a double cheeseburger with bacon special and we both had a hankering for hamburgers. We pulled into the dirt lot and my first thought was \""how cute! Kinda shabby chic and a little bit odd. I like it.\"" The restaurant looks like an old house converted into a restaurant. The mismatched tables and chairs and small space gave it a cozy feel. Again, the decor is far from lackluster but my guess is that is the exact look they were going for. Onto the service and good. We decided we were going to take our food home. We were immediately given menus by the waitress. As we looked over the menu, she took our orders. I started out saying, \""can I please have...\"" and then she cut me off and said \""no, sorry you can't have that\"" - I quickly caught on to her dry sarcasm and laughed but after every thing I said, she would make the same \""no, you can't have that\"" comment. It got old pretty quickly. I mean, just take my order already please! We finally put our orders in (I got the double cheeseburger with bacon special and my friend got a burger with green chile's and we decided to split a side of jalape\u00f1o poppers.) Ten minutes later, the waitress returned with our food. She said, \""we ran out of plastic bags so we put it in a cardboard box for you. Makes you feel like you're on a Chinese restaurant, right?\"" Oh. My. Gosh. Are you kidding? I'm Japanese, so I don't feel like this was a racial attack, but wow, that comment was certainly made in poor taste. This short experience really just left a bad taste in my mouth (pun intended). The food was okay. We'd rather go to In-N-Out which is better in taste, cheaper in price, and with EXCELLENT service. I think the owners need to teach a thing or two about customer service and class to their wait staff. I'm really sad to give this review because I truly do love supporting small local businesses. I won't be back."
566	0	a	In a word...RIDICULOUS! We waited 15 minutes to be seated another 20 to get drinks and about 40 minutes for our food. If your keeping time thats 1 hour and 15 minutes to get TWO burgers and fries. Well, maybe the burgers and fries were amazing...NOPE. The food was meh...nothing to write home about. What a shame I had high hopes. The staff kept apologizing but offered no discount or free items. Well, I take that back about 45 minutes in they brought us a tray of carrots and celery with a side of store bought ranch...I'm here for a burger lady not rabbit food. I will say our waitress (young red hair) did keep her smile and professionalism, that was really the only redeeming factor of the place. I would not recommend this place at all. \n\nANOTHER IMPORTANT NOTE: They had a unchained Pitbull running around with kids outside the place. Don't you people read the news? An animal can turn at any time. This made us feel unsafe for sure!!!
567	1	a	The burgers deserve 5 stars - the location and setting drops the overall review to 4 stars. The grill is located in an old house. There is limited indoor seating (not ideal in Summer) but lots of outdoor seating (7-8 months out of the year, this will be fantastic).\n\nStaff was crazy friendly and helpful! They treat you great. The Double Cheeseburger was the best I have had in Arizona since moving here 5 years ago. \n\nIf you're in Queen Creek - hit this place up.
568	0	a	Showed up at 7pm on a Tuesday which to me seems like one of the slowest days of the week for any restaurant. However it was not a slow night even though it was not a full house there (about half the tabkes occupied). I may be wrong but it seemed like only one server/hostess was working the floor. Like another reviewer said... it took them a few minutes to acknowledge that we were there, then we sat ourselves outside, then we waited another 10 minutes for them to come get drink orders... and that is when we were warned that it would be an hour before our food order would be started on due to orders inside and take-out orders. Since we had 3 kids and it was a school night we jumped ship.\n\nSo I cant judge the food but this new place needs work on managing its customer workload. For a place that was half full it doesnt bode well with people to wait an hour for food, much less the time just to be seated and drinks/orders taken. And I say this as someone who generally views dining out as an event rather than a 5 minute face-cram, serve me NOW.\n\nI would like to see this little unique spot succeed but if they have time management issues like this then I feel they are going to have a steep hill to climb to be successful.
569	0	a	Burger was really good. Big juicy tasty meaty cheesy.  Big hit!\n\nOnion rings are crispy and have onions in them.  Can't say much else good. Too greasy for me. \n\nFries were cold, limp, bland. Total fail on fries.
570	1	a	Found this little place on yelp. Found the reviews right on. Not always the case. Burgers perfect size and cooked perfectly. Had daves double with cheese. Meat had a wonderful flavor  onion rings are worth going there just for them. Will go back.
571	0	a	I ordered the Super Salad as a takeout.  They put very hot grilled chicken on lettuce and cheddar cheese.  By the time I was back at work 10 minutes later, I had a greasy, wilted mess.  It was inedible due to the cooked lettuce and grease.  Chucked it in the garbage and ate oatmeal.  Sorry go give you a bad review, but the food was just yuck!
572	1	a	I've been a fan of this pool service since before the name changed. I can always rely on our pool guy Chad to keep our pool crystal clear even though I am pretty far from his normal service area. (I'm in Mesa.) \n\nRecently though, I was having a lot of trouble with a new vacuum purchased from my old pool service company. Chad explained the pros and cons of the pressure vac that I had versus a suction vac. I decided to convert my system to suction, and the job was done the following week on my normal service day. The new system works great and looks awesome too. I can definitely say that he gave me a feeling of confidence as far as what I was getting for my money. \n\nKeep up the good work, and thanks.
573	1	a	"You must check out this place!!!!!  I went there for dinner tonight, and it was amazing!!!  Beautiful, cozy atmosphere, and great food choices!!  No matter what style of food you feel like, they will have a dish to satisfy your pallet.  \nThe cold pressed juices are delicious!!!  Not to mention the high end cocktails that you can get mixed with the juices!!  What's better than enjoying a cocktail and knowing it's actually \""healthy\""!!!!!!????  Can't see a better combo!!  \nPlease go, try it...I can't see how you won't love the place yourself!!!"
574	1	a	Love this place! The service staff was super friendly. My friends and I shared a couple different plates. We really enjoyed the enchiladas and the veggie burger has tons of flavor. I can't wait to get back in there to try more food and check out some of the cocktails!
575	0	a	"DON'T BOTHER ~ YOU WON'T BE ABLE TO FIND IT ANYWAY WITH THEIR SIGN REVERSED AND UNREADABLE!   \nI don't who wrote these other reviews, but I think they were written by insiders or employees. \nWent on a Friday night at 7:30 & there was hardly anyone there...  A table of 4 & a table of 6 were quickly seated after we got there. \nThe decor is nice but has a strange room at the far end of the restaurant that is a half glass wall with a bunch of TV's & seating. \nAfter a while it occurred to me as to why this room looked so strange... It was just like what you'd see in an upscale hotel, especially for a wedding party, banquet, meeting administrators, etc...  \nThat's when everything else made sense...  such as:  getting the menu. \nIt was printed on a cheap piece of paper & the menu items were very limited but PRICEY!! \nSalads were $13 not including $6 for chicken (if you want it added). \nSandwiches were all starting at $13 and the entrees were starting at $18. \nAll the meals come by itself & the \""sides\"" are all extra, starting at $8.00! \nAfter we sat there for 10 min. finally this guy cautiously approached us & stood about 10 feet from our table & after an awkward pause he asked us if we were being helped?  \nReally weird! \nWe asked what draft beer he recommended... ALL OF THEM, he says... again, really strange.  \nWe ordered the kale citrus salad ($8.00) & enchiladas ($20) w/ an extra plate as we were going to share. \nAgain, we asked the waiter what dish was most popular & he responds with  EVERYTHING is GOOD!! ... okay you're really helpful. \nAfter about 20 more minutes we flagged down the waiter & asked if our salad was coming out anytime soon? He said (I kid you not), I was going to bring it out with the entree!! \nThankfully our salad came out but then the \""shock\"" set in. The waiter brought out a huge plate with this 4 inch diameter bowl w/ about 3 oz of salad in this tiny bowl. \nI was so shocked I immediately asked him if this was our salad? he replies, Oh Yes!   \nI then asked him if this was the $8.00 salad and he just stares at me... (another awkward pause)... then he asks me if I want to talk to the manager?  \nI just gave up & said no. Obviously this was not a mistake and there was no reason for me to go on and complain about it ... \nWe each picked up our fork and ate (maybe) 3 small bites each of salad & it was gone. \nJust then the enchiladas were brought out on another large platter/plate. \nAgain shock set in. \nThey were the smallest enchiladas I've ever seen and there were 3 of them on this huge plate. \nThe tortilla shells were a little bigger than a street taco size but not quite big enough for a larger taco traditionally found in mexican restaurants. \nThey were extremely hard & very difficult to cut through with a knife. My initial bite was lukewarm with the shell being extremely hard & the inside meat being almost cold. \nIt was supposed to be tri-tip but it was not!! (we know steak meat) ... plus there was hardly any meat in the enchilada. \nThere was sauce on top which was absolutely disgusting. \nIt was obvious this was some kind of wine sauce but the wine had not been reduced correctly so the sauce was absolutely bitter & inedible. \nMy husband & I were so shocked by the total experience that we weren't paying attention to what was going on around us. \nThe table of 6 had just left after a bit of a commotion. My husband observed that the man at the head of the table asked to speak to the manager & then the whole table got up & left, leaving 6 meals almost untouched. \nWe don't know if they paid or had a family emergency or what, but it seemed very strange. \nRight about then, I happened to notice the 4 people sitting near us & all of their food that had come out at the same time as our enchiladas were all in doggy bags! \nNow they were leaving. \nAfter our experience with the ridiculously small portions and poor taste, I would venture to say we weren't the only ones EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED in this pretty expensive meal.\nNow everything made sense... the owners must be ex-hotel restaurant owners where you have captured customers that will pay a high price for under-sized portions. \nNeedless to say I will NOT be back nor will I be recommending this place to anyone."
576	0	a	Want to like it but place was empty, average overpriced food. Backwards sign in a hidden location. I give it six months and it will most likely meet the same fate of the others who have tried to make it in this location.
577	1	a	A great ambience and good food. A little pricy, but I hope this place is here to stay. \n\nIt reminds me of the Lux, where it's multiple things in one. There is a bar inside and outside, dining area, and an area in the back called marketplace for juice and breakfast. The entire place is massive.\n\nI live close by, so I'll be back for sure.
578	0	a	We had hoped we would have been pleasantly surprised, as nothing in this spot has ever lasted very long, and we live in this neighborhood.   The parking lot was empty, as well as the restaurant (we were the only ones there) and we were there at lunch time.  The restaurant is beautiful and very well appointed.  We found the menu interesting but very limiting.  Our server was extremely nice and our meal was okay. I believe, they are looking to cater to a certain clientele, but I don't think they are in the right area for that. They seem to be going after the True Food crowd..but this doesn't cut it.  They have a market area, that really had very little in it, except for dozens of pop chip bags on the shelf.  I hope they make it, I don't think they will.
579	1	a	Amazing food! Amazing ambiance! Excellent service. The GM came to talk with us and everything! Everyone come check out this new restaurant!
580	1	a	Delicious!! The food was amazing and the service was amazing! We had the tri-tip enchiladas and the hangar steak with chicken wings for the app. Everything was cooked correctly (the cucumber ranch sauce was to die for) and was presented beautifully. Not a lot of patrons but we went at an off time. The waiter was super attentive and the decor was very nice. I highly recommend seeking this hidden gem out it if you're in the area!
581	1	a	Great atmosphere, comfort food with a modern elegant twist.  Best dog friendly patio in Scottsdale.  We will be regulars.
582	1	a	I've now been here four times and love it! The happy hour prices are a steal and the daily specials ($1 champagne and $15 bottle and bruschetta) are great deals. The patio and outside bar are fantastic, and the Food is delicious! I highly recommend trying this hidden gem out!
583	1	a	Love this place!! I went to it because I saw a Yelp Ad for it when it first opened up. One of the owners, Allen, greeted me at the door and took a great interest in what I thought about the food since they had just opened. I ordered the veggie platter for a take out lunch and was pleasantly surprised by a neat concoction of local fresh grilled veggies including asparagus and artichoke!  Apparently they change this dish up depending on what's in season and on the shelf. I took my parents there shortly after and they LOVED it! So we went back again with some guests visiting from out of town. Every time, amazing food!! And I just love that some dishes use local produce! \n\nThere's a big room in the back perfect for parties. And it's a great place for a first date!
584	0	a	Let me sum up the place in one word.... Incompetent. \n\nI have been to the Standard before and the food was good. So I decided to take my girlfriend there tonight and what a mistake that was. When we arrived we asked to be seated outside. The hostess took us to our table and Said a waiter would be by for our order \n\n5 mins go by and the hostess comes back with water (still no waiter). All of the waiters were inside putting lights on the tables. Let me remind you, we were the only table with guest at  it so it's not like they were busy. \n\nAnother two minutes go by and I ask the hostess to please get us a waiter. Finally a waiter comes out that was already cut for the night and takes our drink order. We are the passed from one waiter back to the hostess. \n\nAs you can see no on talks. They are too busy putting lights on tables. \n\nWe finally order and it takes 30mins for our food to arrive. During this time another couple arrives and sits behind us. They didn't seem to have an issue getting food. In fact both of there appetizers arrived before our 1 salad and 1 pasta dish. \n\nour food arrives and its.....inedible. The salmon on the salad is cold and the steak on the pasta might as well be a hockey puck.\n\nI walk into the restaurant and hand the waitress my card so we can leave. The manager the whole time is standing outside on his phone. It then dawns on me that the problem all along is that the manager is too busy on his phone than to help his staff. \n\nSave your money and go elsewhere. If the manager doesn't care to help his guest or staff you shouldn't care to go.
585	0	a	Worst experience!!! We sat down and our host had to come over 3 times before our waitress even came over. And come to find out the hostess was our server. Apparently some miscommunication between the staff. The place was dead and another couple that had arrived 10 minutes after us got an appetizer before our order was even taken. They were over staffed. We could see four servers stranding around talking. It took almost 40 minutes for us to get our food and it was terrible! Paid the bill and got out of there. My boyfriend spoke with the manager who was outside on his cell phone and he managed our concerns very poorly. Didn't even offer to take care of part of he meal or offer us some sort of deal to come back. Terrible service, terrible food. Never going back again!
586	1	a	Great food, friendly staff, unique layout so you can see everything going on in the kitchen.  They also have a wide variety of foods from smoothies to booze.  They can accommodate you.
587	1	a	I wanted to go back and try this place for lunch today. I had the brussels sprout salad with chicken, absolutely delicious!! I met up with a friend of mine it was her first time eating there she loved it too. \nTry desert for the first time. Chocolate beet cake. Love it!!
588	0	a	food is awful\nprices are too expensive for what you get\nand the teas were awful\nsteak was not real steak it was covered with a sauce and the fries was gross\nalso, the caesar was not real caesar it had tomatoes and the dressing was awful\nthe carpet was dirty\nhard to find
589	0	a	"Came here for Sunday brunch with a group of friends and all excited to try it out as we had heard some great thing ... But left really disappointed\nTo start, Waited over ten minutes for drinks and a Bloody Mary that tasted like sink water with an entire jar of pepper... Also had a side of arugula come out with dirt all over it. \nFood was mediocre and came out all cold and had to send a dish back to even melt the cheese. Another friend had a hair in his meal. \nWe even tried to ask another blonde waitress for help and before we got what we were asking for she responded \""ya ya ya\"" ... Haha thanks for not helping and being a nice person \nAnd I understand splitting a check 15 ways sucks but was a bit of a process that took more than 30 minutes \nThis would be a one star but I've served and a lot of the issues was not our servers fault ... He was nice enough to take the dish with hair and terrible drinks off our tab. This falls on the kitchen and bar- I'll be surprised if this place makes it"
590	0	a	In short, just another Scottsdale hack of a restaurant.  I really do not understand how they got all these positive reviews, though if you peruse the highlights they don't seem to mention anything specific.\n\nOur meals were off today so we came in for dinner around 450pm.  The place was pretty dead as expected.  They started to seat us in the main dining room and then changed course to the sectioned off area which wasn't bad until a baby started screaming.  The little section is nice and cozy but has nothing to absorb sound so even with the family and us it got loud enough to have to yell.\n\nThe decor is very nice.  I really like the finishes they chose and the furniture is pretty classic.  There are numerous TVs which were nice too since we wanted to watch football.  There were actually 2 in the little living room and they were kind enough to change the channel so we can watch both the 49ers/seahawks and broncos/chargers game.  The service was VERY slow considering there were all of 3 tables to serve in the whole place, but we didn't mind til the end of the game.  I guess maybe they want to keep the Sandbar vibe alive?\n\nAnyway, the food:  we started with the pretzels - basically 3 pretzel rolls.  They were actually pretty good.  They came with a mustard vinaigrette that I thought was creative (my friend did not like it much) and a cheese sauce that I thought was not very good.  I'm not sure if it was their take on pimento cheese?  It was decent, but here's the thing - it was 10 bucks and some places give it away with dinner.  It wasn't special enough or portioned well enough to warrant the price tag.\n\nI got the taco plate - they didn't have duck so I took the chicken, beef, and fish.  They all sounded good with different slaws and aoli, etc.  Unfortunately they meant sliced cabbage and carrots and not a whole lot of sauce you can taste.  One of the tacos had kale and half of the pieces in the taco were yellow.  The chicken taco somehow was so soggy that the tortilla was soaked through before the plate got to the table.  The tacos were pretty inedible by themselves, I would definitely recommend asking for some hot sauce or salsa.  \n\nMy friend had the standard burger and it actually came with the best thing we had there - fries.  The $15 burger was pretty lame - 2 slices of bacon that wasn't crisped enough and weren't thick enough and a slice of cheese on a thick greasy patty.  The meat actually had seasoning in it but damn, this is their namesake burger and it was all brown and gray.  Except for the patty - that was pretty red in the middle (they didn't ask..).  No pickle, tomato, onion, or lettuce.\n\nWe were so disappointed in the food, we will probably not feel adventurous for a while!
591	1	a	Let me start by saying I work as a hairstylist and the amount of towels and drapes that a salon goes through in a day is mind blowing, so imagine the horror when your washing machine starts leaking and it's out of commission.  We called Phillips Plumbing and Gary and his crew were there within the hour.  They were beyond friendly and you know they were competent and honest.  They had the problem fixed in a hurry and got us back to running order quickly.  \n\nI HIGHLY recommend this company!!

593	1	a	Thank goodness Jin Caldwell didn't go to medical school as her parents originally wanted her to, but instead chose culinary school.  With a resum\u00e9 that includes studying at Le Cordon Bleu and stints working for the Bellagio, Wynn, and Mars (Ethel M.)  Las Vegas is lucky to have  Ms. Caldwell's very own JinJu Chocolates, a definite treasure located downtown.\n     Customers are greeted by the heavenly aroma of chocolate upon entering the small shop on the second floor of Container Park.  With an array of choices, there is surely something to please everyone even if you aren't a chocolate lover, per se:  from truffles, sea salted caramels, toffee, and chocolate covered almonds to peanut butter cups, chocolate covered Gummy worms, Twinkies, and pretzels.  Ms. Caldwell also bakes and her brownies are fabulous.  One of my favorite chocolates are the Fortunato No. 4 Honey Comb Pearls which look and taste like little chocolate honey combs.\n     With the holidays right around the corner, I highly recommend the $20 Chocolate Emergency kit as the perfect gift.  A real bargain, one box offers the best of JinJu at a steal.  You can follow JinJu Chocolates on Facebook as well as order online and deliver a bit of Las Vegas' best chocolate to your loved ones.
594	1	a	she does awsome nail arts, just show the picture of the design you want, she will tell you if she can do the exactly same or not, very reasonable price and profesional skills! def recommands her!
595	1	a	Very caring staff. Meds were cheaper than taking script to a pharmacy. Just opened so the wait was short.
596	0	a	"Want the absolute worst waxing experience ever? Go here. Seriously, I've NEVER had an experience like the one I had a few weeks ago.\n\nI went in on a Sunday morning and from the very first moment was barraged with three different people trying to get me to 1) realize I need to wax every three weeks or else and 2) should be signing up for a waxing package immediately. So I was already pretty turned off before I even got in the waxing room.\n\nBut then the real \""fun\"" started. I had a girl who was so unprofessional, I was surprised she was even hired. She kept complaining about her hands sweating in her gloves, and wondered why that was happening. She also couldn't rip the wax strips off and kept talking about how she didn't know how to rip them properly. (Which didn't make me feel great as I was worried she would hurt me.) She had no idea how to even spread the wax on properly, so then I was scared it would be left on and burning me.\n\nShe took OVER AN HOUR to do a bikini wax. I've had a lot of waxes in the past, and they've never lasted more than 30 minutes. NEVER. \n\nNow, to be fair, they were in their final stages of opening and were still training their associates. But this was ONE DAY before they opened. Wouldn't that person have needed to go through more extensive training if they were going to be open for business the very next day? Not really instilling confidence from me in this establishment's ability to please customers.\n\nI will definitely not be returning here. I have never been so angry or turned off upon leaving an appointment."
597	1	a	Laura was my wax technician and she was fabulous.  Today was my second time coming to this location and I wasn't that impressed with my technician on the first day-she seemed a little amateur. However, I bought a package and so I was obligated to go back a second time. Laura was my technician the second time around and she was FANTASTIC. My Brazilian barely hurt at all, and she was very professional and easy to talk to. She also let me know of upcoming specials. Go see Laura.
598	0	a	I love this chain.   Not this store.    2 people staffed on a Saturday during lunch isn't enough. \nThe staff was more interested in arguing about how to charge me for my sandwich than making it.\n\nKept pushing me to have my sandwich Mike's Way.   My name is not Mike and I want it my way.  \n\nHere is a hint.   Use only enough oil to make the sandwich moist.   I am not trying to lube a car.  \n\nTrain the staff better and teach them some manners please.
599	0	a	I love jersey mikes but today this place had brown lettuce and very poorly trained staff....avoid this one
600	1	a	Came in today, and i haven't been to a jersey Mike's in forever. Had a terrible customer service experience at a car dealership before getting lunch, the staff here was super friendly and helped turn my mood around. They even gave a free cookie.
601	1	a	I couldn't be happier with my experience. I've had horrific dental care elsewhere that now gives me serious dental anxiety, and Dr. Jacobsen and his staff took extra good care of me to make sure I was well cared for and comfortable. I absolutely recommend Starfire Dental.
602	1	a	Went there by chance and loved it! Great pizza, great price. Service was on point and the patio is large. Loved that you can put what you want on the pizza with no worries about price.
603	1	a	This place opened earlier this month and it's already become one of our regulars. The pizza is delicious and the staff is incredibly friendly and helpful. Super impressed and excited to go back and try the lemonade another reviewer raved about!
604	1	a	Awesome pizza,  excellent service, and fast!!!!! Staff is very courteous and greet you when you walk in. MOD pizza and a soft drink just over $11 and they offer a public service discount ( military, police,  fire fighter)
605	1	a	This place has seriously good pizza, awesome atmosphere and great customer service. Thoroughly impressed for a gourmet fast pizza experience. Also, balsamic. Fig. Glaze...sooooooo good! :)
606	1	a	Walked in, and they greeted us at the door. The person at the counter was trying to explain how it worked, not very well but we can read, so it wasn't hard to figure out. Putting the pizza together was slow and disorganized. We got there right before the lunch crowd and I'm glad because I wouldn't want to wait in that line as they fumbled around trying to put the pizzas together. That being said, the food was great and priced well. I put the slow line/assembly as they have only been open a week and it should be better. You can tell they were all new people. It would have been 5 stars if that was fixed. Seating was also not that great, but ohh well. \n\nHad a chicken, ham, mushroom, olive, tomato pizza and my lady had mushroom and ham. Crust was thin and crispy. Cheese was good, toppings were good. Next time I will do something a bit weird like a siracha chicken or something like that.
607	1	a	Food is amazing and the service is top notch! It nice to come to a restaurant were the people actually serve you with a smile!!
608	1	a	THE CHIPOTLE OF PIZZA! Love this place. Originally all over Seattle Washington and now in the desert!
609	1	a	Good pizza plus good prices and good tasting, it is a little confusing if it's your first time..it's like a subway for pizza..don't recommend  the garlic strips (pizza dough with a crap ton of garlic on top)
610	1	a	Walked in here knowing it was a BYOPizza place but not much else. The place is pretty cool, priced low / inexpensive, tons of topping options, quick service, a couple wines and beers on draft. Great lunch spot. The shopping complex gets crazy busy most days, try to go on a Sunday when everyone else in the neighborhood is at church ;). 4/5 stars because the music was a little too loud (loved the music selection, just needs to be turned down so you can at least hear them call your name when your pizza is ready.
611	1	a	Excellent pizza, great concept. Brian came to check on us to see how everything was and while he was standing nearby, my sister announced she is expecting. We were all ecstatic for her, of course, including Brian. He brought free milkshakes to my sister, myself and my sister-in-law (we're all expecting) and gave us vouchers for free pizza. Great customer service, great place to eat. Looking forward to going back.
612	1	a	LOVE this place! My favorite quick and inexpensive pizza place around. Such a fun atmosphere, family friendly, and they are always so good to my 2 yr old son. I've been when its very busy and when its not so busy, they are always fast. Especially since they have to cook so many one by one. I LOVE that you can put as many toppings on as you want, and nothing costs extra. Very good prices. Awesome place, you must try it!
613	1	a	"SO GOOD!\n\nFirst time here, and it is so good! The best way to describe MOD Pizza is a fancy Subway, but pizza. You make your own pizza to your liking. Personal size pizza with any toppings you want?! Who wouldn't want that! Even though it is so packed the staff was still very nice.\n\nThe only downer is that the seating is horrible. The seating inside was \""family style\"" seating, or you were on a stool looking out a window, not too bad, but is was so busy you couldn't hear anything. The outside seating is really large, but the tables are all ready falling apart. The table we sat at needs to be in the trash it was wobbling all over the place.\n\nWe can't wait to go back... for carryout! Maybe we will try their fancy salads next time!"
614	1	a	"I'll be going back for my third time in 3 weeks tonight. I live close by and decided to take my 5 year old to it for a \""date\"" night. The plaza, like others have said, is busy and parking can kind of be tricky. They honestly could use some more space because it has been packed every time I have been there (Friday and Saturday nights). The line moves relatively quickly, about the same as a Chipotle. \nThe food itself is pretty dang good. With your own choice of unlimited toppings, the type of pizza is truly up to you. The crust is thin and they don't go overboard on the sauce. I have a 2 and 5 year old who both loved it, maybe it was the promise of free milkshakes if they behaved (which yes they got thanks to \""magic\""). While I know the free milkshakes are most likely limited and just trying to promote families to come back, it worked!"
615	1	a	Went to Mod Pizza for the first time tonight with my son. We are both very picky about pizza so I wasn't expecting much. I am glad to say it was delicious!  Even my son loved it. All the toppings you want ant no extra charge was a plus, and love that they make it right in front of you. It only took about 5 minutes for them to cook and they were so tasty. They also have parmesian,  red pepper,  and oregano shakers at the tables, which was nice. Seating was a little awkward but not enough to keep us from eating there. Will definitely return :-)
616	1	a	AWESOME. One of the best pizzas I've had in a while. One flat price per pizza size, get the toppings you want. Great taste, cooked in a brick oven, great atmosphere, great service.
617	1	a	I first saw the concept for this type of pizza place in San Diego called project pie. Mod pizza is pretty close but if they really worked hard and used really high quality ingredients and better soda selection, they'd be 5 stars just like project pie (see my review from earlier this year). Still, mod pizza is pretty good, and I'll probably be a regular.
618	1	a	While pregnant I gained 50 lbs!..I was so embarrassed of the weight I had gained that I told myself I refuse to use my pregnancy as an excuse!..I've been working with meek bleek for awhile now and have since then lost 45 lbs!..I love his work outs and motivation!..I totally recommend this guy as he is genuine in his concern of getting you to where you want to be!..I couldn't ask for a better trainer!
619	1	a	Josh Bleeker is as legit as can be!  Meek Bleek is an amazing system with all kinds of innovative and exciting options.  I would highly recommend anyone who is serious about reaching and exceeding their personal fitness and health goals!
620	1	a	Went here for breakfast with the family. I love their breakfast options, they have everything from huevos rancheros, to breakfast burritos, to pancakes! The breakfast burrito with asada was really good, and my daughter was able to get french toast. The chips and salsa were also good. The chilaquiles weren't actually my favorite, too much sauce, not enough egg, but overall I'd say it was decent. \n\nThe decor is cute, very bright and colorful. Our waitress was very friendly and sweet. The location in my opinion isn't the best place to get a lot of business, you'd never see it from the street, but maybe if they advertise more it can become more popular. My only complaint was the amount of time it took to get our food. There were maybe 4  or 5 other groups eating when we were there and we waited a good 20 minutes to get our food.
621	1	a	I have been here three times.  I went twice for food and once for drinks during happy hour.  Their happy hour prices are not that great, but I think the food and drinks are pretty good.  The atmosphere inside the restaurant is also nice and cheery.  I really like the ranchero salad with shrimp.
622	1	a	Very authentic Mexican food!!! I love the pozole. Best place to cure a hangover with the menudo or pozole
623	1	a	I'm back. I love this place. That is all.
624	1	a	This place was very good. Took a random suggestion, but the service was so friendly and the food delicious. Nachos very yummy
625	1	a	WOW! All i can say, came for my birthday and they truly went above and beyond. The cheesecake was the best I have ever had in the city and the layout was truly amazing! WILL BE BACK VERY SOON
626	0	a	Though the place just opened on 7-14-14 I had a horrible experience here. Waited 45 minutes for my food. Received no napkins, silverware or refills on drinks. The waitress only came to our table on three occasions. When I went to appeal my case, I was still asked to pay for my meal. \n\nWe had to walk over to the waiters area to obtain our own chopsticks, napkins and straws. One of the worst places I've been to in the Charlotte area.
627	1	a	"So to start with I think this review should be 4.5 stars but I can't select that so going with 4 stars. \n\nNow that we have that out of the way let's talk food. I was hungry so I decided to splurge or pig out - whatever you prefer. I got a \""small\"" pho with chicken and the pork sandwich. First of all I got it to go and I wouldn't say that was a mistake just makes it a little harder to eat the pho. They did a great job however of packaging everything so that I could eat at my desk.\n\nFirst off the sandwich was huge and only like $4.50. They could sell them for $6.95 easily. The bread was perhaps the best I've had in Charlotte - think Amalie's style baguette - but better. Yes I'm serious. I mean this was like small village restaurant in France good. Now the pork - wow. Thin sliced ham - again similar to what you might get in France. And then it has other interesting ingredients packed in like thin sliced jalape\u00f1os. Super tasty and what a deal. \n\nSo now I have this huge container of soup to deal with. Not a problem. Noodles were perfect and chicken was tasty. Added a little sriracha sauce and it was perfect. One other review said the broth seemed slightly sweet and I detected that as well but it wasn't overwhelming and I thought it added to the flavor. \n\nSo if you are looking for something a little different for lunch give them a shot. They also have a decent dining area so feel fee to eat in as well."
628	1	a	Walked in with no expectations, left very impressed with the quality, amount of food and service. I ordered the Summer Rolls and the combination Pho. The rolls  were quite filling and delicious, but the pho was even better. The 'small' pho I ordered was more than enough to fill me up for lunch. The side  ingredients (bean sprouts, jalape\u00f1os, mint, red chili sauce) were excellent editions to the pho. All for about 10$.\n\nGo here, it's easily one of the best asian lunch spots in uptown.
629	1	a	Located in the outside portion of the Latta Arcade. \n\nI have no idea what a Vietnamese sandwich and soup is supposed to taste like, but what I had here was freakin delicious!\n\nI had no idea what to expect at all. I ordered the chicken sandwich and chicken soup as a carry out. Paid $12 and it was enough to split for two days lunch. Since I went after 1p the wait wasn't long at all.\n\nBy the time I arrived at my desk I realized that my sandwich was pork and not chicken. I'm hungry and not so inclined to walk all the way back to correct their mistake. \n\nDespite the mistake I enjoyed eating that pork sandwich. The pork was flavorful and tender. The French bread was crusty and buttery outside and soft inside. Filled was freshly cut carrots and cucumbers with a spread of p\u00e2t\u00e9. I'm not a fan of p\u00e2t\u00e9, but it was a really good sandwich.\n\nEverything tasted very fresh. Loved the low prices for a large amount of food. I'm glad to have found a place for a healthy broth soup during the cold season. I will be back.
630	1	a	If you're reading this review right now, and Pho Plus is open, drop what you're doing, quit your job, divorce your husband/wife, and walk -- no, RUN there as fast as you can to go get their pork Bahn Mi sandwich.  The rest of the menu is essentially irrelevant.  Those sandwiches is so damn good.
631	1	a	I love this place. Cheap, delicious, and I can order it and go enjoy a beer somewhere else in brevard court. I have had the beef pho and the banh mi. Both fantastic. The broth is very tasty and the portions are huge. Great bang for your buck. I will continue to frequent this pho gem.\n\nI've never sat down and eaten at this place but the to-go service has been nice and a little slow. But slow is a small price to pay for a cheap delicious meal.
632	1	a	Good pho for cheap in downtown, what else do you need?  Well, service was a little off, but honestly, I don't know if they should even have servers.  I could just as easily buy my drinks at the counter and bus my own table.\n\nI'm not going to tell you its amazing, because it isn't.  At $6.75 a small bowl and $8.50 a large bowl though, who cares.  I'm not sure if there is a better deal downtown.  The small should be plenty enough for most people's lunch.  Of course I had to go big though.\n\nAll the basic accoutrements, fresh basil, extremely crispy bean sprouts, and some sliced jalapeno came out quickly.  Something to snack on while you wait I guess.  It only took 5 minutes for the pho though.  I liked it more than Pho Real, but not quite up there with Ben Thahn, Vietnam Grille, and the like.  It just didn't have quite the depth of flavor.  That said, no complaints on the food.  I did spend some time without water and they weren't even very busy.\n\nBottom line is, I will tell every living soul that I know downtown about this place while its cold out.  People need to know.
633	1	a	This place definitely hits the spot for lunch if you are in the mood for pho, a tasty sammich, or something with rice.  It's located behind the Latta Arcade in Brevard Court so already a win-win location.  There is so much history in the buildings and a very cool part of Uptown to be in.\n\nI first tried this place on a rainy-cold day and the P1 combination did not disappoint.  I've been back a couple times and have tried their appetizers... spring rolls are pretty awesome, but the summer rolls are too if you are looking for a refreshing, non-fried alternative.  Their sandwiches are definitely tasty and fairly priced for the yumminess that you get.  You can't really beat a huge bowl of pho tho... I just love using the spoon in my left hand and chopsticks in my right hand and attacking a great tasting dish for lunch.\n\nThis place recently added booths! They used to just have all round tables, but I think the booths they built are nice and provide a bit of privacy with high backs if you are having a lunch date... or like me, reading my kindle by myself :(...\n\nHighly recommend the Vietnamese Iced Latte if you are a coffee drinker... watch out if you aren't a sweets person though.  It's a nice treat or after meal/during drink.
634	0	a	Ordered the chicken pho but it came with the regular beef broth. What the pho?!
635	1	a	Went here last night during their soft opening.  They don't have the B.R.I. beers on tap yet.  I believe they go on tap on Nov 29th.  Immediately after walking in the door, I knew we would enjoy this place.  Very bright, with some booths, and a few long tables which can be shared among different parties, or used for a big party and a great bar. The craft beer selection is spot on.  From AZ local taps, to upcoming west coast breweries, and some craft classics.  \n\nAs if the beer selection isn't enough, the food was amazing.  Not old school beer pub food, but well thought out and prepared meals.  We had the pulled pork sandwich w/fries, and an order of green chile mac n' cheese.  We were both really pleased with our meal, and that mac n' cheese was literally the best I've ever had (and I've had a lot).    The rest of the menu looks awesome, and we can't wait to try other dishes.\n\nOn top of all that the wait staff were super friendly and attentive.  Many different people stopped by to see if we needed anything.  We also had a chance to meet the co-owner Matt who was a great guy and super excited to get his product out there.  Matt even sent me home with a growler, which will be promptly filled when their beers go on tap.  I'm sure their beers will be spot on.  We're really excited to have this place opening in the East Valley.  Can't wait to get back.
636	1	a	My husband and I went in to check this new place out and we were impressed. We sat at the bar and were helped by Jessie and Brandon throughout our visit. They were both very friendly and made sure we never needed anything. \n\nI had the macaroni and cheese (without meat for me) and it was, without a doubt, the best macaroni and cheese I have ever eaten. This is not your boring, run-of-the-mill mac'n'cheese, but instead it has a lot of different flavors and the green chilies give it a nice touch of heat without burning your mouth.\n\nMy husband had the Pub Burger and couldn't stop talking about how good it was afterward. He had never had a burger with an egg on it, but he really liked it and plans to order it again on our next visit.\n\nWe don't drink beer, but that wasn't an issue since the place has a bar and Jessie makes an incredible margarita. Next time we might try the wine as well since they offer that as well.\n\nThis is a great new place and we'll definitely be back because I'm already craving that mac'n'cheese!
637	0	a	Great food and beer but the worst service I have ever experienced. We were asked to move tables 3 times, the waitresses were switched on us 4 times. Took 25 min for our bill to come and the waitress brought us another tables bill. The manager offered to comp everything but we decided to pay and will never come back again.
638	1	a	Stopped in today for the Grand Opening!!.... Had a flight of their three beers...a flight is four, so added a Lost Abbey guest tap.  Ordered (I forget the name) some pulled pork sandwich with jalapeno coleslaw.  It was fine, nothing to write about, but by no means was it bad, it was just fine.  :)  The beer and service were great.  The place is big enough that you don't feel crowded.  I like the set up...well, really everything about the new brewpub....will definitely be back!!
639	0	a	We went there mid day just before Thanksgiving. I can be a bit hard to find, it is right next to the AMC Theater. In fact, the back door is just steps from the entrance area of the the theater. \nIt was before their Grand Opening, so they did not have any of their beers on tap yet. (we went their to try some of their beers) What they did have on tap was an excellent selection. Our bartender was very knowledgeable and friendly. We were going to have lunch as well. My son had one of their sandwiches. It was huge and he said it was very good. I opted for the carne asada tacos. The meat was all gristle. I actually had to spit it out on plate. (ugh) The tacos came with rice and beans. Those came in a small container (the kind used for a side of ranch dressing) the Spanish rice was all dried out and the beans were just a small amount of black beans. We are talking $11 for this meal of two(gristly) tacos. (they did take it off the bill without me asking)\nEverything else was just fine. We went to a movie and decided to return to BRI for a bit. Had another beer then decided to just go to Red Robin on the other side of Stapley for a burger. \nI was excited about a brew pub in Mesa. I live in far east Mesa. I will probably stick with Four Peaks.
640	1	a	"My friend and I stopped by on our way to have sushi next door (@House Modern Sushi) and we tried their \""batch #1\"" (a blonde Belgian) and a vodka cranberry. Both were spectacular. The staff are friendly, and the atmosphere is laid back, Jason was the bomb, and the owner Matt was very nice! I look forward to trying their food in the very near future."
641	0	a	Ok so the beer was good but I expected a larger selection and feel slightly mislead by their name considering they only had about 12 beers. Now when it comes to the food I had the Carne asada tacos for 10.99 thinking it was going to be a taco plate with rice and beans. I did get rice and beans but in tiny sample cups and the tacos reminded me of tacos I could get at any bar for 1.99. It was two tiny street tacos, granted they were tasty made the small portion all the more depressing know how much that just cost me. I won't be eating there again until they come off their hipster high horse and start providing a fair portion for the cost of the food they serve. Just gotta say the server was nice and attentive
642	1	a	Local craft beer at its peak right here.  These folks know how to do it right.  Enjoyed my sampler of beers in little chemistry beakers, then opted for the Batch #1 which I thought was best.  I was treated to very attentive and friendly service, reasonable prices, and an overall neighborhood sort of feel that I found most attractive.  This is my new favorite local brewpub.
643	1	a	Had the green chili mac n cheese with carnitas and it was Amazing! I like my food a little spicy and it lacked spice but overall was great. after adding some hot sauce, it was perfect. Perhaps adding a sharper cheese and more chili would have been good?\nMy boyfriend had the Cubano sandwich which he loved but he thought the portion size was a little small. \nThe beer was great! Really good beer selection\n\nThe gentleman we had waiting our table was great. He was very friendly and helpful.\n\nOne downside was the organization level seemed to be on the lower side (I'm attributing this to being that they are still new). It did take awhile to get our waiter. There seemed to be a lack of flow, and dead space in the front of the restaurant.  \n\nOverall the restaurant was good and I think the place has potential to be a favorite and staple in Arizona.
644	0	a	I found this place on yelp and I'm always up for trying new breweries but ended up being disappointed. \n\nFor entrees I ordered the green chili Mac and cheese and added machata to it. Which is a shredded typed of beef. It was a bit spicy but good. My boyfriend ordered the carne asada tacos and these were extremely disappointing for $11. The two tacos were only a little bigger than mini tacos. It came with rice and beans that came in those sauce cups that you use to put your salsa in. That's it? \n\nFor beer I ordered their Christmas ale. It tasted really good in the beginning but I'm a slow drinker. After a while it got really flat and tasted really bitter. I was disappointed that they had such a small selection of beers for a brewery. The only plus for me was our waiter was very friendly and knowledgable of their beers.
645	0	a	I hate having to write reviews like this but my experience here was sub-par.\n\nTo start with I got their Vanilla Porter which while ok was nothing special and nothing distinctive about it. I paired that with an order of the machaca tacos ignoring the advice of my buddy to get the mac and cheese. For an $11 dollar taco plate I was expecting more than the 2 barely filled tacos with condiment cups of rice and beans (that weren't particularly hot either). The flavor was actually fairly bland and underwhelming and not filling. This was basically 2 street tacos and tiny sides for $11, it should be a $7-8 plate not one of the most expensive things on the menu.\n\nHowever the worst was yet to come. About 20 minutes after I ate as I was driving home I became very very queezy and nauseous, enough that I rolled down the window in 50 degree temps for fresh air. I rushed home and let's just say I got home just in time. I have never had something like that happen before. It was over pretty quick but was still another 7-8 hours before I was able to eat again. I know food poising usually takes a bit but the sudden onset and the fact I hadn't eaten in 12+ hours (and the last meal was something I have all the time) makes believe something was amiss with the tacos.\n\nBased on the fact my buddies enjoyed their meals and I have heard good things from other I will probably come back and try here again but I will be avoiding the tacos.
646	1	a	A friend and I had the pleasure of visiting BRI today for the first time and walked away EXTREMELY satisfied and welcomed. We met one of the owners (Matt) outside and exchanged pleasantries and then we walked in and immediately greeted by the bar tender (Rose) and she made sure we never ran out of beer. We split the green chili pork poutine fries and pulled pork sliders. They were both delicious! We tried all BRI beers on tap and had their 480G, Batch #1, and Farmhouse Saison. My favorite today was the Farmhouse. All in all it was a good visit and will be back, especially because I live within a mile and this is a great biking destination on any given day!
647	0	a	"Unless I was being pressured to see a chick flick next door at AMC and needed a beer before doing so,  I'd pass.  Brews were so-so (we tasted and opted for guest taps).  \n\n  We were discussing the pretzel bites, which magically showed up at our table.  We were all confused as to the miscommunication that led to them being ordered,  so I had one... Terrible.  Just then the server came by and said it was a mistake, to which we answered that we'd thought she'd overheard us discussing them.  We sent them back.  The bill came and pretzel bites were on there.  The server asked if everything was OK as she picked up the credit cards,  to which I answered everything except the pretzel bites we didn't order or eat...  The response was \""Uhhhhhhh,  ok.\"",  bill was returned with charge still there and she went on to other tables. Not worth the time to dispute.  Don't know if the staff is new to the hospitality biz or what. \n\n  Disappointment for sure."
648	0	a	WHY THE BEER RESEARCH INSTITUTE IS ONE OF THE WORST BREW PUBS I HAVE EVER BEEN TO and why I will not be back spending my hard earn money any time soon.\n\nReason 1:  The first time I went to BRI my wife and I were ignored when we first arrived.  After we had ordered food, my wife and I sat around for over 45 minutes waiting on our dishes.  I let this first encounter slide since BRI had just newly opened, and I like to give people second chances.\n\nReason 2:  The second time I visited BRI with my two adult daughters.  Their own impression of the place was the wait staff was terrible, but the drinks and food were good.  They stated that they would probably not go back because the wait staff con out weighted the food/drink pro.  The also stated that the bar did not have an atmosphere that made them (young females) feel comfortable.\n\nReason 3:  I was refused a BRI growler the third time I went.  I drove over 6 miles to try and support this local brewery, but they told me they were unwilling to give me a growler of their craft beer since they were running low on their own beer.  The owner, Matt, said that I could stay there and drink a pint of their craft beer or receive a discount on a guest tap growler.  It was so frustrating for me because I have a professional license and cannot drink and drive since my license could be taken away by the state of Arizona.  I told Matt this, but he still refused.  The worst part of the third visit?  There were only 3 or 4 people in the bar.\n\nOverall:\nPros: great food, decent beers\nCons:  TERRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE
649	0	a	The staff at the counter was nice and the food was mediocre. The main thing that killed the entire experience was that we arrived at 8pm (their hours are 6am to 9pm) and by 8:20, when we went for a refill, they had shut the entire soda machine down and were stacking chairs. When we wanted a refill they had to actually put they nozzles back on the soda machine to allow us to get a refill.\n\nI think you need to at least stay open the hours posted on your door, and not rush the people who just paid to eat at your restaurant out the door. We were the only people eating when we went, and although the server was friendly, you need to stay open the hours you say you will. No one wants to eat while the place is being shut down. If you want to close early, you need to say so.
650	0	a	So Opa Life has taken over the space formally occupied by My Big Fat Greek Express as apparently the parent company of Opa Life bought out MBFGE per my conversation with the woman working the counter who is apparently from corporate helping launch the store.\n\nThe first thing I noticed here was that they did a really nice job renovating the old space that was dingy and tired space. This is nice and refreshing.\n\nSadly the second thing I noticed was the sticker shock of this place compared to MBFGE which was pretty reasonable. I think they are up a couple bucks up across the board.\n\nI got the special which was a combo deal of chicken pita, drink and a side for $9. The food was fine but lacking flavor. The flavors were pretty blank on the pita it was pretty much red onion and taziki for taste the chicken was band and over cooked.\n\nThey just opened so I will give them a bit and try again and see if it's any different but with Pita Shack closer to me and I think a bit more flavor it will be hard to convince myself to come this way often.
651	0	a	Went here with my wife to try it out despite hearing that it was a flop - But I thought to myself i should give the place a chance, especially since we order catering for almost hundred people in our company every week and I'm in charge of picking vendors. I thought good Mediterranean that's inexpensive could be a good option.  NOT!  Here is a quick summary:  \n\n(1) While we were in line, my wife observed a sloppy looking chef stuffing his face with meat then licking his fingers.  REALLY?  No gloves?  Several customers noticed and one walked right out in disgust.\n\n(2) I would rather be a snob than sit through another sub-mediocre dry Gyro and over salted sides (rice). \n\nIt would be far stretched to say I had food poisoning, let's just say my tummy wasn't too happy after. \n\nThe service was good other than the chef but the food is a no go for me. AVOID!
652	1	a	At first I thought the meal would be slightly overpriced until the food actually arrived--I had the Chicken Caesar Wrap--and it was huge (& delicious) plus it came with a healthy & fresh-tasting side salad. I also wish the tea wasn't behind the counter, but whatevs--I enjoyed eating there and will definitely be back (& am looking forward to my leftovers!)\nAlso, I had the half Baklava... was so good I might go back sometimes for that dessert alone!!
653	0	a	1st time was great service. Husband of the owner was super nice and the experienced barista was sweet as well. Prices were pretty outrageous for a place you walk up and order from but the great service and food brought us back.\n\n2nd time the service was poor. The lady seemed to be hating life and didn't offer a single smile or pleasantry. I paid 14 bucks for a plate of chicken, rice, veggies and a pita which I wouldn't mind if it were a sit-down-and-get-served restaurant but you walk up and order and then they call your name (or bring it to you if they aren't too busy). \n\nBottom line: Good food and nice atmosphere but won't be back due to prices and unfriendly service. I would be willing to return if my plate were 8 bucks instead of 14.
654	0	a	I thought we would go check this place out since its so close to me and use to eat at the previous business located there. I thought first there was a bit of an identity issue with what this place wants to be..But didn't bother me.. The problems were..They got one of our orders wrong, redid it. We got basically the same thing from when it was the previous business..it wasn't as good..and sadly priced higher. Also, overheard one of the employees complain to the another about the amount of hours the staff are having to work. AND LASTLY, we were the only people in there with half the time made up of the ladies at the front just looking over at us..Awkward
655	1	a	Beautiful atmosphere & AMAZING food. I would recommend Opa any day. Definitely becoming a regular at this place.
656	0	a	I miss the greek express this place is nice but no worth the 4.00 more charge. Very nice remodel, but gone is the friendly service this place has an identity problem it wants to be a restaurant, but with all the TV's is trying to be a sports bar which it is not and will never will be. I will not be going back.
657	1	a	We tried for dinner, & enjoyed. Even our picky eater LOVED the chicken souvlaki. Today, we tried breakfast. Very tasty strawberry smoothie, based on how fast my child sacked it down. :-P I did manage to get a taste, & it was nice & refreshing. I tried the bacon paninni w/ bacon, egg, spinach, sun-dried Tomatoes. YUM! \n\nI noticed one review commented on tea setup. That is now fixed & available for self serve.
658	1	a	As I was eating I was surprised at the relatively low star count. My food was delicious and promptly served and the wait staff was kind enough to answer all my questions. They also serve six beers on tap, coffees and desserts. I also would like to try some of their new breakfast menu! We will definitely be back!!
659	0	a	Loving Greek food as much as I do I returned to give this new venue a second shot.  While the environment is GREAT for working, free wifi music (80's Rock that day) and spacious, the food doesn't cut it.  I ordered a basic greek salad, my friend a gyros and we had a hummus appetizer.  \n\nThe first hummus tasted spoiled, the kind when you put it in your mouth it fizzes.  I eat hummus almost daily and I'm hard to please but fresh is key.  They did replace it with no hassle but it didn't start things well.\n\nFor the high prices it was a lackluster salad,  lettuce unassuming, unripe tomatoes and dressing that tasted like it was from a bottle.  For the price I expected a much higher quality salad, not a cheap diner salad.  The gyros plate was just as unimpressive.\n\nSecond visit the staff was pretty and either brand new and didn't know anything or not well trained.  We got what we needed but service could overlook the high prices and so-so quality.  \n\nI'm vegan so I can't eat much else, but if you want a quick meal, a place to work it's good.  And they just opened so much of this may work out!!  I will have to be REALLY hungry to go again but would have a meeting here.
660	0	a	They had a guy on the corner advertising breakfast I love this place for lunch but was really disappointed when I walked in with only one person working and 4 people I. Line and several people waiting for food needless to say I turned around and left. If your trying to build business you should be staffed to do so
661	1	a	ordered 4 gyro pitas, 3 greek fries, spanakopita and hummus platter to go. their tsatsiki sauce is the bomb.com.  the owner is so nice and always remembers us.  the foid is good but even if it was mediocre i would come back for that charm!  4 visits now and so far so good
662	0	a	"If you want KRAFT MACARONI AND CHEESE  at a restaurant, this is the place to go!! Decided to get a quick meal for my child and macaroni cheese was the only selection for any pasta type dish on the kid's menu. And with a only a few sides to choose from as an option I reluctantly chose fries. When the food came out, what appeared before me was boxed macaroni on my plate! I was in disbelief. I asked the server, \""Is that Kraft macaroni that they made?\"" To which the girl replied,  \""Yeah...well. ..that's how most restaurants make it.\"" That made me even more irritated, that she would go as far to say that MOST restaurants use store bought macaroni, as if I was that ignorant! Not to mention, the fries were your standard Ore-ida frozen steak fries. I thought this place was going be authentic and fresh; I was sorely disappointed. I think I was even being on the nice side saying it was Kraft, for all I know it was store brand macaroni. I'm sure this is indicative of how they prepare the rest of their menu, with premade, frozen, out-of-the-box food."
663	0	a	The place is pretty and located on an attractive venue, but the food and service were subpar.  I ordered a 24 oz tea and a sliced gyro.  The clerk asked me if I was sure I needed two cups (as I was clearly by myself) since the tea had free refills. Confused, I said that I only needed one glass.  Worse still, she ordered me a plate of gyro meat instead of a gyro, and had the audacity to lecture me on the appropriate way to order next time.  My food was cold.  There will not be a next time
664	0	a	Nope
665	1	a	This place is wonderful. Not only did they accommodate my post-breakfast, breakfast order, but they did it with genuine friendliness.\n\nEvery person I encountered here was pleasant and friendly. The store is clean, there's a large variety of options and the food is great.\n\nI hope they will open locations in the other airports I frequent!
666	1	a	Great sandwiches and soup... Courteous staff.. Perfect spot for a quick snack in between flights
667	1	a	Usually food at the airport is sad. For breakfast, the chipotle egg sandwich here was very tasty!! It was hot and satisfying. If you're in terminal 4, check it out!
668	0	a	I'm going to be honest. Most of the boxers in this gym are practicing bad habits and in time will become terrible boxers.\n\nHe does one combo the upper upper Lower lower and he lets his members throw punches wrong. If you don't believe me follow his Facebook page he posts videos of his members boxing and it frustrates me knowing the punches are wrong.\n\nFirst mistake is a heavyweight shouldn't be training people 150lbs lighter than him.\n\nHe owes me a months membership. And is not true to his word and very unprofessional but since the gym is so bad idc much about a months membership cause I'm never going back.\n\nHe spends more time uploading videos than focusing on boxing. \n\nIf the current members truly believe he's a good coach then good luck I hope you never actually fight in a ring and since I love this sport I advice people who have a passion for boxing to look elsewhere.
669	1	a	So I've been going to Big Cat Boxing since they opened. I normally train at multiple gyms and the main reason why I continue to come back to BKB is because of the family atmosphere. \n\nFor many people who have never boxed before, the thought of walking in to a boxing gym can be intimidating. BKB is not one of those gyms. Everyone who walks in through the doors of Big Cat Boxing are welcomed with open arms.\n\nYour fitness goal are assessed and you are pushed to you limits as every class is a test of your endurance and physical ability. Big Cat's Bully Proof Boxing for the kids is amazing! The basis of this class is designed to teach kids the power of discipline, hard work, teamwork and integrity. It's all about playing Win-Win at BKB. I don't win unless we ALL win. That teamwork mentality creates an atmosphere of family and togetherness. \n\nYou can talk all day about bad technique, but to be quite honest, everyone starts somewhere and I've seen students of BKB go from overweight down in the dumps with bad form and low self-esteem to eliminating incredible amounts of weight, gaining confidence and great technique. \n\nWhat sets BKB apart from the rest is it takes the sport of boxing normally known as a violent intimidating sport and turns it in to a fun way to get in shape with your family. It may not be for everyone, but I would recommend BKB any day for my friends and family looking to get in shape.
670	0	a	Ordered the #1 right before close: mustard, chili, cheese, and onions.\nDog was out quick, service was friendly, but product was sub-par: small dog looked boiled and old, not at all visually appealing. \nTaste did not seem to include any mustard per the order board, but the chili was actually really good. Onions were weird, almost shredded to death instead of chopped. Bun fell apart halfway through eating.\nThis isn't the best food court I've come across, but there are better options here instead of this joint.
671	1	a	First off let me say the owner is super, super nice. She is passionate about what she does and it comes across in her food! Coney Island was at the Meadows Mall but the owner informed us that they recently moved. Wishing them success because the food is definitely enough to keep me going back! Oh her chili is awesome!
672	0	a	Hotdog was green and tasted spoiled.  Kinish was soggy.   Why prepare the hot dog in a toaster oven?\n\nTried to return it and the person told me no refunds. So I was out $8.  I even told the person I was going to post a negative review on Yelp.  Didn't phase him at all.  \n\nI wound up buying a second lunch at the Chinese gourmet express next door which was better.\n\nThe whole way this was prepared was gruesome..\n\nAvoid.   Consider yourself warned.
673	1	a	Visited this store for the first time last week and Im hooked!  Very attractive and nicely laid out with a wide variety of merchandise at fair prices.  My only complaint is that they wrap your purchases in used newspaper instead of the plain wrapping paper all the other antique stores use and when I got my vase home I had to wash it to get the black newsprint off of it.  That's something I expect when I shop at Goodwill, not at a nice antique store.  Had to knock off a star for that.  Otherwise, this is a great place to shop.
674	1	a	LOVE the work and the people.... Willy has done great work on me many times.  I  definitely be returning and would recommend to anybody.
675	1	a	I went about a month ago to get my medusa piercing and had a GREAT experience. Friendly staff. Clean shop. Will definitely go back or recommend a friend! Thank you for a safe n great experience
676	0	a	"Was there opening Saturday and the following Tuesday. The worst part about it was being accosted by a gang of teenagers trying to sell their rap album to me. Can't I shop with my children without being pestered to buy your rap album? I politely told a security guard I about the incident and he approached them in his segway and started laughing with them and they proceeded to heckle more shoppers to buy their rap cd. It will be a while until I give this place another chance. \n\nI don't see any real bargins. Example: Guardians of the Galaxy Rocket Raccoon Toy $9.99 at Walmart, Toys \""R Us and Target is $15.99 at the outlet Toy shop. \n\nSak's off Fifth has a decent selection, but nothing too impressive. I'd rather drive over to Nordstrom. \n\nParking system is poorly planned. Mall is not complete so I'll give it a pass here. Hopefully once the surrounding area builds out things will improve. Food court not finished. By the way, Chick fil A should be ashamed of themselves for selling a 8 oz coke for $2.00."
677	1	a	Yay! I don't have to travel to Gaffney!\n\nI was actually there opening weekend ( cray, I know) and I was really satisfied with the selection of shops! It's got all my favs, so I'm sure you'll find me here once all the hype dies down. \n\nKeep in mind, there's room for improvement and I'm sure more stores will pop up here and there! However, it's nice to have an alternative to club ratchet (Concord Mills) that's *actually* an outlet center! Plus, it's super close to my house, all but eliminating my need to travel to Gaffney, Mebane, or Concord Mills (unless I'm on a shopping mission for an epic deal)!\n\nFinally, the shopping gods have smiled upon me! Happy shopping!
678	1	a	I hauled my mother along with me to visit the outlets, arriving at 10 am on a Friday (CMS schools were out, and it was Halloween - I thought this was going to be poor planning on my part, but it turned out okay).  \n\nWith the early arrival time during the work-week, I easily found a parking spot at the end of a row near Old Navy.  Be warned - the parking lot was designed by Helen Keller and there are WAY too many C (compact) parking spots.  Some of the compact cars we saw when leaving were a Navigator, a Sequoia, an Expedition and several full size sedans.  Stop with the damn compact parking.  (I know, I know... I work for an arch firm, parking spot quotas and whatnot, but STAHHHHP).\n\nFood Court is bleh.  And there is nothing really close to the outlets to eat.  Eat before or after, or know that you will need to get a cookie at the cookie joint and a coffee from Starbucks to snack on.  The Starbucks is not it's own store, it's more of an overgrown coffee stand/building in the middle of the walkway.  You're going to be standing in line outside and you have to keep moving.\n\nAs a chubby gal, I was happy to see the Old Navy.  Torrid (the big and tall whore store) is also located here, but everything was black and goth'y (I am fat, but I still like to wear colors).  They had great purse deals at the Kate Spade and Coach, though the folks at the Coach were stalking and I can't stand that.  Greet me when I come in and then leave me alone.  Outer wear was well priced at Eddie Bauer, as was the clearance section.  Yankee Candle had the large jars 4 for $44 (be aware that this is truly the outlet for YC - you typically won't find the same scents that they have in the stores/online, though some were stocked).  I was a little disappointed that the GH Bass store had mostly boots, but 'tis the season.\n\nLike Bruce K. said, if you have ever been to a Simon/Premium Outlet, you know what to expect.  This is very similar to the outlets that I have visited in Charleston in design and retailers.  A nice addition to the Charlotte area, and I will definitely return (at 10 am on Sundays or after the first of the year - I wouldn't come here during the holidays unless forced at gunpoint - it's going to be a shitshow).
679	0	a	Excellent ambience from the decor to the James Brown playing. Service was also great. Great crowd even at 2pm on a Saturday. Both my wife and I thought the menu was a little too abstract. The waitress had to explain - this is a salad, this is a sandwich. We both ordered the burger and it was delicious, although a tad pricey at $14 (and no sides). We ordered a side of some fried veggies and we both found those entirely too salty...couldn't finish the bag. I think they have the makings for a great little restaurant with some menu and price refinements. The other down side is that we left feeling greasy...not sure if it was the fried veggies or the burger. I look forward to trying more menu options and increasing my rating to a 4. \n\nTwo months later...I did return with my parents for breakfast and sadly, we won't be back. The food just isn't hitting the spot and it's entirely over priced. Portion sizes are ridiculously small, bacon is too thick, cinnamon toast was peppered with coarse sugar, coffee bowls are lame...Change the menu and prices and we'll back. We used to go to Fabu on the regular but we can't swing your Manhattan prices.
680	0	a	Cute ambience. Great location.  They got everything right but the food.  The menu is too short with none of your standard breakfast items.  We came hungry and left hungry.  Unfortunately, we won't be returning unless the menu changes.
681	0	a	My wife and I live down the street so we wanted to try it for lunch the first week it opened.  The d\u00e9cor is very interesting and has a warm vibe.  The outdoor seating is pleasant especially with the oversized canopies allowing for ample room for tables + it keeps most of the patrons in the shade and out of the rain.  Service was fine and we were given a good description of the ingredients in the food which is always welcomed.  \n\nWithout getting in to too much detail as far as what we ordered, we found the menu very limited and the food rather bland.  Everything is a la carte and there was no bread service.  Two small al a carte sandwiches, one side and two sodas (in the little bottles - no refill opportunities) totaled $34 after tip and we left hungry.  We certainly did not expect Cheesecake Factory portions but c'mon.  \n\nSince we do live in the neighborhood, no one would love to see Little Spoon thrive more than us, but we won't go back...for now anyway.  The farm to table concept is good but there has to be a balance between the advantages of that versus making a place affordable to eat.  A few suggestions...bread service, a side of chips (something!) with a sandwich and ditch the expensive sodas.  Fantastic they have real sugar versus corn syrup but again, advantages of that versus the price point. \n\nAll the above said, Little Spoon has the potential to be a neighborhood staple (Mellow Mushroom and Nolen pulled it off) if some things are tweaked,  If not, I'm afraid it'll be another flash in the pan because there isn't enough value for what it serves up.
682	0	a	I DONT GET IT. This a la carte culture in the food world is getting ridiculous. More money for less food. It would be one thing if the food was really good, but it's just okay. 10 dollars for a bowl of heirloom tomato wedges?? The server was nice enough and knowledgable, but that's about it. Don't waste your time. \n\nAlso the valet service in that strip mall is terrible. Complementary service? Sure why not! They insisted that I just have them park it so I obliged. Except They pulled up ten minutes after I gave them my ticket because they don't know what they're doing, and it's not that big of a lot. And they pulled up with my girlfriends car with the trunk open. Why? who knows. \n\nSo. 30 dollars for a hamburger, a tomato salad, and a bowl of coffee (just put it in a mug, for goodness sake), plus a 6 dollar tip is 20%, and then a tip for the incompetent valet if you're not a crappy person is over 40 dollars just for lunch. If you're a rich person who needs somewhere to spend your money, go to Little Spoon. If you're just a person who wants good food at a reasonable price (or even someone who doesn't mind paying more for ACTUALLY good food with decent portions), then go somewhere else. \n\nJust finished this review shortly after my meal and I'm already hungry, if that gives you an idea.
683	0	a	"Showed up at 1:45 on a Sunday (they close at 3pm) and was turned away by the hostess with a poorly explained \""we're not seating any more for the rest of the day\"" -- something to the effect of them taking a lot of reservations and being unable to accommodate walk-ins. The restaurant was half-empty. I guess their spoons are even smaller than they advertise."
684	0	a	We couldn't wait for this restaurant to open! We live just down the street and just knew it would be a new favorite. Not so, unfortunately. The menu is very limited, maybe 5 choices of entrees. Many of them have some heat and I don't like hot/spicy food, so I struggle to find something to eat. Small portions, big prices. Nice, funky decor; a nice outdoor area to eat; and a great neighborhood for shopping, art galleries, a frozen yogurt store. It's a great urban experience. If it just wasn't for the food!
685	0	a	"My vegetarian/vegan friends and I were very disappointed in the lack of options here. You would think as a \""farm to table\"" restaurant there would be more here for us! All I could eat was the granola and it wasn't bad... But was definitely overpriced."
686	0	a	After looking at photos and the menu we were stoked to tryout the unique eats at Little Spoon. The restaurant is located in a quaint spot on Selwyn, next to Mellow Mushroom. \n\nThe menu was limited to a few selections that all sound really great on paper. One interesting item was the cinnamon sugar toast, but for some reason it doesn't have much taste. Maybe it needs more butter. The breakfast sandwich we got was pretty good, but it was very greasy and the bacon was really undercooked. \n\nThe prices are a little bit high here and the environment is kind of cramped for what you get. Reading the menu was the most delicious part.
687	0	a	I went in to check this place out when it had just opened. The music made absolutely no sense with the atmosphere. They were playing hip hop music with cuss words in the songs. (Unprofessional). The meatball was pretty good. Oh but did I mention they have no ketchup? It's a breakfast and brunch lunch whatever kind of restaurant and don't have ketchup?
688	0	a	"Why did I try this place again?! A friend of mine suggested it, and since it had been a few months since my last visit, I thought maybe it had gotten better since then and wanted to give it another chance. While it's not any worse than it was, it's definitely not any better. My impressions of this experience:\n\n--There were only maybe 4 or 5 other tables in the place, yet both times I wanted a refill on my coffee, I had to request one. This was in spite of the fact that our server had been to our table to check on us and must have seen that our cups were empty. He was right on top of taking payment once we finished our food, though.\n\n--The server was nice, however, and made sure to check that over easy eggs on the BEC sandwich were ok for my pregnant friend to eat.\n\n--The coffee was still really good. The coffee and the friendliness were the only really good things about this visit. Everything else was eh.\n\n--The BEC sandwich cost $8 and was about the same size as a Starbucks breakfast sandwich (which costs half as much) but didn't even taste as good. The slab of bacon (which was ham-style, super thick bacon) was greasy and flavorless. The whole thing was just bland and seemed like it needed some kind of sauce or seasoning. While I can appreciate the fact that this is a farm-to-table, sit-down dining experience, I would expect to get something at least as good if not better tasting than what a giant chain coffee shop is offering. \n\n--The menu is still in that weird, hard-to-decipher format. My friend couldn't figure out what to order because they're still just listing ingredients and neglecting preparation/presentation. I sort of knew what to expect, but some of the newer items were totally cryptic.\n\n--\""Liver mush\"" has got to be the most disgusting name for a dish that I've ever heard. It might be good. I wouldn't know, because the name sounded so awful that I didn't dare try it.\n\nLittle Spoon continues to be an okay experience at a premium price. I love the location. I love the space. PLEASE step up the food game and make your menu format more approachable! It baffles me that such good ingredients are being used to prepare such average-tasting items. This place could and should be miles better."
689	1	a	I have dined at Little Spoon twice this week. Pro's-The restaurant feels trendy like a NYC village spot.  The service is quite good and the waiters are very friendly and knowledgeable.  I am pleased that this is a farm to fork and supports local growers. They seem to have classic opening growing pains in that the menu is very limited and both times I was there they were out of items from the very small offering.  The food was very tasty and I am hoping that they will be successful!
690	1	a	The best tamales in town, stop by for a delicious horchata latte expertly crafted and homemade by the owner Jennie, who is super friendly and seriously passionate about her coffee. Located inside Proclaim Church, a family owned business who nows how to make a mean cup of Joe :)
691	1	a	Seriously the best toddy in the phx area... good baked goods too!\nAnd some of the nicest people work there....
692	1	a	Last weekend we did our go to Flip'n Chicken and noticed Chicken Salad Chick in the same shopping center.  We wanted to stop by on Sunday to check it out, but they were closed.\n\nToday we stopped by to get some to go.  We stopped by around 11:30 and had no issues getting the flavors we wanted, and a short wait.\n\nKevin and I both ordered the three sampler, which is surprisingly a lot of chicken salad, we will likely make three or so meals out of it!  Which is a great deal for $8.95.\n\nNow onto the Chicken Salad:\nBuffalo Barclay - very mild but great flavor\nBarbie-Q - slight smokey flavor, good, but not our favorite.\nOlivia's old south (traditional with egg and pickles) - I liked the traditional flavor, bit still not the favorite\nKickin Kay Lynne (buffalo, ranch, bacon, cheese, and jalapenos) - you would think this is a spicy one, but it was also very mild to me.  I didn't taste the bacon or jalapenos so much, it had a similar flavor to the buffalo one.  It had great flavor, probably one of our favorites (good thing we got two scoops of this one!)\nPimento cheese - eh, stick to chicken salad.  It was just okay, almost too thick and lacks any kick (I guess you can't be surprised if the buffalo has no kick)\n\nOverall, great place to get different flavored chicken salad at a good value.  We will be back!
693	1	a	I love chicken salad, so when I heard about this new place I was really excited to try it. A few coworkers & I went to pick it up for lunch and we all really enjoyed it. I got the chicken salad choice that has bacon, ranch & cheddar, it is really yummy. I also love the grape salad. We have gone back several times since & it's become our fav lunch spot. The only down side is, the place is super small, not a lot of tables and it's always crowded so we always take it to go.
694	1	a	1st time here and was very impressed.  I got the Chick Trio, which is a great value. I ordered the Buffalo Barclay and the Fancy Nancy salads and the grape salad. My husband ordered the Kicking Kay Lynne on sourdough with a pasta salad. \n\nChick Trio- great value! You get a decent scoop of salad. Only give you 6 crackers, but I feel if I asked for more they would have no problem. I found there was a slightly lack of seasoning in both. Not a lot of Buffalo flavor and lacking some salt and pepper in the fancy Nancy. Overall good. Since hubby and I both got buffalo we asked for some buffalo sauce and they brought us some extra sauce on the side.The sauce is awesome! Wish they would have added more of it to the salad, but very easy to just add to whatever you are eating. The grape salad is amazing and I very much wanted to lick the cup when I was done.\n\nSandwich- Sourdough bread was wonderful, soft fluffy perfect. Once again once the Buffalo sauce was added it was a perfect sandwich.  Pasta salad was very flavorful and very good. \n\nPortion sizes are great for the price. Service was very quick and responsive.  Overall great place and will be back.
695	1	a	So. Many. Dumplings.\n\nThere are only two things that can stop me from squawking when i'm sick: ramen and dumplings. Don't ask me why, but this combo is my flu ridden happy place. Keep your chicken soup, I want shrimp wrapped in wonton.\n\nI actually found this place while I was looking for another little asian supermarket that Justin G introduced me to. It's also very good. I'll tell you exactly how good whenever I manage to find it again...\n\nBut this place is a happy alternative in the meantime. It's fairly big and decently organized. They have three freezers full of dumplings as soon as you enter and they stock my favourite melt-your-face-off spicy ramen, so I was a fast fan. I grabbed three different types of dumplings to tide me over during sick-a-palooza. Judging by the fact that the Beijing wonton dumplings are already done... it's safe to assume these are damn tasty.\n\nI also grabbed some good miso, dumpling sauce and fancy soy sauce. Because nothing makes me feel like a true blue adult quite like low sodium, brand name soy sauce. It's the little things.\n\nIt's a hop, skip and a jump away from Real Foods, so it's a good destination one-two punch for me. My only complaint is that it's a bit pricey, but they have a handy, dandy check in offer that took some of that sting off. \n\nI figure I have about 35 different dumplings left to try, so yes, i'll definitely be back.
696	1	a	Placed our order and within 5 minutes we were chowing down. Beef Pepper Steak &  Hot Garlic beef. Service was spot on. I would highly recommend this to any sit down and it could top any buffet on the north rest part of the valley.
697	1	a	We used Agape Turf for the installation of artificial grass in our back yard. These guys are awesome. The grass they used was Fescue and it looks like real grass. Everybody that's come over to our house immediately thinks that it's real grass. Even our friends who have fake grass in their yards say that ours is much better quality! That says a lot about Agape's service and quality. Their installers and sales reps are 100% professional and were very easy to work with. If you want to eliminate a bunch of yard maintenance or trying to keep your real grass from dying I highly suggest thinking about artificial grass / turf for your yardand use Agape Turf. They by far have the best grass in Phoenix.
698	1	a	A+++... We found Agape at a home show, and they installed artificial turf, a putting green, and travertine tile in our backyard. We are extremely happy with their work! Excellent, professional contractors and high quality products.  We just went through monsoon season with our new yard and it drains beautifully.  Looks just like new.  We get compliments from everyone... HIGHLY recommend!!!!!
699	0	a	Not a great job and mows with guards up.  Damaged my car and then denied it and started cussing.  Unprofessional and Rude and not very good landscape service.  I to wish they had a 0 star.
700	1	a	Great service, excellent food.  This was formerly Cork, and recently re-opened as Earnest.  I never went to Cork, but may come back here again.  We had three appetizers - lamb meatballs, prosciutto (wasn't on the menu, was a special that night), and mac and cheese.  All three were great.  My wife had the salmon, I had the buffalo brisket, both were great as well.  Good wines too, I definitely recommend visiting here and trying for yourself.
701	1	a	I had heard good things about this restaurant lately (specifically the happy hour) so I decided to give it a try. I was very pleasantly surprised. I had the happy hour burger and onion rings and they couldn't have been better. The burger was juicy, the onion rings were crispy but not over cooked, and the thick cut bacon - holy goodness batman! I also loved the happy hour basil gimlet; so much so, I had two. Moreover, the blonde bartender (I can't remember her name) was wonderful... Fun but professional. I will be recommending this restaurant.
702	0	a	I loved this place when it was Cork.  We went there this week for dinner, and the food & service was sub-par at best.  Our waiter (jack ass) was not familiar with menu,  and could not give my wife or her friend any feedback on the wine list.  The dessert was inedible, and was sent back.  This place was much better when Robert was in charge.  It's clear they are having issues figuring out both the front & back of the house.  There is one thing that I'll guarantee - I will not go back to this place, and that is very disappointing!
703	0	a	Terrible.\n\nEverything from the service on New Years eve to the food choices.\n\nThis place was good when it was Cork and had a great happy hour. As for its New Years dining experience which they charged $75 per person for it was horrible.\n\nHorrible server. The worst Cake ever, everyone at the table sent it back. It was overcooked and dry and tasted like something purchased at a 3day old mexican bakery.\n\nThe fish was the only thing anyone liked to be honest. The short rib dish was horrible and definitely NOT worth the $75 per person price of admission.\n\nNot once did the waiter apologize for anything at all, not even a single dish that was sent back. He looked extremely coked out actually.
704	1	a	Stopped by because I heard they were doing a 50 cent medium coffee special for grand opening. The employees were knowlegeable about the menu, friendly and fast...my drink was out about a minute after I paid which is really awesome if you're in a hurry. \n\nI like how the store is really spacious and there are a handful of comfy arm chairs in addition to table seating. I guess they're trying to make Dunkin' the new place to hang? There's free wi-fi too so you can get some work done while getting some coffee and treats
705	0	a	Perfect example of how you should not run a business. Ordered a large iced Americano on 2 occasions, prices were trickling into the $5.00 range. My total was $4.27 found the .27 cents and offered to get $1.00 back,cashier stated it's done already.\nSticking with my regular place going forward
706	0	a	Don't go there if you want a pleasant experience with the staff.  A bunch iLife kids that could care less about customer satisfaction.
707	0	a	For the price you pay these are some of the most saddest donuts you've ever seen, isn't it. I won't go back to Dunkin Donuts any more- competitors here I come. Even the cashier doesn't even know exactly what the cost of things are very uninformed and not properly trained.
708	0	a	Donuts were not worth the calories.  Sad is what one person posted... Totally right.  The saddest donuts ever .  No taste.  Somewhat mushy and does not have the crispness you would expect.  No competition for their competitors.  Coffee was not robust.  Tasted like cheap coffee... Not like Dunkin Donut original.  Maybe watered down.  Do not bother.  Corporate needs to get in there and fix this place.  Maybe later if you are desperate.
709	0	a	Sunday morning isn't a great day for new employees but I'm chill - first nobody made my coolata while my food got cold :/ 2nd when I finally got it - it was melted even though I had just gotten it\nby the time I came home my sammy was all mushy instead of nice & crisp\nThrew it in the broiler for 2 minutes & it completely burnt up :(\nBut why should I have to come home & cook after spending $ on food?!\nPlus the everything bagel I ordered for the other sammy wasn't everything - plain Jane something  I NEVER would've ordered \nDon't let me spend $30 on shit I don't want!\nShame on you dunkin donuts!\nGoing back to Pink Box!
710	1	a	Wandered around the Shops of Norterra today and found this boba place! I was SO excited that there's a boba place! Not only that, but they sell Snow Fluff. My friend and I shared the 16 oz mango snow fluff with red beans and condensed milk. The fluff was a tad icier than other ones I've tried...and didn't have a strong mango flavor. It'd be awesome if they were a little more generous though. The fluff was $4.95, and each topping is 50 cents. For this price, I can get it somewhere else where it's overflowing! It is pricier than the one place I love in Mesa...but it's in Mesa, so considering the time and money spent driving over to Mesa...I'll take this.\n\nThe ladies working there were nice, and I want to go back ASAP to try their boba and tea. Also, the Avalanche!! It looks delicious, and perfect for a bigger group of people, and perfect for people like me who wants to try a bit of everything.\n\nOh, and a tip, $10 minimum for credit cards.
711	1	a	I had Royal Milk Tea not bad with boba no jelly. It was a little expensive $5.00+ for a small about the size of a grande at Starbucks. Didn't try anything else.
712	1	a	We're visiting from CA where there are plenty of boba and shaved snow cafes. Turns out that this is one of the best shaved snow we have been to. The boba is also excellent. Great location and friendly staff. Price is definitely very reasonable
713	1	a	Love this place! So many options and combos! My whole family loves it! So glad to see a high quality boba establishment in Phoenix, lucky me it is near my work!
714	1	a	Finally have a boba place near my house! This place is really good, as long as you aren't looking for something crazy.  It's hard to find places that use real fruits for boba, so I normally order their royal milk tea.  Their snow fluff is good - just make you verify what you order. Three times now they got my original snow fluff with strawberries on top mixed with strawberry snow fluff
715	1	a	I absolutely love this new little joint. A wonderful selection of whiskey and a high level of attention to crafting cocktails makes for a great experience in this stylish container. In addition to the cocktail list, the bartenders here are willing to play with your tastes and customized a cocktail for you. On our last visit, Pinto created Clyde's Smoked Peach, which my friend and I declared the best cocktail we could remember ever tasting. This place is the bee's knees.
716	1	a	Great craft cocktails, wonderful whiskey selection, and a surprisingly good (but small) craft beer selection.  Keith was super cool and helpful.  Stop in and have a few.  You won't regret it.  Im coming back when I am in Vegas.
717	1	a	Fantastic bartenders that have an exceptional attention to detail when making drinks. It takes a bit longer than normal to get a drink, but the results are phenomenal. Two words. Simply incredible.
718	1	a	Bartender was awesome to help find a kind of beer we liked to drink.. Gave us a few beers to sample to find one we liked.  Great atmosphere
719	1	a	Pinto took care of us Sunday night! What a pleasant experience by a very knowledgeable gentleman.  We will definitely be back to visit......
720	1	a	A plethora of brown liquors including those of the high-end and hard-to-find variety are showcased at this shipping container turned rustic hip drinkery. Place your spirited requests and trust in the very capable hands of what I would call THE up and coming dream team of bartender-mixologists, all of whom treat their craft as an art.
721	0	a	Seriously watched employee in kitchen rubbing his nose and eating. Never washed his hands as he prepared food , food was fair, after seeing kitchen in action, really lost my appetite . Says grand opening, I won't be back
722	0	a	We went here the week they opened. Staff was nice but food wasn't anything to rave about. The Singapore noodles tasted fine but the curry seasoning was too strong for my mom's liking. The shrimp lo mein was ok but tasted a bit salty. Don't get me started on the fried rice. The fried rice had no flavor to it and was drowning in chopped onions.\n\nMaybe I'm just being harsh because there used to be a Yummy Grill next door but this doesn't hit the spot like other Chinese restaurants in the Henderson area.
723	0	a	Out of all the Chinese take outs in the damn city I picked this one. Location was what made me choose this place,it's right off the freeway as I headed back to Phoenix.What I didn't do was check the rating/reviews. The man who took my order was extremely friendly and the place was pretty clean that's why I gave 2 stars. The food however, was disappointing. Everything was hot and fresh, but flavor was either off or lacking. I ordered the lunch chicken lo mein and my husband got the lunch Mongolian beef. His was ok, just ok nothing more. It seemed like a small portion in my opinion. My lo mein was pretty flavorless almost like spaghetti without sauce. I also ordered a hot and sour soup (they only offer 1 size & it's almost $5) and it was weird. Not really hot or sour but almost tasted like toast. The only good I can say about the soup is at least it had some substance to it and it wasn't all watery and thin. I love a good hot & sour soup and this was far from what I'd call good. Probably for the first time ever, I would have rather had Panda Express. I even passed one in boulder city and wished I would've waited. Bottom line, I wasted 18 bucks.
724	0	a	Bottom Line: The food was not the best, the service was non-existant.\n\nLos Dos was recommended to me by multiple friends, so of course, I had to give it a try.  We ordered the green chile with pork that was on special as well as the chimi.  Neither of these items were anything special.  The pork was quite fatty and did not appeal to me for this reason primarily, but in addition, the rice and beans lacked a distinct flavor putting them at the bottom of their categories.  The chimi was better, but the meat didn't have the expected strong flavor.\n\nThe salsa was actually pretty good, but the chips were stale and thick which really hampers a good salsa experience!\n\nFinally, the service was terrible.  First, no one at the door.  Finally, we found someone at ended up being told to seat ourselves.  Then, no server ever came for drinks or food until someone came and asked us if we still needed to be helped.  The proceeded to go and find the right person, give up 5 minutes later and then came back to take our order.  Then we waited another 5 minutes for drinks and salsa.  Never received a refill on either of them.  To top it off, then we never got a bill.  I actually got up to look for someone and finally found someone to help get us checked out.
725	0	a	First off, if you're coming here expecting a nice restaurant, don't bother, it's just another POS generic strip mall joint. Beyond that, I can't speak to the quality of the food because I wasn't ever able to try it. It doesn't matter how many hand scrawled signs you put on your front door advertising new hours, if your website and all your adverts say you're open till 9:00 people are going to expect you to be open till 9:00. If you want to close at the ridiculous hour of 6:00 PM then fine, but Maybe change your website first.
726	1	a	"I've been to Los Dos Molinos a handful of times, but just to pick up to-go orders of their famous salsa.  I usually get a pint of both the red & the green - both are some of the best I've ever had and is reason alone to go.  The salsa is absolutely on the hot side but more than manageable if you enjoy heat.\n\nI had my first dine-in experience with me, my wife, my 5 month old and my wife's parents (5 of us total).  The inside is fairly small and it was too hot to eat outside.  My father-in-law loves hot food and couldn't stop talking about how great it was.  My mother-in-law ordered some fresh guacamole to cool her palate.\n\nThe 4 of us each ordered something different and all of use really enjoyed our order.  Two things I'll mention: 1) the portions were huge and no one finished what they ordered 2) their reputation as \""the hottest food in phoenix\"" didn't necessarily live up to the hype.  3 of us ordered a dish with the chile next to it.  The flavors were very good - just not hot.  Adding some of the hot salsa kicked up the spice.\n\nWould recommend the food and especially the both salsas."
727	0	a	One star too many! I have frequented Los dos in Phoenix several times. This was my 2nd time to the Tukee location and I will never return.  First time was when it first opened. It was okay then but nothing too special. This trip was like something you'd see on a RI show! Walking up should have been our first clue. The patio looked like a junk yard. I get it's chili roasting season but what's with a bench on top of a table, mess everywhere dead plants in pots surrounding the patio just scary gross. The main entrance is now closed off with a sign telling you to go through the patio so ya really could not miss that eyesore.  It gets worse. Upon entering the room is very drab and dark. Only two other tables have folks seated. None looked too happy to be there but hey it's a work night ... Oh no happy hour going in in this place...didn't even see the bar anymore since that room was draped off. Anyway, back to the bad service.  Waiter told us to sit anywhere. Looking around we should have left but figured to give the place a chance if I could. Again, keep in mind, I'm comparing the food and service to the Phoenix location in my mind.  We sit at a table where there's one chair and a bench against the wall. As I sat down I realized there was a cable jack behind me that the cover was cracked off the wall.  Figured I'll be sitting straight the entire time. \nWaiter gets us water and hands us some menus and walks away. Didn't even offer if we wanted anything else to drink. He swings back by with some chips and salsa and asks if wear ready to order. Ok, I'll have the beef taco Combo and the bf ordered the green chili beef burrito. Poof, waiter gone.  While we waited I seriously was surfing the web trying to find out if the place had any health violations and what they were!\nAbout 20 minutes later food arrives. BFs burrito looks ok. Nothing fancy but not looking for fancy, just good food. Burro is jam packed with beef and the green chili is to be expected fire hot! Ok, taco combo...eh, had much better at filibertos. The beef tasted funny. It was dry and tough and could have been a couple days old. Didn't taste quite right. Rice was even older, I'd say probably 3-4 days old.  Beans were mediocre and the cheese enchilada was all tortilla with melted cheese on top. \nI highly recommend to NOT go here. Save your money, save your stomach, save your time!! If you want Mexican, filibertos is up in the foothills or Arribas is down the road a bit.  This place needs to close its doors!
728	0	a	I absolutely love this restaurant and frequent it at least once a month. It is painful for me to report that our last two visits have been horrible. The first, we arrived around 8:45 as we always do. The host said that the kitchen is closing soon insinuating that we were to late to be served. Grudgingly we were seating and, upon settling, had a great meal. The second, we showed up at 8:30 and were told that they were closed to prepare for tomorrow. Their stated hours are 9 pm close. I am so disappointed because we love this place. I am willing to give them one more shot. Hopefully they will go back to the warm service that we were accustomed too. It is sad to see that others have made similar comments.
729	0	a	"I was trying to go for a birthday dinner and saw online that they closed at 9:30. Called the restaurant to be sure and to let them know a large group would be in and was told they close at 7:30, which was okay. A group of 10 of us showed up at 5:00 to find a sign on the door, in pen, saying \""sorry we closed at 4:30!!!\"" (This was 20 minutes after we called). Incredibly unprofessional. Will not recommend this place nor will I go to this location again."
730	0	a	We waited over an hour for our food, which showed up to be only mediocre. They had live music which was decent.
731	0	a	Chose this place based on some other reviews. I should have read more carefully. I had Vicki's Plate. The chicken was really dry, sauce was so hot, I couldn't taste the food and guacamole so bland.\n\nSkip this one and keep driving.
732	1	a	Great services ! No hidden fees ! My network keep dropping and disconnecting I usually called the customer services number for the router and the network and stay on the phone with them for at least two hours on the phone  , and still not working properly , I called other companies to diagnose the problem they charge me 100$ for the visit and they said my router is not working and I have to get a new router and it will cost me at least a 130$ , I called then ICU computer , he fix it fast and was much cheaper , very reasonable and honest for the services . He add a hot spot to my house to cover some weak network coverage area  , he connect my playstation and xbox to the network , he added my printers to my network and I can print from any of my electronic devices , with ICU company I saved time and money and he is very practical
733	0	a	"Sure, it's a chain...but it's always exciting to see new places open in your neighborhood. We've been watching the progress of this Farmer Boys location and since I haven't eaten at one in 4-5 years, I was a little anxious for it to open so I could try them again. Last time I didn't like it, and this time was no different...\n\nFor starters, they have a great location right on the corner of Centennial Center & Tropical Parkway/Azure. They are on the SW corner where Big Lots, BJ's & Party City are, and with so many other surrounding businesses, this place is probably going to be packed throughout the day. We went just a couple days after opening and as expected, it was so busy it took us a while just to find a seat. The inside is a bit smaller than I expected but they do have a decent amount of seating and it's always nice to see big, open kitchens. There's a ton of parking outside and of course, they've got a drive-thru as well.\n\nThe menu itself is pretty extensive and a lot bigger than I remember. They've got breakfast, sandwiches, burgers, salads, wraps, a few side choices, and even a fried fish dinner. I didn't see anything that says if they specifically do or don't, but I believe breakfast is served all day as well. For those with a sweet tooth, they don't have much in the way of desserts besides a couple milkshake choices though.\n\nNow, the whole thing with Farmer Boys is it's supposed to be a fresh, \""farm to table\"" like restaurant. I've heard very few people rave about the food, and now I can see why. I ordered one of their self-proclaimed, \""Award Winning Burgers\"" and just wasn't a fan. The patties seem way too uniform to be fresh and aside from the complete lack of flavor in the meat, mine came out cold. All the toppings were basic, nothing seemed fresh and it was extremely sloppy. I also asked for bacon but instead got two small strips of sad, limp and flavorless meat. To top it off, the whole burger and the tray it came on, were soaked in grease. My chili cheese fries weren't much better. Frozen, over-salted fries and they didn't even bother trying to melt the cheese all the way.\n\nThey were also having issues with the ice and fountain soda machine when we were there, but instead of blocking it off, they expected customers to try and get their own drinks while some sweaty dude was hanging over the drinks and had his shoes all over the counter. Luckily, one of the managers noticed they were out of tea and happily offered to get me ice and fresh tea from behind the counter. The customer service was really the saving grace for me here. Every employee was friendly and it's nice they come around asking if you need anything or to clean up used plates and such.\n\nI know they're new and maybe I'm being too critical, but reading reviews of other locations, it seems like the food just really isn't that good. They are really close to us, so I might give them another try, probably for breakfast after a few weeks of being open...but for now, I'll pass on Farmer Boys."
734	0	a	This review is based on the prices, not the food. Here's what I have to say, WHY would I pay you $12.00 for a burger combo and it's not even Niman Ranch or Kobe Beef? Farmer Boys have lost their last mind. You're a burger place, that's it, the meat is not organic, neither is the vegetables you're using. You have a drive-thru just like McDonalds. So I am in line, the man in front of me orders 3 things and his total is $42.00 FOR WHAT! I told my husband, and he's the cheap one, not me, I guess In-N-Out and Tommy's will continue to be our best friend before I pay a burger joint $42 dollars to feed three people. And mind you, I've eaten at FB in California and I don't remember these outrageous prices for NON ORGANIC BURGERS! This BURGER JOINT, belongs on the STRIP, NOT in a family neighborhood with young children. You know what I noticed when I left and went to In-N-Out around the corner (BTW, the lines were around the block) it appears that everyone in the In-N-Out line was skidding into the parking lot. I told my husband they must of just left FB. LOL Will I return to FB, of course, I want a pastrami sandwich, lol, will I ever purchase a burger from FB, NOT GOING TO HAPPEN!
735	1	a	The burgers here were amazing! I had the double cheese burger and it was huge. I also had the fried zucchini and it was a good size portion. The zucchini was the perfect texture, but the batter was bland. It was the same for my husband's onion rings. I would suggest just having fries.
736	1	a	Great burgers. We ordered the Farmer Boy and The Natural. The onion rings are HUGE. Will be back for more.
737	0	a	"I will never go there again. I went there for the first time yesterday evening and ordered \""The Natural.\"" I got home opened it and the bun was twice the size if the \""natural\"" burger. Not only was it small and insignificant, but dryer than piece of cardboard. Anyways the reason I really wrote this review is because this morning I also woke up with severe stomach pain and diarrhea. Not fun while I get ready for work. Carls Jr has more high quality burgers."
738	1	a	The cheeseburgers, fries and zucchini were fast, fresh and tasty.  They just opened but food and service were excellent.  For a party of 8, the total was about $68 which included several shakes.  Shakes are only a $1 more when you get a combo!  I'm sure some of the early comments were from when they just opened and there were lines out the door. Highly recommend!
739	0	a	I don't get it , our food arrived cold and was tasteless. I didn't want to stand in line again to send it back since their is no table service. And it's pricey
740	1	a	I have to say, I was surprisingly happy eating at Farmer Boys! It was one of those days where I needed a quick bite while I was out running errands.  I ordered the grilled turkey sandwich with a side salad and pancakes ($1-2 add on)!  The sandwich tasted great! Everything was pretty good!\n\nI went through the drive thru which was a decent experience. They even gave me a couple extra sides of ranch dressing without any issue...and the ranch was freshly made instead of packaged! Farm fresh fast food!
741	0	a	My first time at FarmerBoys, just so so. The Pastrami sandwich was good as was the milkshake. The onion rings on the other hand, were terrible. The cracked corn coating was very thin and fell right off \n\nHad to wait in line after being served to ask for mustard and a fork. This was a 5 minute wait for items that should be readily available for customers. \n\nNot sure if I'll be coming g back.
742	0	a	I do not like to give bad reviews. This place has been open for 1 month. Given time, hopefully they can get it together. \n\nWent for breakfast, ordered omelette with hash browns. The food was NOT seasoned at all. And it was barely warm, yet the eggs were over cooked. \n\nThe 2 stars is for the helpful, yet surprisingly young, cashier. \n\nI don't see a reason to ever come back.\n\nOk: 1 hour later - I felt nauseated and got sick. No more Farmer Boys
743	0	a	Cold diner food. Blah. Last Sunday mom and I drove down to the restaurant which was pretty busy, and placed a big order to go. They had our order ready in about 20 minutes. When we got home, literally a 3 minute drive, most of the food was cold. I'm not sure what happened, because they have about 20 people working in the kitchen. Mom got an omelette and French toast, and a side of fruit which was from a can. Fail. My brother got some kind of breakfast bowl which is similar to the kind you get at Jack in the crack, and he did not like it. My dad got the tuna sandwich and fries, which were cold but tasty, he said the sandwich was ok. I got the pastrami and it was good but small, my boyfriend got the bacon burger with onion rings. He liked the burger but the onion rings were a complete fail. The breading was falling off the onion rings, and guess what? They were cold. We spent about $60 for everything and to say I was disappointed is an understatement.
744	0	a	Not impressed at all. We ordered 2 Farmers Burgers and 1 Big cheese. All burgers were cold to the point the cheese was still hard on top of them. We sent them back and the second time around they were pretty much the same but we were hungry and ignored it.  The interesting thing is that they say the food is made to order, well that is kind of hard when your food comes out 3 minutes after you ordered it, and the remake even faster than that. All in all really bad experience except the smiley kids at the counter
745	0	a	I was really looking forward to going here, what a let down. Nothing special about the food here. The burger I would rate average at best and cold fries. Nothing special about this burger.
746	1	a	Everyone has great customer service here , I have nothing to say about improving . It's just great and I appreciate them !
747	0	a	The restaurant is nice and clean; employees were friendly and I really liked the zucchini sticks...  \nBut the prices are very high for fairly small portions of fast food I feel I could make better at home.  If I'm craving zucchini I might go back, but otherwise I think there are better sandwich/burger-type places nearby... for a much better value.  A solid 2 stars.
748	0	a	So one of the worst burgers I've had in awhile, was not fresh was a frozen patty and a big bun, go to red robin in and out or smash if your smart. Plus it was $8.00 wow . my wife said her salad was good she didn't want the chicken on it but we still got charged!
749	0	a	Meh.\nIt's an ok meh, at best.\nLittle bit pricey for what you get.\nIf you get breakfast, the meat is extra on your sandwich, whaaaaaat?\nBurger was mediocre.
750	0	a	This is the second time I visited this restaurant. The first time I bought a burger but didn't taste too good so I thought I'd give it a second try. I walked in there with one other person and looked at the menu. I waited for about five minutes while the cashier and cooks all stared at me. I took my wallet out in attempt to let them know I would like to order some food from establishment. Cashier that would have taken my order continue to count her cash as the cooks continued to stare at nine. I then placed my wallet back in my rear pocket and did an about face. I exited the restaurant with no problem. Nobody tried to stop me and ask me, hey would you like to order some food? As I stated before this was my second visit to this restaurant, it will also be my last. I also feel like I was racially profiled.
751	0	a	This location is usually better than this. The Hearty Club Sanwich I purchased was pressed flat and was wet. I have had this sandwich before, this one was a gross failure and went in the trash. 1/8/2015 Order# 226 6:08pm Drive Thru.
752	1	a	These babies are ginormous! Perfect for when you are craving sugar.\n\nReminiscent of those a grandma or cool aunt makes at home from scratch. I had the Mocha Mocha- chocolate cupcake with coffee topped with a coffee buttercream frosting. Very light on the chocolate taste. I can definitely taste butter. Super moist. The chocolate buttercream has a hint of coffee in it. It was very creamy.\n\n$3 per cupcake.
753	1	a	Great new restaurant. The service was great and the food was delicious. Being from California, I hadn't found a place in Arizona that had good menudo. The menudo here was fantastic. It wasn't greasy and had the perfect amount of flavor. I also got a carne asada burrito to have later in the day and was just as happy with that. The burrito comes with rice and beans in it and had the perfect amount of carne asada in it too. I will definitely be back for more!
754	1	a	My husband and I had dinner here one evening.  I had the #2 taco & cheese enchilada, my husband had the #10 two soft carne asada tacos.  The Food was delicious!  We joined the clean plate club and plan to return, again.  We were also impressed with the red salsa which had a solid kick to it, but not too much.  I just wanted to add that the restaurant was clean and they are open daily from 6am to 10pm.
755	0	a	My boyfriend and I ate here because we wanted to try it. They got my boyfriends order wrong even though it was just one of the combos. They fixed it for him though. Both his and my food was average, nothing special, I can't even say that it is authentic since. The food tastes bland and my neighbor's for is much better than theirs. Their prices are a bit high for the quality and amount of food they give also. Definitely will not being going back any time soon.
756	1	a	Food great.Very quick. Attractive. Very clean. I had #5 combo and Pastor Taco. Truly enjoyable.
757	0	a	Was here for a company lunch... Decent food and ambience is very authentic Mexican... I ordered fish tacos which was good but it had a fish bone which got stuck in my throat ... I had to go to urgent care to get it removed later on... I can't imagine that this was not taken care of by the chef... Horrible experience as it did not work in my favor... My colleagues were upset as well as we did not expect this kind of problems to arise in a restaurant of such high caliber.
758	0	a	I wonder where some of these reviews have ate real authentic mexican food. I can tell you one thing it sure is not here. My wife and I ordered the enchilada combos. Mine beef, hers chicken. The beef taste like something out of a can. While there I noticed there was a large can of red  sauce, La Palma or something like that. Have seen it in grocery stores. The tortillas were horrible also. There s nothing authentic about this place except the Spanish speaking employees.
759	1	a	Hoi..1st to Review!\n\nGive Manila's Best - A Taste of Home some lovin'!  It's a brand spankin' new place for some delicious Filipino eats!  Just opened about a week and a half ago.  Please check it out!\n\nI'm a new fan because:\n\n1) The owner is a cool dude!\n2) The restaurant is clean!  The bathrooms are clean!\n3) The food is good!\n\nI cannot tell you how much a clean restaurant does for its reputation.  Being brand new you would expect cleanliness and Manila's Best has it in spades.  Let's hope they can keep it up this way, I feel much better eating in a place that pays attention to proper hygiene.\n\nLike Filipino food from the Homeland? Manila's Best is the newest, tastiest place to go!  Seriously, the food here is down-home country, not pretentious, and tasty.  Yes, Filipino food tends to be heavy, but the folks here at Manila's Best keep the greasiness to a minimum.  Nothing on the line was sitting for too long or drowning in its own grease.\n\nHere's some of the tender vittles on their menu:\n\n-Rice (lots and lots of white rice)\n-Bistek\n-Pork Adobo\n-Chicken Adobo\n-Beef Afritada\n-Grilled Pork Belly (damn delicious)\n-Pancit\n-Pork Sinigang (mmmm....sour)\n-Chicken Tinola\n-Fried Tilapia\n-Fried Chicken Skin\n\n\nI ate all of it...and loved it!  For me, I'm an Americanized Filipino and I noticed their food is lighter on the bagoong/patis side of the palette.  Which is a plus for me because DAMN sometimes my Nanay & Tatay are a bit heavy-handed on the fermented fish stuff!  But for you old skool' Filipinos I'm sure Manila's Best has some bagoong or patis on the side they can give you in case you're looking for that fishy feeling.\n\nManila's Best is really the best of both worlds, you can either enjoy a 2 or 3 item combo which includes rice and soup for under $7.  Or you can be a lechon like me and go all out for their special BUFFET....all-you-can-eat gloriousness for only $7.99 total!  Soft drink and tax already included!  Plus they give real plates, bowls, and silverware so you can feel like you're having a meal at home.  Things like that really add up to a great experience here.\n\nI really enjoyed Manila's Best, and they are looking for customers!  It was lunch rush today (on a Payday Friday) and the place was near empty.  So sad, poor thing!  These folks need a push from some social media.  And I am here to help with my outstanding review!\n\nSo you like-a-da Filipino food, please visit Manila's Best!  Your belly and your wallet won't be sorry!  Best price of $7.99 for their lunch and dinner buffet!  You go now!\n\nI think I will be going there again tonight.\n\nMASARAP!
760	1	a	Awesome food, exceptional service, clean environment plus friendly staff makes this place our next go to spot for Filipino food cravings while in Vegas. Owner, Glen, is very accommodating that he even offered our family barbecues as part of the buffet price. We will definitely be back!!
761	1	a	Good food, highly recommended. I got here early, I was the first person. Judging by the quality of the  buffet they taste fresh, this are not like those typical filipino buffet. I really like the crispy chicken skin perfectly cook and melt in your mouth. The staff are very friendly, I will for sure come back for more.
762	0	a	It's okay... Everything was pretty mediocre.
763	0	a	I went here after reading the reviews here but my visit was disappointing. Maybe it was because I went when it was slow but the food tasted old and the sinigang was way too salty.
764	1	a	This is a good place to eat home cooked Filipino food at the heart of Las Vegas. The taste is reminiscent of the lutong Bahay all pinoys know and love. We'll be back Manila' s Best!
765	0	a	Pretty disappointing that we arrived 40 min before closing, & they informed us they were closed already, except for special orders..
766	1	a	Tacos Huicho has the best Mexican tacos in Phoenix I ate. They have good food service and amazing tacos that are super delicious. The best part about Tacos Huicho is that if you like the food they have a butcher and you can buy the meat to take home and cook. Overall Tacos Huicho is the place to go for Mexican tacos.
767	1	a	There's a new ramen restaurant in town and this is not just another ordinary ramen place capitalizing on the new ramen craze in Vegas like many other ramen places popping up around town. This ramen can actually compete with the big names like the Montas or the Soras. So be afraid...Monta, be very afraid...Sora, you finally got some real competition.\n The menu is very extensive, you can actually have a complete meal here without having ramen, but since ramen was the reason I was here, that's exactly what I ordered. I went with their most popular which is the tonkotsu black, a very rich in flavor broth with pork chashu and the perfect toppings, fresh onions, fried onions, garlic, nori and a boiled egg and served with perfectly cooked thin noodles.\n I had to try the pork broth this time for comparison purposes but on my next visit I'll provably be nicer to my heart and order the chicken broth instead or even the vegetable soup ramen and I hope they're as good as the pork so I can stop here more often without the guilty feeling. \nService was great, I had no problems with my drink being refilled as needed and my waitress was very helpful explaining the menu and making recommendations. \nThe dining room is very spacious with many booths and tables, a bar facing the open kitchen and a majestic communal table in the middle inviting strangers to become friends by the power of ramen if only for just one meal.\n I can see Jinya Ramen becoming one of my favorite restaurants come winter, for I could definitely have ramen here every day, if only my arteries were twice as wide.\n\n#happy hour 3 - 5  = useful.
768	1	a	Just went to check this place out. Friendly atmosphere,  good service, great food. I gotta give it to the kid meal for $7 u get the chicken noodle soup, fries w/shrimp tempura and rice. Oh and it comes with a dessert too...for $7 it's a lot of food for a kid but really good. \n\nI almost forgot they have homemade tofu. I love it. Definitely going to go back.
769	1	a	"So glad Jinya is in Vegas now! If you love the thick Tonkotsu flavor this is the place to go. Service was good, except for our waitress didn't know what restaurant she worked for? She kept saying \""Chinga Ramen\""? I know they just opened and all but it's a big turn off,"
770	1	a	Newly opened restaurant, so definitely a few kinks to work out. The first problem is the shortage of wait staff and delayed seating of patients. We waited approximately 10 minutes for a table for 4, even though there was an empty table available the whole time we waited.  A party of 2 walked out since they were also waiting, but several 2 seat options were available the whole time they waited as well.... So efficiency and customer service definitely needs some work!  The restaurant decor is modern with wood paneling.  They also have a large family dining style table in the center, good for a large group.  One thing lacking is lunch service...I think they are missing out financially by starting their service at 3pm....\n \nIn regards to appetizer options, I would say Jinya ranks #1 of the ramen restaurants (even over Monta Chaya) for the variety of offerings.  The pork belly buns are $3.80 each or $3 during HH 3-5PM.  The pork belly is extremely tender and flavorful and the bun is nice and fluffy (pretty much like Peking duck but pork belly inside).  We also tried the truffle oil tempura brussel sprouts which were tasty but I've had better brussel sprouts (i.e. Yonaka).  The crispy chicken (comes in 5,10,15 piece orders) was extremely moist and had a nice crispy exterior, paired with a yuzu soy sauce. I would definitely order the chicken again.  I was a little disappointed when we sat down and the waiter started listing off multiple items they had run out of (i.e takoyaki, shrimp toast, assari ramen, etc).  Not really a good start with half the menu items missing or unavailable =(  I'm a takoyaki fiend, so I was very sad to hear they ran out.  The waiter informed us that the shrimp toast is being removed from the menu....not sure why, since he said it was delicious.\n\nIn terms of ramen, the following are my rankings for Vegas:\n1. Kogashi ramen with thick noodles (Fukumimi)\n2. Tonkatsu black with thick noodles (Jinya)\n3. Tonkatsu with thick noodles (Monta)\n\nThe tonkatsu broth at Jinya has depth of flavor and the broth is very hearty.  I prefer the broth here over Monta, since Monta can often be too salty.  I ordered the tonkatsu black which has garlic oil and chips, chili paste, a whole seasoned egg, nori, kikurage (fungus), green onion, nori,  The flavor marriage of these items makes the broth stand out and I would say the broth is on par with Fukukimi's broth, albeit different.  The pork belly is not quite as fatty as Monta's,  but is flavorful and tender similar to Fukumimi's.   The one thing that leaves Jinya at #2 in my rankings, is the consistency of the noodles.  My noodles were slightly overcooked and some noodles were clumped together in a ball....  Hopefully, they work that out, since I think the consistency of the noodles is very important to the ramen experience.  A nice touch is the raw garlic that is free, they bring over a garlic press so you can have fresh pressed garlic to your hearts content.   The wait time for the ramen was about 15-20 minutes after our appetizers...they are definitely lacking the efficiency of Monta.  However, if you want to sit and chat, this is the place to go.  You never feel like they are rushing you out of the restaurant.   I'll definitely be back to try this place out in another month or so, I'm guessing things will be even better then!
771	0	a	I love ramen, so I'm always excited to try new ramen places. The ambience of the restaurant is nice and because it is a new restaurant, it is still very clean. The ramen was a little over priced. The broth didn't have much flavor to it but the portions were large. My cousin ordered gyoza, but it wasn't anything out of the ordinary. Excellent customer service.
772	0	a	"We decided to check out this new spot after our late night movie. We walked into the restaurant and it had a cool layout. There's a giant table in the middle with multiple booths surrounding it. \n\nWe were seated at this tiny booth for two along the wall. Then the server approached us, asking how our day was and in return she told us she's had a long day and it could have been better... Like what do you say back to that?! Awkwarddd... \n\nThen she briefly explained the menu and their popular items and gave us literally 1 minute to look over the menu. I get that they are going for a dim dinner feel, but we could not see what the menu had to offer. We had to pull out the flashlight on our iPhones to read the menu. She came back but obviously we weren't ready, because we couldn't even read the menu to begin with.. \n\nFinally she came back and my boyfriend and I both picked out the spicy chicken ramen. I'm kind of a picky eater so I asked what each ingredient was. When I asked about the \""Tokyo Negi\"" she literally stood there for 30 seconds, blank stare, not knowing how to explain what it was.... So I just asked for that on the side. \n\nI added mushrooms, corn, and butter. As she was taking our order on the iPad, I had to repeat over and over what I wanted.. Again she said, sorry it's been a long night..   \n\nAfter that I went to the ladies room. I was surprised by their high tech toilet that lifted up by itself when it felt my motion near it. It even had a seat warmer lol! And that was the highlight of my experience there, pretty much hah.... \n\nFinally, our food came out and I didn't see the butter or the mushrooms..  Pretty bummed out, but I didn't say anything. I was so hungry, that I could not  wait any longer. My stomach was growling all day.\n\nOverall the food was good, but I still like Monta Ramen wayyy better!! \n\nTheir service definitely needs improvement if they want to compete with the others."
773	1	a	"JINYA specializes in tonkotsu flavored ramen which is based off a pork bone broth. I think JINYA does a fantastic job with their broth. It is creamy, rich and full of flavor. THey have several options for their broth, I went with a spicy tonkotsu broth with a spicy level of \""spicy\"" which i assume is considered medium. The ramen was cooked firm the way I like it, it had pork slices, but more sliced than normal, eggs, green onions and some of the other regular stuff you'd expect in the ramen. \n\nI honestly felt like I could have gotten away with the tonkotsu assari which had about the same things in my ramen minus being spicy. Reason being was they have a bunch of condiments to still make your broth spicy so you could save a couple of bucks. \n\nJINYA also offers a ton of toppings, they also have some really fresh garlic you get to mash yourself. I was not a huge fan of their takoyaki, too much batter, not enough octopus imo. They also have fried brussel sprouts in truffle oil, tasted like any other tampura fried item, truffle oil does not elevate the taste.\n\nOverall, I think this place is great for their tonkotsu ramen."
774	1	a	This is the newest Ramen spot in Las Vegas, me and my wife wanted to try since we do like trying new resto's and trying to compare with the one's that we tried before we checked out the Happy Hour which is 3-5 pm. \n\nWe ordered the Jinya Bun which is definitely a must try, it sweet, and juicy, the karaage was excellent, and quinoa salad was something refreshing and definitely something new. \n\nThe Ramen was OK though. \n\nThe service was great. The Ramen plus the excellent sides I would definitely come back to try other side dishes on their menu. Over all I would definitely  come back.
775	1	a	Not exactly 4 stars but more like 3.5 stars. Food was decent but not as good as Monta Very very nice staff. Very nice decor. Lighting was too dark and music was way too loud. Was really disappointed that they didn't have any Japanese fried rice!! Had some other tapas that was ok but not really a Raman Raman place... They had tapas that you can pair together with a Raman which is nice but Raman house to me is Raman, gyoza, and fried rice. Heads up, just stick to the pork broth and skip the chicken broth Raman
776	1	a	"Jinya is a solid ramen spot, and it is by default the best ramen spot after midnight. Not bad for the new kid on the block.\n\nIt was actually quite crowded for the late (12:30) hour. Only one space seemed to be open aside from the giant communal table in the middle of the room. The host asked us if we'd been there before and, as we hadn't, thoroughly explained the menu. Then we got into the menu think tank.\n\nI saw Philip T's recommendation of the takoyaki and decided to give it a whirl. It's pretty good. Nice crispy outer layer, lots of tako (octopus) inside, lots of bonito flakes, and two sauces, similar to the one \""authentic\"" takoyaki that I'd had before from a tent inside a Mitsuwa Marketplace. The inhabitants of that tent are apparently well-known for takoyaki back in Japan, and I certainly enjoyed their version of it. The one thing I didn't enjoy too much on Jinya's takoyaki was the chewy texture on this one compared to the remarkably tender tako on the other.\n\nI had the tonkotsu assari per a friend's recommendation. It was pretty solid. The broth was very different from other pork broths that I've had, almost as if there wasn't actually enough pork. I actually used the ramen seasoning provided at the table on the broth later on and ended up with a flavor more reminiscent of other broths that I've had, but I typically never have to add any additional condiments. Anyway, noodles seemed to be a bit over al dente but wasn't terrible. The egg was one of the softer eggs (although not runny) that I've had in a ramen, and I also enjoyed the generous fungus, green onion, and bean sprouts. I do wish that there had been more than the one piece of chashu.\n\nOverall, service was solid (lots of getting checked up on in addition to the menu walkthrough), and I did enjoy the ramen even though it seemed lacking in some ways. Given the surprising abundance of ramen options in Las Vegas, I wouldn't necessarily go back here unless I was looking for ramen in the wee hours of the AM. Last call is at 2:45am, which is pretty nice if you're meeting up with a friend who's just arrived in town. Or something else. I have no clue what else people could be doing in Vegas at such a late hour..."
777	1	a	"Not only is this place nice inside, the broth is ON POINT. There are a few other locations in California, Canada and Texas. Not sure if  I would consider it a \""chain\"" though. I will be back to try something new and order a few of the same things. \n\nPROS: Tonkatsu Black (#1) ramen\n             Jinjya bun\n             Tokyo Yatai ramen\n             Crispy chicken\n\nCONS:  Priced on the higher side (but really good quality)"
778	1	a	I'm. Surprised.\n\nNever thought I would see a ramen place excel higher than monta. Well, this place is pretty damn close. Keep it up and I would say they finally raised the bar for ramen in this town! Their broth (tonkatsu premium white) is less salty, thick and creamy. It sits well in your stomach. It doesn't feel fattening, and is really light. When you eat it, it goes down so smooth and you don't feel humongous after you eat a bowl. You simply feel satisfied.\n\nGet the combos for more for your buck! Awesome prices. Chasu bowls are really good. The Jinya bun is suuuuper yummy I could eat those all day.\n\nThe atmosphere is awesome. Nice setting. Loud music. When you walk in they immediately greet you hello. When you walk out they immediately greet you goodbye. You feel like you're a famous someone, and that's an awesome feeling! The waitresses are super sweet! She even remembered me after just two visits. This place is definitely a hot spot. \n\nTheir girls bathroom is also pretty awesome. And I love the fact that they're open late til 3am. Finally don't have to rush for ramen because most of them close at 11am.\n\nKudos to you, Jinya.
779	0	a	Nice decor inside and out for world wide chain.  Food good not great and higher priced.  Hiromaru better tasting for similar price.  Monta much better bargain.  Music here was so loud could not have conversation.  Who comes to these places to listen to loud 'club' music?  Hard seats need cushions.  Too many better places so would not return.
780	1	a	I've been waiting for Jinya to open for a while now after hearing about it a long while back during a ramen festival. And so when they did open up, of course I had to go. My friends and I decided to give it a try one of the nights for dinner.\n\nWe started off with the organic tofu, which was made in front of you! It was pretty awesome to see. The texture of the tofu was a bit rough than what I'm used to and when I was eating it, all I could think about was how I wanted some syrup to go along with it and turn it into dessert tofu! Taste wise, nothing really special but interesting experience.\n\nI also got a Jinya Bun to try, which was pretty much a pork belly bun. I gotta say...I've had better. It was a lot of sauce on the bun and most of the times, it covered the flavors of the pork belly and .. I didn't really like that. It was a sweet smokey type of sauce and it wasn't exactly very appealing to me. \n\nAs for the ramen, I decided to go with the spicy chicken ramen at their spiciest level. I normally go with a tonkotsu but most ramen places in Vegas make their tonkotsu broth really heavy and salty so I didn't really want to go there. Instead of their thin noodles, I decided to sub it with their thick noodles. I like my noodles al dente and most places don't cook their thin ramen noodles that way so I took the chance and went with the thick ones.\n \nGood choices on my part. The broth was light and very good. It is not heavy, not salty, and not too spicy even though I can take really spicy things. Best of all, I didn't get tired of the taste of it. When I normally eat tonkotsu, I get tired of the flavor really fast. The noodles were perfectly al dente! \n\nOn the side note, their bathroom is very romantic. It was quite dim with some lights around the mirror and lights around their toilet. Their toilet's lid automatically comes up! Its one of those bidets -- pretty spiffy. All they really need is some soothing music in the bathroom and we could have a nice rendezvous there! \n\nOverall, great ramen. Would definitely come again to try other things! (:
781	1	a	JINYA have a diverse menu compared to most Ramen restaurants in Las Vegas. They offer dishes to add onto your ramen like pork gyoza, Tokyo curry rice and crispy chicken. JINYA also has an additional page of tapas, rice bowls and desserts. \n\nMy waitress recommended the pork bun to start. At $3.80 it was the most expensive single pork bun I have ordered. It arrived on a small black plate with a toothpick in the center to hold it together.  It ended up being a reasonable size for the high price. The bun was fluffy and unlike most pork belly the meat was lean. It was also very tender but I thought the lettuce in the bun was unnecessary and would have done better with just the cucumber. The sauce did not pack enough punch for me so I mixed the house made ramen sauce and chili sauce to dip the rest of the bun into. \n\nFor my ramen, I decided on the chicken ramen because my waitress said it was her favorite and had just as much flavor as the pork broth without being too rich. She was right, it was the most flavorful chicken ramen broth I have had. It was rich, creamy, but the noodles were too chewy for my taste. \n\nJINYA ramen has a much better chicken broth than any of the other ramen restaurants I have been to in town. Their three house made sauces are well executed and their diverse menu will bring me back even if I am not in the mood for ramen.
782	1	a	Had an amazing lunch with my family!  They have an excellent selection of appetizers, ramen soups, other items for people that don't want ramen, and a kids combo.   I had the Jinya no.1 ramen which was amazing!  Very tasty broth and everything went well together.  \n\nMy niece and nephew shared the kids combo which is an awesome deal!  Crispy chicken, french fries, rice, seaweed I think,  tomatoes and lettuce and a kids tofu pudding for $7!  They are very kid friendly and have nice colorful plastic dishes, cups with lids if you need one, and kids utensils.  \n\nMy brother and sister in law got the vegetable ramen and the chicken cilantro ramen which were also awesome!   We shared the tofu pudding with lychee and other sliced fruit, I'm hooked on tofu pudding!  The service was also great!   Attentive and informative.  Oh and the restrooms are really cool with the fancy toilets!   I will be back!
783	1	a	Had the Jinya buns and hiyashi (cold) ramen special with sesame sauce. Both were great, among the best I've had. I would especially recommend the sesame sauce on the hiyashi ramen. It reminded me of a cold sesame sauce ramen I had once in Tokyo which I've never been able to find outside Japan. Only reason for four stars is that the waitress was too loud and aggressive.
784	1	a	Atmosphere is nice, only complaint is music is pretty loud for some reason.\n\nGyoza was delicious! Came out quickly.\n\nThe ramen on the other hand took a while, so I recommend you have patience if you come. Not sure why its taking so long.\n\nHow was it?\n\nYummy...\n\nI had the chicken and pork broth..\n\n\n\nToilet seat experience.... don't be scared :P just push the buttons.
785	1	a	Look out Monta, there's a new kid on the block. Actually, Jinya is quite a few blocks away but it is on par, dare i say better? Having consumed the Tokyo special which includes the standards by which to judge ramen: tonkatsu pork and pork broth, i think better is a consideration.\n\nI found the pork broth to be heavy and filling in the best way. Creamy umami permeates the entire bowl and delivers satisfaction with the perfect amount of salty-ness. Speaking of perfect, i have to mention the temperature of the dish which was, perfect. The only thing worse than cold ramen is losing taste buds right out of the gate!\n\nAdd to this slightly aldente noodles and flaky, delightfully seasoned pork and you have a serious contender for Vegas' best ramen. I can't wait to return for more of the small yet exciting menu.\n\nDo be advised that this is a ramen bar so expect a bar-esque music volume, not really my bag thus the four stars but it won't stop me from a return visit.
786	1	a	Decided to meet up with a friend here for lunch. Despite my first 15 minutes in this place waiting by the door because I wasn't able to sit until my whole party of two people were there, this place is pretty good food-wise. The prices are really good in my opinion, $15 total for drink, salad, Cali roll, and ramen was great. I still prefer Sora because I feel their broth is just so nice and rich, and they have a much nicer service. What I didn't like is not being able to sit at a table when I was only waiting for one other person and there were seven empty tables and the place wasn't busy at all. It was also pretty funny when the couple behind me had complained about not being able to get seated when it was just them and they were staring at a wall of empty tables.
787	1	a	Referred by friend, just try it out tonight. When the door open, heard very loud music. Very difficult to communication with the waitress, I have to speaked  very loud to order the foods. There not enough light. The Jina Bun was great. Ramen are so so, too much oil, too creases. Too salty.
788	1	a	Super yummy ramen and close to the strip! Who knew Las Vegas would have a good ramen spot? I'm excited to learn that they have one in Los Angeles ahahaha good thing because I live in LA! \n\nI had the pork spicy ramen and the big noodles were chewy and tasty my bf had the chicken spicy ramen but like mine more better. They also have add a salad and app for $3.95 I think.. Lol more it's worth it so get it!
789	1	a	"Love love love this place. Sucks that I live in n. Las Vegas cause I want to go here more. Also they ruined \""normal\"" ramen for me. I can't seem to enjoy noodle soup from the grocery store anymore. Ahhhhh. None the less it was amaze, and when I'm down there again I will totally go again."
790	1	a	I had the Tokyo Tonkotsu Special, Pork Gyoza, crispy chicken, and the Brussels Sprout tempura.\nThe broth was thicker and more savory that Monta which is my favorite place in town.\nThe pork wasn't as flavorful and good.\nThe gyoza was very well done, very juicy but were very vegetable heavy which is good /for me/ but some may prefer theirs more on the pork side.\nThe sprouts tempura was good but maybe a little undercooked.\nThe Crispy chicken was good but nothing about it really stood out for me\n\nAll in all I wouldn't say it's /the/ best but it's /one of the/ best places for Ramen in town. it's also bigger than some of the really tiny places so hopefully the wait won't get bad.\n\nI will frequent this place
791	1	a	nothing wrong with another ramen place opening up, especially when they are putting out excellent eats. A nice opened spaced dining area as where some other places cram you in. There is a larger table in the middle where different groups or individuals can come together. They also had some good music pumping, a little reggae as I recall.  \nI had the Tonkotsu Assari bowl. It was such a flavorful broth that I left some noodles behind while sipping the broth to its end. I also had the tempura Brussel sprouts. A bit salty for me but I definitely enjoyed them this way. Another star of the meal was the Jinya bun. pork belly on a steamed bun how could you go wrong. I will definitely be coming back to try the many different options Jinya Ramen Bar has to offer.
792	1	a	Love this place! Right around the corner from my house and open late! The Quality is great and the service is always fantastic.  It's little more expensive than other ramen places but worth it
793	1	a	Excellent ramen & takoyaki. At decent prices as well. Would come back everyday if I can, especially for the takoyaki. I mean it's $4.80! It's a steal! \nCustomer service is also a thumbs up. Very well appreciated by the waitresses. They also do bill separation with your pals when you request for it. \nAtmosphere is a plus. Might be a bit small but it's still good.
794	1	a	What a yummy lunch just off the strip. But if you aren't very hungry you must stop in to the ladies restroom just for the luxury of it.
795	0	a	This place is so poorly designed first of all if your entire party is not present you can't be sat and they don't have anywhere for waiting guests to sit and the waiting area is tiny.
796	0	a	Ramen Jinya, I love you but a C rating for health inspection is NOT okay. Also, you should visit your studio city location for quality control as the spicy chicken ramen was watered down and not nearly as flavorful. Server was really nice and decor looks great but step it up!
797	0	a	I ate at Jinya the first time last night.  Came home started vomiting and diarrhea.  Whatever was in their food made me really sick.  Will never return!!!
798	1	a	I think I've found a new favorite ramen spot.\n\nWalking into the restaurant, you're greeted with dim lighting and a romantic atmosphere. The interior design recalls Japanese influences with an modern and industrial feel. In the center of the restaurant is a huge wooden sharing table with cool light fixtures hanging above them. Smaller tables line the walls and windows.\n\nOur server was informative of the menu pointing out that the pictures on the menu were their popular items. \n\nI got the tonkatsu and my roomie had the spicy chicken ramen. Now, a lot of people claim that this place is better than Monta. I won't agree to that but I will say that quality and taste of the ramen is good in it's own way and is on the same level as Monta. That's just my honest opinion. The broth is a little lighter but still full of amazing flavors.\n\nI definitely recommend this place to everyone who is a ramen lover or just curious to try a new restaurant. I'll be back to try more of their ramen options.
799	1	a	My favorite Ramen place! A little bit bummed that it's in Dirty Dining.. And I take those things seriously. But with Jinya....I'm coming back for more regardless (I do hope they fix it).. Yeah, it's that good.
800	1	a	Food is great! To be honest I first thought it had a fast food concept and was a little sketchy but it's not at all. Not sure what I ordered, all I know is that it was one of there specials and it had pork in it. Great new place. Definitely coming back!
801	1	a	At first I was pretty skeptical about this place because it had been on dirty dining consider that it just opened couple months ago, but because this place just opened I figure I would try it out anyway.\n\nThe ambiance is pretty nice and the food we ate was delicious. I wasn't a big fan of the crispy chicken, it was hard to chew and nothing about it wowed me. The shrimp toast and Brussels sprouts tempura in the other hand was pretty good. I definitely also recommend spicy miso Tonkotsu ramen. \n\nOur server was very knowledgable with the menu and attentive which made the experience even better. Tipped her 20% because she earned it lol. I also like the fact that they are open late.\n\nI must add, the toilet is pretty fancy!
802	1	a	Now, there are only a few late night eateries I can go to. AYCE sushi, Roberto's, and of course bars. But when I stumbled upon this gem. Who doesn't want ramen at 2am? This place is great! First off, I adore the atmosphere. It's very mellow and dark (as a ramen bar should.) \n     I've had my server Alex, 3 times and each time she was remarkably nice and very attentive. From what I can tell, so is the rest of the staff.\n     As for the food, in my opinion, Jinya does ramen right. The pork broth I had was flavorful and slightly thick. Noodles were on point. The Cha Sui pork slices melted in mouth and nothing is better than their seasoned egg. The appetizers we ordered, which consisted of Spicy tuna of crispy rice, crispy chicken, and pork Gyoza, were also all delicious! \n      If you're looking for genuine ramen, even if it's late night. Then Jinya is the place you need to go.
803	1	a	My taste buds were very surprised by the balanced flavors of the Ramen! I expected it to be very salty because it was the saltiest ramen but it was just PERFECT. The spicy miso ramen is a little too sweet for my taste but most people would probably like it. It has a lot of flavor and definitely not salty like a lot of other ramen places. Although it's not as salty as other places, it packs more flavor. The pork gyoza was cooked to perfection. The ramen #1 black was very rich, but it balanced out the saltiness. There was black garlic oil that made the ramen soup rich but it wasn't overpowering it at all. It complimented the thin noodles. Definitely the ramen I will remember the most. The takoyaki was pretty average because everything else was phenomenal. The Chashu bowl was average because there was only a little amount of Chashu and it was cut into pieces. It would have tasted better is it was whole in my opinion.
804	1	a	"First visit with the wife for lunch. Ample parking, it's in a shopping center, smart modern d\u00e9cor.  Staff very attentive and friendly.  Service was very speedy, and the food was extremely tasty.  Both had Takoyaki, which are very tasty and addicting, and their number one seller the \""Black\"" ramen.  Tasty, tasty, tasty!  Will definitely go back to try other menu offerings."
805	1	a	My go-to for to-go! \nEspecially if there's a wait, and there usually is. \nIt's also really good to eat onsite... even though the seats aren't that comfortable. \n\nMy favorite ramen is the Jinya White, which is a mix of their Pork and Chicken broth. With the two flavors, it's not too porky and the chicken adds a clearness which gives a cleaner style broth. \n\nThick noodle is better than thin, in my opinion. \n\nOrder Spicy and get the Hot level; it's good. \n\nThey make a good egg, so I usually add an extra. \n\nPork chashu is not the best I've had but it's still good. \n\nIf you're onsite, ask for fresh garlic. It adds a special kick, but it is something you and your party should partake in, or the odd one out will be the vampire target. Or get punished by garlic essence. \n\nI also really like the combination meal where you can order a side dish. My favorites are their housemade gyoza or chicken chashu bowl. If I'm not that hungry, I ask the server to pack up the bowl so I can have for lunch the next day. \n\nI did not like the Brussel Sprouts - it's not light tempura style at all and had too much batter. \n\nPork Bun - It's a good version and I would order again. \n\nAll in all, my new favorite ramen spot in town. Lots of versions and variety for all to enjoy.
806	1	a	For a regional chain, this place is a pretty good spot for some good ramen and appetizers!  We had a good group so got to try quite a bit of appetizers:\n\nGyoza - Pretty good, it's pork and veggies and pan fried.  Not a big fan when they someone does deep fried gyoza.\n\nTempura Brussel Sprouts - Didn't care much for it, a lot of batter and pretty bland for my taste.\n\nFried Chicken - Big pieces of their version of chicken karage.  Very tasty and seasoned very well.\n\nFresh Tofu - This was a pleasant surprise, if you have some time and like tofu give this dish a try.  They actually make fresh tofu for you at the table.  Note, this is plain tofu and you have to add the ginger, scallions, fish flake, and soy sauce that they bring on the side.  It takes some time for it to form, if you're not sure when it's ready they should be able to tell you.\n\nBlack Ramen - The soup base was pretty good, not a fan of the thin noodles though.\n\nSpicy Chicken Ramen - This was really good and I asked for the thick noodles instead of the thin.  The noodles were chewy and the soup base was yummy.\n\nThe service was good.  It does get really busy here, so plan to wait a bit and make sure your whole party is here or they won't seat you.
807	1	a	Jinya Ramen Bar has an interesting seating arrangement with individual tables surrounding a large center table that can fit total of 15+. After frequenting Monta and Sora countless times, I decided to give Jinya a try. \n\nUpon looking at the menu, I was enamored by the Jinya Pork Bun which was excellent. A friend in the party ordered gyoza and that was surprisingly good. (My expectations for gyoza are usually pretty low)  \n\nNext came the Spicy Chicken Ramen with HOT spice level. It was ok, nothing too special. Friend got the Tonkotsu Black which is more garlicky and rich and I think that would have been a bit more to my liking. 3 stars\n\nComparing all these ramen places is difficult, but I'd still rank Ramen Sora as my personal favorite. However, the side dishes (Pork Bun and Gyoza) were so delicious that I give it 4 stars.
808	1	a	MUST HAVE RAMEN!\nIf you like Ramen, you'll love this place! Broth is delicious, best Ramen we've had so far and we have tried many places in San Diego. You won't be disappointed with any Ramen choice!
809	1	a	Wow!!!! Best Ramen I've had since Japan.....amazing spicy miso tonkotsu ramen.....and the gyoza was wonderful. Five stars from me because the service and ambiance made the whole package five stars!!!
810	1	a	We ordered \nTakoyaki (octopus ball) with Bonito flakes. There was one itty bitty tiny octopus inside and mostly batter. Kinda bland.\n\nSpicy chicken ramen (chicken broth, chicken chashu, spinach, spicy bean sprouts, tokyo negi, green onion, chili oil served with thin noodles). This is really good and recommended. \n\nTonkotsu assari (pork broth, pork chashu, kikurage, green onion, seasoned egg, spicy bean sprouts, served with thick noodles). Hearty and flavorful. :)\n\nTan Tan Men (No soup ramen: noodles with spicy sauce, ground pork, Tokyo negi, Bol choy, red bell pepper, seasoned egg, fried onion, served with thick noodles). It's just okay. \n\nIt's more spacious compared to other ramen places. Service is fast and efficient. Will be coming back. :)
811	1	a	Cozy atmosphere. Great for a date night! The chicken and rice bowl that I had seemed really simple on paper, but the flavors blew me away. The tempura brussel sprouts were also seasoned to perfection!
812	1	a	Along with an upbeat rhythmic atmosphere, not to mention the late night availability, this ramen joint is pretty great! Food's amazing and very fast whenever you're getting apps or a quick bite to eat! Oh and the ramen is perfect, not to chewy but also not too soft as well ... just right.
813	1	a	"Jinya is a welcome addition to the local ramen scene.\n\nActually, the scene is getting too hot that some of the otherwise good joints have closed down and considering that, Jinya seems to have attracted a solid customer base.\n\nMy favorite so far is \""Tonkotsu Assari\"", as mentioned by Philip T it is a basic, no cheat fare. Tonkotsu Black is also good and rich, but it can be too heavy when I'm not super hungry.\n\nJinya is also one of the closest, most accessible ramen spots from the strip when we have a visiting friend.\n\nOverall, I'm very happy with their food and service."
814	1	a	Another Ramen spot added to the Vegas scene. One that heard lot of great things about and happy finally got to check out. I came here with some friends visiting from the 808. I was telling them about new Ramen spot in town. I had my worries cause back home Ramen is almost as common as Spam musubi. So pleasing the local boys would be tough. JINYA never missed a beat 808 style.\n\nI remember years ago the building that JINYA in changed few times over the years. My last memories thinking was fast food chain. So walking into the restaurant was totally different world. I like the whole revamp look from the interior the lighting fixtures, the huge community table is different, still have your booths, also have small but tradition Ramen Bar area with bar stools (have your own private show of sorts watching the chefs at work), all the bowls Ramen serve in screams personality, the sake box of sorts that the tempura brussel sprouts served in, and even the outside clearly stands out. The fact that it opens till 3am...\n\nJINYA not very big place but then again most Ramen spots here in Vegas not that big. So if you go when busy expect to wait or do like three of us did community table. We started with tow appetizers the JINYA bun and the Tempura Brussel Sprouts. The JINYA bun was ok. I was thinking more along the line of peking duck with oyster sauce in steamed bun. It amounted too was charsu in steamed bun. I needed sauce or something bring personality to the dish. The brussel sprouts that was amazing!! Honestly after having the brussel sprouts give regular traditional shrimp tempura bad name. The brussel sprouts was perfect nice al dente and hot inside. The tempura batter was perfect consistency not over heavy or light. It had the right amount of coating, flavor, and the truffle oil on top took it to another level. Appetizer that must in restaurant this is one highly recommend. Addicting we crushed it between three of us. \n\nI went with the Tonkatsu Spicy. It had nice kick. I love the broth had so much depth and mention the kick again. If not enough they have different spicy condiments on the table. I love all the stuff that on top of the Ramen. You get nice size portion of noodles in the bowl. The bowl deceiving cause lip of the bowl not wide but deep bowl. I know had noodles till the end. \n\nThe menu has great diversity. Few more appetizers that looked (lot of the items have picture on the menu) good! The Ramen again diversity even have vegetarian one. One of the best things about the menu. They offer combinations with choice of appetizer plus ramen. The catch is can only go with the combinations they offer. Still something that can not think of other Ramen spots that offer it. Ramen and gyoza that must for me. I got the best of both worlds. The homemade gyoza was awesome. The combination gyoza you only get four pieces instead of regular order of six. \n\nThe service was excellent. She was on it the whole time.
815	1	a	I love this place. It really a different Ramen experience. Has a lot more sophistication than most Ramen bars. Decor is nice staff is attentive. Im still trying all of the different Ramen selections. Stay tuned....
816	1	a	Just barely off campus (the strip), but very worth the drive / cab ride. Great prices. Very tasty ramen & curry. This is our 5th or so visit. Was nice to see a line waiting for them to open. Places like this should succeed.
817	1	a	Bigger place than Monta ramen. Spicy ramen delicios. My wife get tonkatsu ramen.takoyaki so yummy too
818	0	a	Not enough soup for the tonkotsu and yes tonkotsu is all about the soup.  What is the point for marketing tonkotsu when stingy on soup.  Not recommended!!
819	1	a	First time here, the waiter was nice and kept coming back to make sure we were doing ok. The food was great! Recommend getting your ramen spicy for an even better flavor.
820	1	a	Great quality food!  The shrimp tacos are amazing!  Delicious salsa & the best ceviche in town.  Kind of hidden in Cristown mall but if you're in the area I highly recommend stopping by for a quick delicious bite!
821	0	a	"Let me ask you, Would you be a lil' confused if you went to a German Restaurant & the whole staff just about (or at least the front house; hostess, waitress, bartender) was all Black or Asian?\n\nOK, So while visiting AZ, I wanted to try some \""Soul Food\"" (as advertised) and Stacy's was the only one open at this time that was somewhat close by.. so I decided to drive out to try it. \n\nWhen I walked in, it was almost like a culture shock! (No Lie) From me & the front house apparently because they just LITERALLY stood there looking (3 white women)!! I felt like I was at a Rodeo show & happen to land at this rodeo house type restaurant.\n\nBecause the bar is directly the first thing you come in contact with when walking in, I walked directly to it since the staff probably didn't even have a clue where they was at,. They all looked spaced out & confused. I won't come back maybe just based on the staff they hired to represent this soul food restaurant really.  \n\nThey seem reluctant to want to say anything. I asked was it there first day opening, explaining why they were acting so ignorant but she said that they had been open since July. \n\nThe ribs were OK, the sauce was good I guess but the corn bread could of used some more time getting cooked & the corn bread also tasted FISHY!\n\nThe Mac & Cheese was mediocre & could of been cooked longer too & my side order of beans were HARD. \n\nGood Riddance."
822	0	a	Ordered here 3 times now. First time, ordered the brisket sandwich. Was good tasting but a terrible price for the amount of food you get. Second time, ordered some ribs and corn bread, ribs were good and bread was alright. Third time was the big problem, ordered a melody burger which comes with a side and bacon along with an order of mac and cheese. The burger came with ONE piece of bacon on the entire thing, the burger was not cooked all the way through and the mac and cheese was dry and as others said, seems like out of a box. On top of this, the burger was so pink in the inside, barely looked edible was so under cooked. Ended up throwing out the burger, barely touched the mac and cheese and the only thing enjoyable was that piece of bacon and the potatosalad. Looks like 3 strikes their out in my book.
823	1	a	Really good BBQ. Tried the brisket, hot links, tater salad, cowboy beans, cornbread and fried okra. Great hickory smoked flavor that is not common in AZ. Fresh, cornmeal battered okra fried up perfectly, Good sized portions and fairly priced.\n\nSaid they have blues bands on Tuesday and Jazz/Blues on the weekend.
824	0	a	The food was good, the music was entertaining, but the service was really horrible.  The bartender was waiting our table - he forgot our food order, then brought us only part of the food we ordered, and didn't check back with us for our drinks. \n\nI was surprised how bad the service was, considering the rave reviews for the food.\n\nBeware if you order chicken by the piece.  Each piece costs $3.  Seriously, it is $3 PER PIECE for a wing, a leg, or a thigh.
825	0	a	"I was excited to try this place, a new neighborhood BBQ joint.  I figured they must have a great signature seasoning/dry rub or maybe a great sauce - neither was the case. Disappointing.  \n\nWhen I walked in I thought I was entering a bar, since thats all you see at the entrance.  Then I looked over and saw the tables set up in a dining area.  I was greeted by a nice gentleman and he seated me quickly.  Good start, unfortunately it went downhill from there.  Eventually, my server wandered over to my table and took my drink order. I had been waiting a while so I already knew what I wanted to order, but ordering would have to wait.  \n\nI figured I'd try the ribs to experience whatever Stacy's claim to fame would be.  When the server finally came back, (there were only 3 other tables being served besides mine) I asked her how many ribs come with the half slab.  She looked confused and said \""it depends.\"" It depends?  Really?  I ultimately ordered the half slab ($14 and no side items come with that, BTW) and waited anxiously.  And waited.  (Guys, your ribs are already cooked, it shouldn't take a long time to get a half slab out.)\n\nWhen my dinner finally arrived, I found out that a half slab is 6 ribs (over $2 per rib - and no sides, remember?) - not a great deal, but that's fine if they taste good.  I will say, the ribs seemed to be good quality.  They weren't too fatty and you could definitely taste the smoked flavor.  That's where the positives end.  There was no great seasoning or dry rub.  So I tried the sauce - maybe that's where I'd be wow'd. Nope.  It wasn't bad, but nothing special. Tasted like a grocery store sauce.\n\nI finished my 6 ribs with no sides and waited again.  My server never even checked back with me.  When she finally came back I handed her a $20 and couldn't wait to leave.  My total bill was over $18 for 6 ribs and a soda.  That's seems a bit high for a \""nice restaurant\"" much less a neighborhood place like Stacy's.  To be fair, I could have ordered side items at $3+ each - so I guess I could have paid even more and been slightly more satisfied.\n\nBottom line - I only tried one entree so I can't judge the entire menu, but I don't think I will be back to try the rest.  The food was average at best, and the value wasn't there.  If the service was better, I probably would have given 3 stars, but this server basically treated me as a burden rather than a customer.  Disappointing."
826	1	a	This was very special. It is hard to find a truly great Tres Leches in the states, so you cannot leave here without dessert. It melted on your mouth, and the cake was so tender while the cream decorations were real whipped heavy cream, the cake touched with little flecks of temptations.\nYes, we did actually eat a meal :). I had the Salmon topped with a compote of Tomatoes that was flavorful and piquant. It was accompanied by Grilled Veggies.\nMy BFFs also had imaginative and mouth watering entrees. I loved the Malbec. The redecoration of the former 'Brixxs' location includes beautiful dark wood and very private booths as well as an expanded outdoor patio area. A simply wonderful experience!!!
827	1	a	"This place is a gem! Friendly staff and great environment. Their new location is bigger and better than ever. \n\nSo we usually cant leave town without having the best \""tres Leches\"" everrrr!\n\nDefinitely recommend visiting their dessert menu and happy Dining."
828	1	a	Your Mom's Donuts is THE place to get your donut fix.  My brother, sister and I had our pick of 5-6 different flavors and went with the chocolate ganache.  It was a hard choice!  However, this donut was the most delicious donut I've ever had the pleasure to consume.  I will definitely be coming back and I will be bringing my husband along, too!
829	1	a	Had to try them -- after so many years in Charlotte with a dearth of quality donuts. Verdict? They taste wholesome, insofar as a donut can. The raised dough is a good texture, the chocolate on the chocolate donuts is super-chocolatey. The salted caramel was actually a little more salty than caramel-y. That said, I might just be getting too old for foods like this, because I ate two donuts and felt like I might really have damaged myself. They're big, be warned. Would (cautiously) eat again, though!
830	1	a	The Mrs. and I decided to stop in at this new Donut shop this morning. \n\nYour Mom's Donuts is in the old Carbones Pizza and Wings Tavern location on Monroe Rd. The first thing you notice when you enter the shop is how large the place is then you see the large chalkboard behind the counter. Once inside we met the co-owners Benjamin and Courtney.\n\nBenjamin greeted us and told us about their flavors of the week (all of which are posted on their website). I get the feeling Benjamin likes to talk. I mean that in a good way, honestly. Both were very engaging and seemed incredibly nice.  The business started as a donut delivery service and opened their first storefront early this Summer.\n\nEnough about the owners, you are here for a donut review right? Well, the donuts are delicious, which may be an understatement, but it is the plain truth.\n\nThey offer six different flavors which change weekly. We tried four of the six varieties. They were all quite good. I won't review the flavors because they will change weekly. The donuts are made from a brioche dough which is quite rich and melts in your mouth. Start with one at a time they will fill you up quickly. All of the donuts are made from mostly local products (flour, eggs, fruits, etc.)\n\nThe coffee is also quite good and from a local Charlotte roaster. We had the medium roast that he ground and brewed for us while we waited. The roast was quite pleasant. Not burnt like so many other coffee houses.  \n\nI admire their commitment to local merchants, growers, and suppliers. They have a delicious product that fills the gourmet donut niche in Charlotte/Matthews.\n\nLastly, the irony is that these are NOT your Mom's donuts!
831	1	a	We were in the neighborhood and decided to stop and grab some grub.  It was our first time there and we loved the atmosphere and on the tables there are happy cards and unhappy cards. Every restaurant should have this!  If it's your fist time there, you get a free muffin and it was delicious.  The food was good but they need to offer a military discount. We only had to flip the card once because they kept forgetting to bring our refills after we asked, but other than that it was a home-like feel and good cooking. Also the location in Summerlin is a very good location and a very beautiful area.
832	1	a	Went here for breakfast and as the reviews state the food was very good and the service was also excellent.  I Like the Omlette House on Charleston for Corned Beef Hash, but the service, atmosphere, and food makes this now my first choice.  Can't compare the cornbeef hash as I have not had it at Egg Works, but my Chile Omlette was excellent.  \n\nWon't disappoint.
833	1	a	Our random 'pajama party' Sunday breakfast was better than expected, begining at the door; our awesome server, Amanda,  recognized that we too were awesome when we came in PJ's, slippers and all.  She scooped us up, sat us in her section, tolerated my excessive pickiness and delivered us delicious breakfast perfection.   We thoroughly enjoyed her humor, bright personality, and clever ways. Such a delight to have such sparkling service early in the a.m.
834	1	a	This is a new shop that replaced the old Belmont Soda Shop. It has been beautifully remodeled by new owners. They are very friendly. They offer ice cream, shakes, malts, hand-stirred sodas, floats as well as sandwiches and hot dogs. We had a butter pecan ice cream cone and a chocolate malt (which was huge!) for about $8. It was really good. There's also old style glass sodas and classic candies for sale. The place is super cute, we're really glad to have this on Belmont's Main Street!\n\nAlso, my understanding is that they restored the original soda taps and ice cream dipping cabinets from the 1950s. The building is from the very early 1900s and the shop has exposed brick and wood beams. They've maintained the vintage feel, it's worth checking out for that reason alone.
835	1	a	I always feel right at home at Parking in front of Aaron's. I actually prefer it to parking in front of my own home, even though it is a several block walk. Whenever I need a parking spot in The Coronado, this is my 'go to' place.
836	1	a	Parking in front of Aaron's is so wonderful. The valet is always helpful and the new reservation system divine. Giving customers a beer and a photo shoot was a genius touch. Why park anywhere else?
837	0	a	The parking itself was lovely but the proprietor was honestly kind of a dick about it. Something about not being there to see him?
838	1	a	It's so busy,  it's hard to get in. So I suggest making reservations a week in advance! Best experience in that part of town. Even though the proprietor was an a hole in so many ways I appreciated the ambiance,  the view is to die for and I like a holes any way so 5 stars all the way. So go get your parking on!
839	1	a	"Take a trip to Mt Lebanon and stop in at the most amazing, authentic and visually appealing Chinese Food Experience that you will ever enjoy.\n\nJade Grill has brought Authentic Chinese Dishes to Pittsburgh.  You won't fine General Tso or Hunan Beef...what you will find is appetizers such as Pickled Vegetables, Lamb & Chicken Skewers, Hand Made (at time of order) Steamed Dumplings and much more.  For meals, you can choose from Soups that include 40 feet of hand pulled noodles (and if you don't believe it, ask to watch), Entrees that can include, Beef, Chicken, Lamb, Shrimp or Seafood.  And so much more.\n\nI opted for the Dry Pot...This was so amazing...it was full of a mix of flavors and then the heat...oh the heat.  Not for the faint of heart but I have to tell you, the burn does go away and you are left with the need to go back in for more.\n\nPart of me doesn't want to expose this incredible gem hidden on RT 19, but the reality is that I want everyone to go away with satisfaction that I have right now....and I am already planning my next visit.\n\nThank you so much Jade Grill for opening my eyes to \""real\"" Chinese cuisine."
840	0	a	"I would try Jade Grille again, just for the Pad Thai.\n\nThere were only two other tables seated when we walked in at 6:15ish.  The place looks great, but the servers aren't well trained and the hostess looked like she wanted to be anywhere else.  We were seated and given menus that weren't the same.  Got two \""updated menus\"" after asking which one was the right one to be using.  Ordered food.  Asked that my two small plates be served with my husband's dinner. Got my Szechuan Spring Roll in like 5 minutes.  It was hot, and crunchy, that's it.  No flavor, no nothing, even with the duck sauce.  The other small plate I ordered came with my husband's Pad Thai. The Ocean Roll was described as cucumber, tuna, and salmon wrapped in cucumber. What I was served was faux crab, avocado, tuna and salmon wrapped in cucumber.  I do not like the first two things I just listed, and had they been in the description, I would not have ordered the dish. They did make me a new order with just the cucumber, tuna and salmon, which was good.  The highlight of the meal though was the Pad Thai!!  We ended up sharing the Pad Thai.  When the bill came, the amount we were charged was different from the menu price, and we were told \""Oh, I'll let them know about it.\"" but the price wasn't changed on the bill.  Overall, I think they are suffering from \""new restaurant\"" issues and I would be willing to go back in a few months and give them an other try."
841	0	a	My daughter and I had the beef fried rice and the Pad Thai, respectively. Both were dry and rather tasteless. Mine was allegedly Veggie Pad Thai, but there were only four small pieces of broccoli, a handful of onions, and some chives. I will give them another try, but was quite disappointed this time.
842	1	a	The food was pretty good! The pad Thai was a bit vinegary, but that was the first time I had it, so I'm not sure how it's supposed to be. I got the jade grill hot pot. The flavones weren't complex but they were yummy and satisfying. Both meals were big enough to share!
843	0	a	"The dumplings were amazing, but nothing else I ordered seemed too special. The food was fine, I just expected more for the price and after having the stellar dumplings as an appetizer. The service is what I found lacking. For some reason, the hostess took our main course order, which is fine, but my order was incorrect. (I ordered an entree and was brought out a 1/2 cup bowl of soup) No big deal, I was fine to wait another 10 minutes for my food, but I was shocked that not one of the 4 people that interacted with me about the mishap ever offered any sort of apology (Not the waitress, the hostess, the food busser, or the other person that came out from the kitchen to double check that they got it right the second time, in fact I kinda felt like they tried to convince me that I messed up and I DID actually order a teeny bowl of soup for my entree.) Usually when an order gets screwed up, a good restaurant wont charge you for that item, or they will take one of your drinks off the bill. Not only did that not happen, I wasn't even given a simple apology, so I think they need to work on their customer service standards. Oh, and also, we overheard one waitress say to another \""Im gonna kill someone\"" as she was walking away from another table. I understand working in the service industry can make you want to kill people, but really, save that talk for the kitchen."
844	1	a	When I first saw that the Jade Grille was opening in my home town, I have to say I was a little skeptical.  I thought that by the look of the front and the font of the sign that this was a lower class general asian cuisine restaurant.  I was pleasantly surprised!\n\nI went in on a Sunday evening and was lucky enough to notice the buy one skewer or sushi roll get one half off promotion.  I believe it goes from 4 or 4:30 to 6:30ish but I could be mistaken.  My mother and I decided to try it.\n\nThe inside was lovely and clean and the hostess and bartender (as we sat at the bar for the promotion) were both very friendly.  \n\nWe ordered two soups, two skewers, and two sushi rolls.  My mother thoroughly enjoyed the Seafood Hot & Sour soup and I ordered the Crab Asparagus soup which was delightful.  Often you find with crab or lobster soups that you can hardly taste the meat or that there's very little meat to begin with but this was not the case in my experience.  It was hot and had a perfect amount of sliced asparagus and crab meat and both flavors were very prevalent.\n\nThe skewers we ordered were the bacon covered quail eggs and the fish with miso and kabakayi sauce.  The fish was good and we finished the piece very quickly but quail eggs are my personal favorite.  I would recommend these soft boiled bacon wrapped balls of heaven to anyone!\n\nI believe the two sushi rolls we ordered were the Crazy Gaga Roll and the Jade Roll though I could be wrong as they don't have descriptions on the website.  They were both good; one was wrapped with a thin crepe ad the other was topped with jalape\u00f1o slices.  The jalape\u00f1o one had fish and avocado on top and, although it was very tasty, the avocado had turned brown already and wasn't as appealing to look at.\n\nWithout drinks and with what we ordered, our total came to about $50 before the promotion was added which got us to about $35 after tax.  So while it was tasty and the atmosphere was nice, it was still a bit pricey.  I certainly won't be buying drinks with my meals at least.  But overall I was well fed and very happy with my first experience with the Jade Grille.
845	0	a	Sort of a disappointing experience. I came here with 4 others on a Friday night around 7pm. with reservations and the place didn't  appear to look like it was very bust so I can only guess that the  poor service experience we had was attributed to short handed staffing??? Who knows??? Our server did a decent job but we received each item and very long intervals. They gave us a dish that was obviously not ours and the server took it back and we  waited such a long time that we simply told her that we didn't want it. It actually still  arrived and they boxed it up for us but gave it to us on the house which was  nice. I thought that the food was alright but certainly not worth what we paid for  it. 3 Shoshito peppers for around 9$. That's a little steep considering you can buy a pound for that price and I could certainly cook them better than these. I don't think I'll be back anytime soon.
846	1	a	Finally got a chance to go, after the word had spread among all my friends that there was a new Chinese restaurant opened. It was very clean, nice decor, Good service. Well most importantly, we were happy about the Sichuan cuisine there.
847	1	a	Outstanding.  Try the sweet peppers appetizer.  Best restaurant in my. Leno by far.  Great atmosphere as well.
848	0	a	"*****UPDATE: 01-06-2015*****\nAfter The review was posted, Bridgette wanted to work with me and my sister. We got in store credit, and we are very pleased! ;-) ... \""we are reviewing our exchange policy\""... they said. I hope they do. \nOriginal Review:\nWhat a cute little store!! I said... Until her nasty customer service came in the picture... So If you want Overprice home decor, and crappy customer service, this is the place. I begged and explained (nothing that I bought was either seasonal or on sale) please let me buy paint, brushes, or let's use the credit $ for the workshop or something, the answer was NO.  I said, maybe you should be a little bit more considerate with your policy on \""home decor exchanges) just IN STORE CREDIT, the woman there said \""We have a lot of customers, we don't need more\"" seriously?? You don't need more customers uh? Well, then I'll make sure naive people like me, find this review and save them the hassle."
849	1	a	The Manhattan sandwich was fresh and spectacular!  The potato salad was rich and delicious,  while the couscous was playful and light.  The quiche was perfect.  Great draft beers and the service was friendly and helpful. \n\nThank you!
850	1	a	"Blink and you might miss ThirdSpace. A cool (beer-wine only) bar on the corner of Grand Ave and 11th Avenue, I've driven past it every day but hadn't stopped in until this past weekend.\n\nA warm welcome awaits from the friendly bartender through a window that serves the outside patio. The weather was co-operating so we sat outside in the early evening and enjoyed the surroundings. The outside area, surrounded by quaint little shops and trees give it a New Orleans courtyard kind of feel. Citronella candles had been placed to deter the blood-sucking insects, and that was most appreciated. \n\nThe beer selection was impressive, recited filibuster-style by the bartender. They even had $2 PBRs and High Life to cater to the Hipsters. Didn't have an opportunity to try the food, but it gets good reviews here, so I'll come back for that soon.\n\nAs we were leaving a band was setting up for the evening, kinda looked like Wilson Phillips, but I didn't \""Hold On\"" to hear them...."
851	1	a	Great Greek food. The gyro platter was delicious, meat was tender and well seasoned, great salad and the lentil soup was tasty.  Definitely a new central phx favorite. Must try
852	1	a	"You Always Were My Gyro.....\n\nContent Warning!!! Boring Story first paragraphs, MG facts at bottom.\n\nThe first ingredients for the stew of my life were New York, Oklahoma, Missouri and Arkansas flavored Anglo-German, Italian and Mexican.  The Greek influence was flipping burgers and broiling dogs at Beverly and Rampart, so that doesn't count.\n\nWhen I hit New York at the age of 18 I was taking home $50 a month, room and board provided. Meals in town were usually a slice of dollar pizza or a hot dog from a stand near the Governor's Island Ferry.  Late one evening in central Manhattan I stumbled across a sidewalk Greek place, literally a large window flanked by signs advertising several fast foods.  One of them Gyro.  Affordable Gyro, maybe a buck-fifty. My sophistication meter has been just off zero my whole life.  Food.  In budget.  A word I'd seen before.  Did I order Hero or Gye-ro? Hero or jy-ro?  Hero or jai-ro?\n\nAlways check the first box touched by intuition.  Of course I did not.  \""Please may I have a Gye-ro?\"" And that is how you make tired Greek cooks explode with laughter late at night in New York City. But I got my gyro. I've never mispronounced THAT word since. \n\nGyro, souvlaki, Shawarma, D\u00f6ner Kebab, D\u00f6ner, Gye-ro.  Call it what you will, it is some kind of meat sliced from a drum of meat rotating on giant, grilling skewer.  Sliced onto pita, drizzled with tzaziki sauce and served fresh and hot, it is good.  It's also excellent in salads and other dishes.  \n\n/**\n\nMika's has been at 503 W. Thomas a few months.  It looked very nice inside, there's a guy dancing on the corner with a $5 Gyro sign, and the hours surpass many other eateries for several blocks.  I gave them a try.  A $5 gyro, Greek salad, glass of water.  Plus tip, about $8.00.  \n\nThe pita was generously filled to bursting with gyro meat. The meat was moist and fresh, no dried edges.  The salad was fresh with feta crumbles, an olive and a tangy dressing.  The most generous gyro lunch I've ever consumed.  \n\nStarters and entrees range from $3.95 to $12.95.  If I bought the $13 platter, I'd be sharing or taking half home.  You can read the menu on the web page.  I'll hint here there are falafel, dolma, hummus, gyro, variations on those themes plus several sandwiches.  \n\nVisit Worthy, Meal Worthy."
853	1	a	This is a calorie friendly food truck. I had an amazing turkey pesto panini for lunch. It was so filling and satisfying. Everyone raved about the mini keylime pies. That will be my next mission of sabotage.  Give it a try if they arrive at your next event!
854	0	a	Was excited to visit Devanna Love, Its important to patronize Black establishments...I do have to say my 1st experience wasn't so good, When I entered the store I didn't see anyone, then after a few minutes a young lady stuck her head out of the dressing room and said hello, I thought she was a customer since she was trying on clothes during regular business hours, Nor was she very friendly. Customer service is the main KEY to a successful business.
855	0	a	Horrible service.   The girl working the front just doesn't care devanna.  She didn't greet us nor help with anything.  WE greeted her.  She was too busy on the iPad checking her facebook or Instagram.  Hopefully she was on here reading the comments.  Anyway devanna.  You need to invest into new employees
856	0	a	What happened???? Great new store but the service is terrible! I would rather have a smaller store and the great happy people that used to be there. Witnessed a manager, or someone who looked like a manager, yelling at staff but wasn't available to help me. I shouldn't have to explain to my daughter why the lady is yelling at the other lady. Not okay!!!! Will be shopping online or probably elsewhere. Get it together management.
857	0	a	I have to agree with the other reviewer. Pb normally has excellent customer service but this store has none. I have gone there twice now to purchase a glider for my nursery, first time I couldn't get anyone to assist me even after I tracked someone down, the second time I returned to give it another shot the sales associate knew nothing about the products and couldn't tell me what style it was that they had on display, I asked if there was someone with who was familiar with the products to assist me and there wasn't. When you are spending a good amount on some furniture you want to make sure your questions are answered and you are ordering the right items, I guess I'll have to find somewhere else to purchase from.
858	1	a	As a new Mom-to-be, it can be pretty overwhelming walking into a baby store for the first time, especially when the store has as many adorable products as PB Kids. Luckily I had my sister and Megan, the lovely nursery Manager to guide my frazzled mind! I found the customer service here to be pretty excellent, even when they were overrun with a influx of customers all at once. The staff did a great job getting me set up, answering my questions and guiding me through the store. The store itself is beautiful and filled with so many finds, it could really hurt your pocket book! It's Christmas time and so they had so many adorable decorations. I held back from buying one of everything! I really like this new store and I think I will be frequenting this shop quite often in the next several months. The only downfall was that many of the products were missing a barcode so instead of scanning products, I had to keep grabbing an associate to manually add it. Luckily they were right there to assist!
859	0	a	"Would it kill the employees to smile? Every time I go here I leave upset. One time I had to wait 25 min. For them to check the measurements of something and I didn't even ask about measurements, it wasn't a big deal for me. Did I mention I had given birth four days earlier? So pissed. Today, I pick up my boopy cover I had them redo since the embroidery thread was unraveling. My mother picks it up for me and the lady says, \""Well, I wasn't going to touch it with bodily fluid so I just gave you a new one.\"" Thanks witch. When I brought it in I said I didn't want to wash it and ruin my washer- the thread was really unraveling. I hate this one location. In this day in age when online shopping is the norm, you would think the manager or the corporation would get on their staff. Just treat your customers like decent human beings."
860	1	a	"I really enjoy shopping at Sprouts! I was there opening day and decided to come back again this evening. All of the employees were friendly and each of my check out experiences went quickly! Sprouts offers a pretty decent selection of vegan/vegetarian and gluten free products at low prices. That alone is exciting! But I also love how they label each individual fruit and vegetable with a sticker if they're organic! I came across a few fruits/veggies I've never heard of before. I ended up buying \""witch finger\"" grapes. They're pretty amazing..tasty flavor almost like a red grape with an interesting texture and crazy looking shape! They have a lot of beauty and health products too, which I love browsing at. I will definitely return soon :) \n\n*I was #61 in line on opening day and received a 20% off coupon which was great to use! I needed up saving about $10! Thanks Sprouts!! The free reusable grocery bag was a cute touch too!"
861	1	a	I've been waiting for another option to come to the area and it's here.  Sprouts opened two days ago and I stopped today.  As someone else noted in their review, the staff was amazing!  They were so helpful and cheery.  Let's hope that continues.\n\nI basically strolled around and looked at a lot for future reference.  I also bought more than I thought I would when I went there.  There was a nice selection of packaged Indian foods and I got several of these.  I won't have to drive to the Indian market to get some of this in the future and there was some items I've never seen before.\n\nI also looked at the meat section.  The steaks are huge--NY strips big enough to feed two or more.\n\nEven though the story was very busy with people like me checking it out, it was easy to navigate the smaller store without crashing carts.\n\nI am a fan and I'll be stopping more often.  It's only about a mile from home!  Welcome to the neighborhood, Sprouts!
862	1	a	Sprouts is a grocery store with lots of organic products, fresh vegetables and fruits. Sometimes you can get something really good for a nice price. Very friendly and helpful stuff, big parking lot. \n\nI like Sprouts. Thank you for opening in this area!
863	1	a	Great place to go great choices and prices. I like the new location
864	1	a	Sprouts is just about the best market in town.  Fresh produce.  Good sales.  They take coupons.  The staff is super friendly.  The place is clean.   I love the place in every way.
865	1	a	After hearing about its long awaited grand opening here in Summerlin, I finally made it out to Sprouts today for the first time ever....and IT WAS AWESOME!!!!!!!!!!\n\nSo many organic options, fresh and affordable produce, a nice selection of meats/seafood, and not overpowering. The layout of the market makes perfect sense and is easy to navigate. It's the best of both farmers' markets + a grocery store :)\n\nMy only gripe would be that they don't have a particularly good freezer selection (but I guess you don't come to Sprouts to buy cheap-o freezer foods...). I'm sure once Home Goods & TJ Maxx open up next door, this strip mall is going to get insanely packed, so go now before the crowds :)
866	1	a	I have been here 4x in a month since this new location opened up. I love it here! For all you parents out there, they carry emergen-c for kids!
867	1	a	The new Sprouts on Sahara and Hualapi is a great store.  All fresh and good prices.
868	1	a	Great for produce and Boar's Head cold cuts. Small supermarket but has some great deals on much of their items. Not a fan of there bread but their produce is always fresh.
869	0	a	With the exception of the rude checkout woman who rolled her eyes at me because I hadn't marked my bulk foods correctly (I was new to the process, give me a break), said nothing of any sort of greeting, not even a hello. If you're that miserable, find a new  job, seriously. \nWith that aside, the store itself is okay. Don't get me wrong, I love Sprouts...just not this location. I like the one on Rainbow/Flamingo better, honestly. I don't know why, maybe it's the layout or something, plus that one seems to have better bulk food items and just a better selection overall. One annoying thing is you can hear their checkout registers beeping clear to the back of the store...turn them things down!
870	1	a	Friendly staff, great prices, clean environment. Come on Wednesday for double ad day.  Being your own bags to save 5 cents ea.
871	1	a	"As I walked in to what I thought was gonna be another cliche burger place I was pleasantly surprised at what I saw. There was old fashion burger place style integrated with a contemporary design, a very warm welcome. \n\nThe burgers look great and taste great. Their fries are better then others, you can tell by the taste. \n\nThey have a bunch of dipping sauces to choose from. They have your regular ketchup and a marshmallow sauce for those inclined. \n\nIt's a casual vibe and the staff treats you like friends. When our server brought out our food he said \"" shits boom dude\"". I'm sure his boss wouldn't like hearing that but I found it funny and comforting. \n\nGreat atmosphere. Great fries. Great burger"
872	1	a	Pleasantly surprised! The service was great, very accommodating. They added turkey chili to my husband's burger free of charge. I had the veggie Greek with feta, roasted red peppers, cucumbers, lettuce & tomato....delish! Sweet potato fries were really good and a large variety of dipping sauces. Good selection of craft beers & fresh milkshakes as well. The menu also includes salads, chicken, hot dogs,  shrimp & Ahi burgers. Great addition to the neighborhood!
873	1	a	They recently opened up and had a nice energy about the place.  And they had plenty of people working the floor and counter.  The burger is custom made to your order.  The french fries were really good and presented well.  They do not rush you so you can sit and chat with your friends for a while.  Wishing them success.
874	1	a	First time i tasted seafood burger,it was excellent, i enjoyed very much i will definitively go again.
875	0	a	Nothing, and i mean nothing is special about this place.  At best the Burgers are absolutely ordinary.  From the outside looking in, it has curb appeal but step inside and all that goes away.  With less than 25 people there for lunch it was sooooooooo loud i couldn't stand it!  I'm sure the only reason to go here is because you'll never have to wait in line. There are dozens of better places to have burgers in Scottsdale.
876	0	a	I ordered the Skinny Turkey Burger.  The worst Turkey Burger I have ever had.  It was dense, dry and without flavor.  The lettuce and tomato were sparse at best.
877	1	a	We found this place last night thanks to Yelp (and my sis-in-law's review).  My husband really wanted a burger, but I could not stomach the thought of drive-thru.  After a quick review of the places near us, we bit the bullet and tried something new.  We ordered take out so I can't comment on the restaurant since I sent the Hubs to pick it up.  I did, however, call in the order. The guy on the phone was very nice.  I did almost have a heart attack when he said it was going to be $27 for 2 burgers and fries. Let me tell you, after sampling the fare, TOTALLY worth the price!!\n\nI ordered the Chicken Parmesan chicken burger with Cheddar & Ale fries. OMG, delish!!  The chicken burger was perfectly seasoned and cooked, the flavor of the marinara and parmesan crisp mingled so well with it, and the brioche bun was light and flavorful. An excellent combination. Then the Cheddar & Ale fries were a delight. The fries by themselves were great. But the sauce was even better. My husband loved the fries but was not a fan of the Cheddar & Ale sauce, but he hates alcohol and it has a very beer finish (as it should since Ale is in the title).  So if you don't like alcohol, I don't recommend it.\n\nHe ordered the OMG burger and OMG he thought it was great. He usually can power through a double burger just about anywhere, but this was so big he couldn't finish. Unless you haven't eaten all day, the result may be the same for you. He recommends just get 1 patty and will do that in the future. But the flavor was great and it was perfectly cooked.\n\nI wish I had tried a shake. The Creme Brulee shake sounded terrific, but I will be sure to try it on our next visit.
878	0	a	Pretty hip spot for a burger joint, but overall cool.\n\nI came with my 2 sisters to check this place out.  Overall, the place reminds me of a Smashburger, but unfortunately without a smash!  I ordered the Bacon Cheese burger while my sisters order the cheesy 4 pack and the Cinco burger.  The Cinco burger came with jalapenos, gaucamole, salsa, jack cheese, your burger fixings on a sesame bun.  Overall, a good looking burger and my sister was delighted.  I'm a bacon burger snob!  Mines came with the fixings, applewood bacon, american cheese on a brioche bun.  In the end, I thought it was good, but nothing really stood out for me.  I guess what's really cool about this place is the sauces available to your choosing; Thai ketchup, toasted marshmellows, Ragin Cajun, Apple Cider, etc.  \n\nThe place itself pushes for a modern flare with a young vibrant service crowd.  In the end, it's a cool place to hangout, but didn't really captivate me! - Enjoy!
879	0	a	It fails to amaze me how crappy service can be...\n\nHow difficult is it to remember to put the gluten free bun ON THE SIDE and to ADD fries to the order?  I mean really....  I guess it's my fault because I didn't look on the bag...  I'll make sure to do that if I ever return.
880	0	a	"Not going back. Went in on a Sunday at 3pm to get take out. Waited what seemed like a long \""10 minutes\"" for nobody to be in there at the time. Drove 5 minutes home. Turkey burger looked like a McDonalds chicken nugget and had wilted lettuce. Tasted ok but nothing great. Got the mixed fries. They were nearly cold and getting mushy. The regular fries tasted like cardboard. I even spit one out that was just pure cold grease. Sweet potato fries were too thin. I would guess they made the fries first and then the burgers took awhile longer so we ended up with cold fries when we got home. Not sure this place will last if they don't improve!"
881	0	a	"Tried to post a photo but can't figure out how.  We ordered two chili cheese dogs. You would expect that to be smothered in chili, right?  Um, nope.  I think I count 5 beans/meat total!  Called the manager as it was take out and she said \""what would you like me to do\""?  Oh, I don't know, offer a gift card for the value or something.  Epic failure!"
882	0	a	"I wish I could review the food, but was completely unable to get service Saturday night, Dec. 13. My husband and I came in Saturday night after visiting the Railroad Park's holiday lights with family. We simply wanted hot chocolate that was marked as a special with signs on the front doors. There was one table full of customers eating, three teenage boys at the bar and at the other end of the bar two teenage girls. The girls had their shakes already and the only employee on the floor was chatting with them. My husband and I sat on the end of the bar near the teenage boys...waited a few minutes, weren't acknowledged or glanced at as the conversation continued at the other end of the bar. After a few more minutes, my husband decided to use the restroom while I placed the order...hopefully a quick to go order. Two other teenage male servers and an older adult male server or worker came out. One brought one shake to the 3 teen boys next to me, who then asked where their other two shakes were to the confusion of the server. None of the 4 employees glanced at me, acknowledged me, or asked why I might even be there after about 10 minutes (conversation going strong between the one teen server and teen girl customers still.) My husband returned from the bathroom, we waited some more & I said, well, \""Maybe we should just leave.\"" One of the teen boys sitting next to us said, \""That sounds like a good idea.\"" He and his friends were also upset at their lack of service. The trio of teen boys still hadn't received their missing 2 shakes and no worker had ever acknowledged our presence, with only one table filled with 3 customers. The only customers getting attention were those that the workers seemed to want to flirt with. As my husband and I walked out after being ignored for roughly 15 minutes, I started to ask for a manager, but my husband said forget it, it's not even worth it. Hope somebody else gets service, not better service, just service."
883	1	a	On Sundays, they're open at 12PM, but when I got there around 12:15PM the store was still closed. I live in the southeast side of town and I didn't want to waste the gas so me and my sisters just waited a bit to see if anyone would open the store. Luckily the owners came a bit after. Not a big deal to me. \n\nThe lady who helped me out was very kind to me. I liked how she asked if it was okay if she could put astringent. This is very important to me since I have very sensitive skin. For some reason, the threading didn't hurt as much here, but I'm not complaining!\n\nOther than the little mishap about the store opening, I was satisfied with my experience here~
884	1	a	I just got my eyebrows done and this place was great! It was clean and beautiful. She did a great job on my eyebrows and was done within a few minutes. Quick and painless. I will be back!
885	1	a	Harita is seriously the best! I was so upset today coming from another eyebrow threading salon (5 stars on Yelp) where they messed up my eyebrows, making them super uneven and thin. I Yelped for another place in hopes of getting it fixed and I am so glad to say that Divine Threading will be my go-to threading place in the future. Harita reassured me and worked her magic on my brows, not only fixing and evening them but perfected them better than any other place I've been to in Las Vegas. She is amazing!! In the end, she asked for nothing but a Yelp review and I created this account just for her. Also must I add, the salon design is super clean and chic; the pictures don't do it justice! Thank you Harita!
886	1	a	I had to call these guys for a quick service call.\nUsed them to repair garage door for a rental property.  They could have easily told me to replace the entire door, however, they said it could be simply repaired saving me a lot of money.  They showed up to the property on time and made the repairs.  Paid the exact amount quoted.  Honest, professional, competitive price....highly recommended.
887	1	a	Fun place! Glow putt is an awesome idea with a unique spin on mini putt. Also, it's indoors which is nice for living in Arizona. Great atmosphere inside with music, colors, and black lights. Owner was very friendly too. Had a great time here!
888	0	a	Simple, claustrophobic and overpriced. The place looks very cheaply put together. Courses are very simple.The putting holes are just plywood sprayed with glow in the dark paint. It's a neat idea and place but the holes are really close together. It's pretty claustrophobic. But we got a hole in one at the last hole and got a free round of golf. It was hot in there too.
889	1	a	Way cooler than being in the heat, awesome time. My only complaint is that its small, so if its busy your waiting 10 mins per hole. However seriously it didn't matter, tons of fun.
890	1	a	Wonderful family friendly atmosphere. Affordable prices and super clean bathrooms! Not too busy and the kids had a blast with the glow in dark colors.
891	1	a	"What a great concept for mini golf. My wife and I came here for a random date night. When we decided on this place we had no idea of what to expect but thought the concept was fun.\n\nAs soon as you enter, you're welcomed with neon lights everywhere. To start off, they give you a glow in the dark bracelet and you pick a glow in the dark putter. Every few holes, there are benches where you can \""recharge\"" your glow in the dark golf balls. \n\nThe holes aren't too difficult but it's the atmosphere that makes it enticing. Also, if you get a hole in one on the 18th hole you get a prize.\n\nMy wife and I are definitely coming back and we're bringing friends with us next time"
892	1	a	We LOVED this place!!!!! Celebrated my son's 14th bday with siblings, cousins and even grandparents and ALL (ages 8-75!) had a GREAT time! Lots of laughter and memories made. This place is very CLEAN, well run, had fund holes and cover contraptions throughout the course, well organized, and fun establishment! Wish we lived closer and we would go all the time. We were in town for the holidays. My kids cannot WAIT to go back. Thank you!
893	1	a	We liked Glow Putt so much we went back the very next day. They've been open about 5 months, and the concept is awesome. I may be dating myself but this is mini-Golf meets Tron. They took poorly performing unproductive retail space, painted some wood to glow in the dark, added fluorescent lighting (to charge the paint after hours), some black lights and some imagination and voila, we have glow in the dark mini golf. It is dark enough to appreciate the concept but still bright enough to see your way around. My 7 year old and 5 year old both loved it, as did the rest of the family. The owners thought of everything - even the scorecard on the mini-clipboard glows, and it hangs from a lanyard around your neck. You get a glowing bracelet, and the clubs and balls glow too. The cost is reasonable, and the owner and staff are all super nice. The holes are much more simple than at the more traditional mini golf venues around town - here there are no windmills, but you don't miss the bells, whistles and animation of the other places. My son loved to charge the ball every few holes, and especially on hole #17. The silly wheel to spin on #11 was a nice touch. 8 and 15 are deceptively simple and too short, but still challenging.  My favorite hole is 13 - I think that's the one with the pinball action where the ball drains to a lower level.  Glow putt is a great concept, and it is very well executed.
894	1	a	This is one of the very few places that I actually look forward to doing business with!  The staff is incredibly professional and the prices are very competitive. \n\nQuality of work here is remarkable.  I come about twice a week for my husband's work clothes for tailoring, dry cleaning and laundry.  The incredible associates at this store even call me on my cell to tell me when my items are done, as they know we are on an unusually tight schedule and have a limited supply of clothes.  (After trying two others in the area, this one beats them both.) They provide legendary service seldom experienced anymore.  It's a genuine pleasure to do business with these folks!\n\nAs a side note:  I greatly value that the store has none of the toxic chemicals blowing in my face like other places.  With the weak immune system I have, the cleanliness and fresh air of this place makes life a little more comfortable.
895	1	a	Id give more stars if possible! I love everything about this place.\n\nAs soon as I walked in, the shop is clean and there wasn't that over powering chemical smell that some cleaners have. The staff was super friendly and attentive.\n\nI took in dresses to be hemmed, a suit to be dry cleaned and a swimsuit project that another tailor had refused.\n\nThe suit dry cleaning was really straight forward, no problems there and a good job done.\n\nThe real wow-factor comes from their tailoring service. There are two great little dressing rooms with full length mirrors and definitely feels professional. The curtains give you plenty of privacy when trying clothing on to be fitted... and its super clean.\n\nI took 4 dresses to be hemmed and after trying on the first one, I could tell that the lady doing the measurements was a pro. Each dress was pinned quickly and she had it down!\n\nI took in 4 swimsuit tops which I expected to be turned away. I wanted to have each one either added a panel to give me more room or an entire bottom to a bikini so that it was a tankini. I had even tried to add panels into one of them myself and it ended up looking like Edward Scissors hands had done it. Needless to say, each turned out amazing and she was even able to fix my disaster. She even went to the fabric store to get the right materials! And when I say turned out amazing, its more like a magician. The detail and sizing was PERFECT.\n\nThe price was decent too. Very reasonable especially for the tailoring and attention to detail. \n\nTwo thumbs up! Highly recommended. Im telling everyone I know to check this place out.
896	1	a	Imagine a gigantic Home Goods / Pier 1 / World Market all rolled into one giant warehouse. Sound like heaven to you too? Then check this place out! It's worth the drive out to Arizona Mills to shop here. In fact, I think it's the only reason to go to the mall anymore. At Home is like a membership warehouse without a membership card or fee required.\n\nThis store is huge and well organized with spacious aisles. They sell everything from furniture, glassware and holiday decorations to rugs, curtains, vases and pillows. If you need something for your house, you should be able to find it here! The pillow selection alone is amazing (something for every style decor). If you need it you most likely will find it here -- as usual, I found plenty of things I didn't even KNOW I needed.\n\nCheck the in-store sales for even bigger discounts. I snagged a cool tabletop drum set ($19.99 retail) for $5.00!
897	1	a	"It's been a long time since I've had a real reason to frequent the mall until I walked through the At Home Superstore located at AZ  Mills Mall.  Though I was on a mission to get in and leave quick, I kept getting pulled in all kinds of direction while at the store.  Each aisle had something aesthetically pleasing to the eyes or had something that allures your sense of home decor.  I have to admit that I didn't get the same giddy, goosebump kinda feeling that I get when I walk into Home Goods but it's definitely not a hit or miss kinda of place.  It does have a warehouse feel to it, which mainly means it's overwhelmingly large and impersonal.  Nonetheless, you have to go in there with a game plan or you may end up spending more than your wallet can handle cause the cost of everything is reasonable.  And \""reasonable\"" can be costly. For a store of that magnitude, it was rather empty of crazy-saving shoppers.  I may frequent the mall more often now, but not enough to become a mall rat."
898	0	a	This is not a BBQ joint.  The hotlink sandwich tasted like a Bar S hotdog w/peppers.   The brisket I know had to be a day old & I am not talking about yesterday.   Don't waste your time.  I spent $15 for food that I just threw away.
899	0	a	I really wanted to like this place. My child and I were in the neighborhood & she was jonesing for some pulled pork bbq, so I came to Yelp. This place is right off the 51 near where we were and had high stars. It is very small & parking is in the back. Even my 9 year old was concerned since it wasn't much to look at but hey  Yelp seemed to think it was ok. So in we went.\n\nIt is very very small. Two men were inside watching the game. They thought I wanted take out but we wanted to be served. They seemed to be scramble to make that happen. The tables didn't seem very clean. We ordered lemonade & sweet tea, which were overly sweet.\n\nMy kid really wanted pulled pork BBQ so she ordered a sandwhich. It came with a side so she got coleslaw. I ordered a two meat platter with potato salad and mac & cheese. After 10 minutes the guy came back and said the pork wasn't cooked yet. I was very confused since usually that meat slow cooks for a really long time. So my kid changed her order to brisket, which I also ordered. The brisket was really chewy and didn't fall apart. My ribs were really good but a little too salty. My kid loved her sandwich, but they didn't bring her coleslaw. She had to go ask for it from them. The potato salad was runny as if it were copped into a bowl with water. The mac & cheese was good, though.\n\nI ordered some hot links to go. When I ate them later that evening they were thinly sliced instead of full links and were like you'd find at Circle K. Quality was just bad.\n\nWhen I went to pay the credit card machine did not work. I was about ready to just tell them I had no cash but I'm not that kinda guy. I happened to have $40 in my wallet so I paid in cash & left. I won't be back.
900	0	a	"No thanks. I ordered a brisket sandwich and I literally could not chew the \""meat\"". I'm from the Midwest, Kansas to be specific and I've had some excellent BBQ. This wasn't even edible! Don't waste your money!"
901	1	a	Just had pulled pork, delicious.  And the bbq sauce yiu can tell is homemade.  Very good, I will come back again. I want to try the mac'n'cheese
902	0	a	I might change my review IF I EVER GET TO EAT HERE!\n\nI have tried 3 times this month to try and eat at this establishment. \nThe first time I pulled in and found a note on the door stating they were closed do to a family emergency. \nOkay.. I understand that..\n\nThe second time they were open and had a pair of customers at a table inside. \nI approached the counter to order a couple of pounds of brisket. \nI was then informed that they were OUT OF BRISKET. Now this was lunch time. What restaurant runs out of brisket at lunch time with only a pair of customers? \nSo I left, deciding I'd give this place one last try.\n\nToday,  yes, New year's eve day, I tried again.  And once again,  there was a note on the door stating that the restaurant was closed until Jan. 2nd for vacation. \n\nNow I realize that everyone deserves a vacation. But it seems this place is either closed for some random reason or out of food..\n\nI guess i'll stick with either Waldo's for ribs or Texas bbq house for brisket. \n\nI don't know if i'll even bother trying to try this place again. .
903	0	a	The parking lot is a mess for starters.  We had to wait for a seat but that's expected on a Sunday morning.  We were then seated at a table in the very back directly across from the bathrooms...appetizing!  In all fairness she asked if that was ok but we were hungry and had our infant with us so we said ok- the point here is that there shouldn't be a table there to begin with! \n\nTook 10 min to get greeted and 20 min for our food.  Although busy, the allure of a diner is the quick service and cheap prices- which were NOT cheap!  It was nearly $9 for an omelet with any cheese and 2 choices of veggies or meat.  Each additional option was 50 cents.  If you wanted a western it was nearly $10! I think this is a lot compare to other diners like Toms in dormont.  \n\nAfter waiting for what felt like forever, the food was really good.  The turkey sausage was really salty though and they only gave a tiny cup of syrup for the pancake, which was luke warm.  \n\nWe might try this one more time but not for a while.  Let them work out the kinks!
904	0	a	ok, so its new and curiousity killed the cat.  Well in a nutshell this is as mediocre as it gets.  Low rent restaurant serving low rent food.  Bleeeaach!!\n\nHow did this place even get zoning approval with parking for 12 cars and the spaces were designed for Mini-Coopers.  What a mess.\n\nFor those of you familiar with the old Skidgys in Mt Lebanon which deservedly went out of business years ago, this is nothing more than a reincarnation only worse.  Eat'n Park would be a 4 star restaurant compared to this place, and I despise Eat'n Park, yuk! \n\nPortions are horrid, quality and service is below average, metal shavings and green pepper in the coleslaw, food is oily and greasy, 3 green beans a side dish does not make and the beans were raw-hardly cooked, even the rotating dessert case was completely unappetizing, basically I have nothing positive to offer or comment about this place.  DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME.
905	0	a	Parking is narrow, as another yelper previously wrote. The raisin French Toast was awesome according to\nMy daughter. My omelette consisted of burnt eggs. The coffee was warm, not hot. My husband gets the breakfast sandwich with ham, always, and the ham was like lunch meat, not the thick ham served at the Carnegie location. The inside is nice and new, but the food is much less to be desired. We will be going back to the Carnegie location from now on.
906	0	a	The place looks very trendy, hipsterish, and has great lighting and cool architecture. Sadly, food doesn't follow the ambiance there. \n\nFirst of all, Rose & Goji berries lemonade was too sweet. I had a medium (way too small) Japanese Ceasar salad (Yuzu dressing) with tuna. Only five pieces of seared tuna. Not even fresh. It looks like it just came out of the fridge. Classic burger was small but ok. The only positive thing with this recent dining experience was the poutine gravy and the service. Staff was friendly. \n\nOverall portions are very small and food is SO expensive. Def overpriced. \n\nConsidering the fact they just opened 3 months ago, I'm sure they can do better. I would recommend people to wait a while before trying that place but honestly, I wouldn't recommend it at all.
907	1	a	"Wow. Just wow. In town 4 days, dinner here twice and I'm PICKY about my food and drinks. \nThe cocktail menu's accessible-sounding drinks belie the deep complexity of these concoctions. I'd try anything with the booze of your choice. If Sam is your bartender, challenge him and you won't be disappointed - this is someone who takes pride in his craft and it shows. \nThe food is stellar. The chicken nuggets (yeah, I know!) are top notch and come with the best ranch I've had and one I wish I could have always. (This from a ranch-hater!!) Both the \""cheesesteak\"" and Chic Fillet are excellent, and the Thai popcorn has me trying to replicate the recipe at home. \n\nVery impressed with this newcomer -- from someone who usually reserves a first visit till after 6 months in operation. \n\nCan't wait to come back!"
908	0	a	Please avoid this place...the most horrible food ive ever tried and soo expensive! Almost threw up on my way out! Wongs place in tempe is the place to go! Real food!
909	0	a	This buffet has a past-its-prime feel about it, and that includes the look and taste of most of the food too.  The front reception/cash register area was dirty and the seating behind it was strewn with dirty and tattered personal items. The carpeting in the dining room was beyond filthy and gave the whole place a decidedly dingy feel. The restaurant seemed to have ample staffing but everyone seemed to be running around looking stressed out and overwhelmed, except the young woman sitting at the hostess station who occasionally dozed off and seemed oblivious to everything going on around her.  The steam table food was the stereotypical Chinese-American style stuff with chicken-everything.  When we arrived at about 12:45, the restaurant was maybe at 20% capacity, yet many of the lunch buffet selections had been depleted and not refilled. Much of the food appeared to be from frozen/prepared products.  I opted for the stuffed crab and the small prawns; those weren't too bad I have to admit.  Overall, no return trip.
910	1	a	Went there, wait time was only about 10-15 minutes, including the time I was filling out paperwork. The front staff was alright and the nurses and doctor were knowledgeable and made me feel like I was in good hands. I felt a lot better after visiting them with the help of antibiotics of course :)
911	0	a	My wife went to this facility after falling and hurting her ankle. There was no wait and the staff was friendly enough.\nMy first clue should have been when an aide had to be shown how to activate a cold pack.\nX-Rays were taken and the doctor on duty misread them as a sprained ankle. He said her pain would subside in two or three days. She was sent on her way with an ace bandage and a pair of crutches.\nTen days later, a podiatrist told her she had been hobbling along on a broken ankle the whole time.
912	1	a	Great office! Very convenient coming in with no appointment and had no wait time. Office staff was very accommodating and polite. Dentist was very informative, knowledgable and friendly. Will definitely continue with this office for all of mine and my families dental care.
913	1	a	Haven't. Been to the dentist for 18 years one greatest experiences i had i walk in with the wrost pains in my life. I sit dwon they offer to num me up while i was waiting. They offer great cost to pull my tooth iwas scared out of my mind. Not to worry he came backand nummed me again to make sure everything was good to go. He pulled my tooth so fast i never got to feel any pain. Greastest dentist ever i will becoming back for more work to be done
914	1	a	Had a great time. Sat at the bar, Ryan and Rachel are awesome! Ask for them by name. Love the new look! I'll be here every week!!!!!!
915	0	a	Worst service ever. Where was the utensils, the bottomless fries, the refills? Food was good but waited 15 minutes for server to get order and another 20 minutes for bottomless fries.... Which I am still waiting for. Server is too busy helping others. Well Red Robin you have lost a customer! Mel was our waitress and she seriously needs more training. She was nice, but really needs to get her sh*t together as a server.
916	1	a	Not for everyone. Lots of machines but free weight selection is very limited. Facilities are usually very clean. Just like any gym, sometimes there are crowds, sometimes not.\n\nI pay for the $20 monthly membership so I can use the massage and tanning. That package is a great value, plus it allows me to bring guests.\n\nStraight men, DO NOT go on Friday nights. I just found this out last night. The place was a gay bath house. I'm not homophobic, I just don't go to the gym to be stalked. It started in the locker room. This guy sat staring at me, at first I thought he was just waiting to get to his locker, then I realized all the lockers near me were empty. I even asked if I was in his way, he huffed and headed to the shower area. Then while on the floor, two guys were making out in the stretching area. While I was working out on a machine, locker room guy appear again. He sat at the machine across from me, not working out, just occasionally giving me a glance. The final straw for me was when he walked into the black card member area and sat there while I was on the hydro massage bed. I finally had to tell him that we don't like the same brand.
917	1	a	I had a good experience with this place. I am not a huge pho fan to begin with, but decided to try this place for lunch on a work day. I got carryout. The staff was very friendly and my food was ready quickly. The pho was very good and had a lot of meat and veggies in it. The to go set up is really nice and they separate everything for you to mix together yourself. I would recommend based on my experience.
918	0	a	The waiter got our our order wrong over and over again. Each time they brought out our food, we weren't sure what we were getting. The servers were nice, it just would have been ideal to get our order correct.... I felt guilty because our egg rolls came out at different times, one girl didn't get her pho until after all of us were eating, and we had to keep requesting things like our water, chopsticks, napkins... Etc. \nOne of us ordered extra meat because the pho has barely in it, and they brought it out practically raw, and with the soup being like warm, we know it won't cook the meat. \nWe're in from out of town, however, I hope locals know better than to spend their time and money here when there are so many other restaurants around.
919	0	a	I was on my way the The Hero Factory when I noticed this place had opened. It's their grand opening and it showed. Ordering was a bit chaotic, but customers are still getting a feel for the layout. The Hangover Burger sounded terrific, topped with bacon and an egg. Then I saw they have poutine and I about jumped for joy! Poutine, in downtown Phx? This, I had to try.\n\nIt took about 15 minutes for my order to come up. Maybe a little on the long side, but not terrible. However, orders were coming up out of sequence, and that didn't make any fans. \n\nSo, I brought lunch back to the office and announce the new place has poutine. Only one person knew what I was talking about. At this point, I think you understand how significant this food is to me. I spent nearly every weekend in the late '90s in Canada. Yea, I thought. A taste of my second home. Sadly, this was not what I was looking forward to. While the fries were good, they were topped with shredded cheese and beef broth. Beef broth!! Ugh. At this point, I'm just a grumpy otter so that might have made the burger just okay. Not good, just okay. The bun was nice and soft, but the meat tasted industrial. For $13.21, I was hoping for more. I'll give them a couple of weeks and head back. Hopefully things will have improved. Until then, I'll sulk over these soupy fries. Gah!
920	0	a	Open late and delivers according to all of there flyers.  Huh?  It's 7:30 on a Friday night and the Dbacks are in town.  Wonder how long this place will stay in business.
921	0	a	My group had a cheeseburger, hot dog, and chicken pita sandwich. We all agreed each of our items were terrible. I took two bites of my cheeseburger and had to throw the rest away. The food had no flavor, the french fries were extremely greasy and slippery.  The restaurant is over priced for the non sense they seem to think is appropriate to feed people.  Its safe to say we won't be going there again.
922	0	a	"My first mistake was going in at 12:15 on a Thursday afternoon, during the middle of lunch rush, to a place that has only been open a couple weeks. That one's on me. From there on out, on them.\n\nBurger lunch special wasn't so special. Bun was warm and soft but HUGE and you had to search to find the small \""1/3lb patty\"". Every bite was 3/4 bread and 1/4 everything else. I know it's the cheap lunch special, but at least make it somewhat tasty if you're going to advertise it in every building.\n\nFries were meh! Surprisingly long line just to refill your soda pop. Couldn't quite figure that one out.\n\nOnly good thing I can think of, great location and great vibe inside. Hope they figure things out and stick around so I can give it a second chance."
923	0	a	2nd time we've come and they're CLOSED when they're supposed to be open! WTH!? Came by at noon on a Saturday and at 7pm on Thursday! POOR advertising. Why set out street signage with hours when they're not open!? And they deliver!?? Yah right, no-one answers the number. What a shame since downtown could really use a good burger place, especially one that is open late.
924	0	a	"My first 2-star review. I should have been wary when they initially advertised as a bbq/burger joint then ended up ditching the bbq.\n\nI ordered an Italian beef, dipped, with hot peppers; and fries. Totally disappointing. The fries were indeed fresh but weren't all that great. The Italian beef was all wrong. The hot peppers were not giardinera but just marinated jalape\u00f1os. \""Dipped\"" here apparently means just spooning some jus onto the beef. Regardless, had it been actually dipped, the jus would have made it way too salty. \n\nSaw them making burgers on the grill. Not hand-formed, looked frozen. You'd think that a place called Burger Joint Chicago would do the burger part or Chicago part well. At least on this first visit, I was impressed by neither."
925	1	a	I'm only giving 4 stars because of their confusing hours. I never know when they are open because the hours are constantly changing. \nI didn't expect to like this place as much as I did but the burgers are great. I ordered a hot mess burger and it was really good. I wish they would have asked how I wanted it cooked, or better yet I wish I would have told them how I wanted it cooked but none the less it was great.
926	0	a	"Ok, I have tried three times to like this place. But they keep failing me. Maybe it's startup jitters?  \n\nMy main issues: \nToo pricey. Today was over $14 for a crazy Greek burger, gorgonzola fries and a soda. The bigger had cheddar cheese and a few bits of gyros. Fries were a $2 up Chafee to have them throw some cheese crumbles. \nThe burger. Ok, I like the 6 oz patty, but it is frozen and uninspired. Three bun is simple, there is no gourmet at all about any of this, except the name. Nor worth the price. \nThe small things.  Only 8 choices on the soda machine, today two off them were out by 11:30 am. Constant sticky floor. I ordered a bbq bacon burger today, was told they had no bacon \"" would you like to add an ingredient?\"" It's a bacon burger, I want bacon. If I am eating in, (they do have a spacious dining area with rock on the speakers) then don't wrap everything up to go. Last time my fries were cold. \n\nI will give them over more shot in a month or so to see if they ironed the bugs out."
927	0	a	I was less than impressed with Burger Joint. I work in downtown Phoenix; there's no reason to go here when Five Guys is nearby and WAY better. \n\nI think I finished the burger, but tossed the fries. \n\nSorry, I just can't lie to ya. I'm not going back, and I wouldn't take anyone here. \n\nNote: As of recently, this places closes at 3 p.m. That may change as the weather gets cooler.
928	0	a	"I have been twice, each time for a chili dog to go.  It's an easy order, but the first time it took almost ten minutes, despite few customers, and the second time about half as long.  Both times an employee asked what I was waiting for, and only then did they find my order.  I was not the only person that waited, on each occasion, for an inordinate amount of time for an order.\n\nThe first time a manager felt bad about how long I had been standing there and \""comped\"" me some fries, which I threw away because they were soggy and just gross.  The second time, despite ordering it to go, the chili dog came in a basket to eat \""in\"".    \n\nThe chili dog had onions on it (nobody asked if I wanted onions) and the cashier was effectively hidden behind a stack of styrofoam cups. The chili dog was slightly better than a 7/11 product, but at almost triple the price and with a long wait.  Another customer had a gyro, which looked appetizing, but I am not sure I will be back to try it.    \n\nI was hoping for someplace where I could grab something to bring back to the office but it doesn't appear that this is the place.  Huge space, with a small crowd (five or six employees or more, and approximately ten or fifteen guests).  Until they improve how fast the food gets out, the crowd will dwindle even more."
929	0	a	I ate the hot dogs... Really not good at all... Plus soggy French fries... Sweetened iced tea in the unsweetened dispenser...
930	1	a	This is the second time my husband and I have been here. The first, we sat in the dining room, and had a wonderful server. I think her name was Sonni...she had great service, we were even one of the last people to leave at the end of the night, and we still got great service! We sat at the bar this time, and service was still great. Got acknowledged within moments of us sitting down, and got drinks really quickly since it was close to happy hour ending \n\nFood has been consistently great, I had the chicken and steak fajitas the first time, my husband the fish tacos. The presentation was good, not great, but who cares about that as long as the food is good?! Things were cooked perfectly, and it all tasted very good. This time we had the chivche.....good, not great. We added a little more lime juice and that helped. The flavor was a little bland, but not bad overall. Although, it was really hard to get the chivche out of the margarita glass it was served in, so I suggest that change. Otherwise, everything was great tonight. \n\nWe will be back, and definitely bringing friends next time!
931	0	a	"It's really really sad... here we sit... tonight my family and I wanted Mexican... and figured we would try out the new joint in the hood... mistake... let's start with me... The black bean burger... GREAT flavor... however... it fell apart... when I took the bun off to place the burger back on , the bun... I realized it was stale!!!! Annnnnnd there was a quarter size squirt of chipotle mayo... sad...so sad... when I told the server...  \""sorry about that\""... she was sweet for sure... she just didn't have that \""let me take care of you attitude\""... listen... im a server myself... I would bend over backwards for a guest... my daughter had street tacos... ummmm don't waste your time... my husband had the green chili burrito.... veeeeeery disappointing... how can you get this stuff wrong?  This is all basic Mexican recipes... stale chips overly salted... my fries?  I'm almost sure they are frozen...  and the cherry on top... my husband is of the by gone era of \""finish everything in your plate\""... hes still eating, I refuse to eat crap and obviously my children are following suit... and the server asks (after my drink has been empty almost the whole meal) do we want refills... I say \""no, we are all finished\"" and she replies \""okay, shall I bring you the check?\"" ... young lady, my husband is still downing food... check? Jimney cricketts!!! She is definitely not trained properly... ummm honestly... I screw up as a server from time to time... I also try to make it right... this one... didn't get it... I'm sorry if she reads this... but more training is needed... oh on top of that... KNOW YOUR MENU!!! 56$  meal and we will NEVER go back!!!"
932	0	a	Save your self !!!\nHad the chili verde which had zero taste, green sauce tasted like it was from a can.\nMy wife and ordered margaritas that was liked a drink that sat for two hours. \nService is totally clueless!!! Doesn't even know there menu.\nIt's the same cheap owner who owned the restaurant prior and it shows!!!\nLeft and went to a real restaurant never will we step foot there again.\nThe manager has no idea on customer service, \nThe lettuce wraps had old lettuce, brown, piss poor.\nIt may be the only restaurant in the area but be real it is run like a high school cafeteria .\nZero stars\nNever going back!!!
933	0	a	Went there a few days ago hoping for good food. Well they missed the mark. Server said  Mexican pizza was great and it was not. We told her that, them tells us her mom said the same thing. Why did you recommend? Chimis were pretty good. Waitress was clueless, did not even try to up sell us at all. Not that we would have bought anything. \n\nOther Mexican places in area are better.
934	0	a	Nice spot, much better than the seedy former Cocomo Joe's.  In walking into the restaurant they wanted to seat us by the door..we asked for another table more out of the way..(the place was largely empty)..the gal vanished to find a table (how hard is this in an empty place)..almost 5 mins she came back and said she found a place and asked if we would like the table to be cleaned!! No, I'll just eat the garbage left from the folks before me..geez!! The server was very nice and accommodating however. Food was so-so..the two of us each had food that tasted somewhat 'odd' although couldn't put our finger on it--had almost a somewhat 'chemical' flavor to it. Anyway, we asked for the check and left a large bill ..the server then asked 'would you like change?'.. No I think I'll leave a tip that FAR exceeds the cost of two lunches!! Please ..this idiotic staff needs some training, the cook/owner needs to taste some of the food being served. If you can't get it 'right' in a local place you are DONE..this is a local trade place, please do some 'secret shopping' and see what you diners will be dealing with. To be fair this is also fairly new so I'll give it one more try in a couple of weeks, hopefully they will 'get it right' the next time.
935	1	a	This is the 4th time I've eaten at Asado. Tonight we got to go and tried something different. We got the spin dip for an app... AMAZING. I love this stuff!!!! \nFor the main course I got the carnitas burrito. I'm pretty picky about carnitas and this was melt in your mouth delicious. Rice and black beans were great as well. The cotija cheese on the black beans is a great touch.\nMy husband got the grilled chicken tacos, which he said were excellent. The grilled pepper and onions made it for him.\nThe best meal I've had at Asado was definitely the Chile lime roasted chicken. The chicken itself was tender & juicy. The chipotle mashed are always fantastic and the grilled vegetables add that extra touch of awesome. Oh, and you have to try the nutella empanadas... They are freaking incredible.\nEvery time I've been to Asado the service has really been exceptional. And you can't beat the tamarindo margarita!!!
936	0	a	For years we have been waiting for a  Mexican food restaurant and now, not to be nasty, still waiting.  The soft tacos were uninspiring.  Flour tortilla, might as well have used dinty moore meat.  Bland, a few shreds of lettuce and  a few dicings of tomatoes.  Cheese crisp, so-so but the worst part.  The margaritas were so bad we couldn't drink it.  We told the server about them, did she offer to take it off the check, NO!!  The service was okay but the food, not so.  Maybe we're expecting more.  My suggestion is to go to Carlos O'Briens, Maycayo's, or Luna for cues on how things should be done.  Don't think I'll be back until I have given enough time for the menu items to improve.  We want you to succeed but that just isn't the case at this time!!~
937	0	a	Jalapeno Inferno (the nearest Mexican restaurant) has nothing to worry about.  With one exception, the food was simply bland.  We started with the shrimp ceviche and guacamole.  Both were completely unremarkable, having very little flavor and no value with respect to presentation.  My finance had the salmon salad.  It was edible, but not good.  I had the steak fajitas.  Unlike the rest of the dishes we ordered, they were very good.  \n\nAlthough our server was very nice and responsive, he simply did not know the menu and appeared lost most of the time.   We observed similar behavior from the rest of the wait staff.   \n\nThe one are in which the restaurant excels is the d\u00e9cor.  It is very modern and well-done.  At the end of the day, we will not return to this restaurant and, unfortunately, cannot recommend it to others.
938	0	a	First time here since the remodel.  I ordered the Cubano sandwich.  I was hoping it would taste something like the Cuban sandwich from this food truck in tucson called DC Jumpie.  Well unfortunately I was disappointed.  The ham was over cooked and the pork lacked flavor, the pickles were good.  My mother order carnita tacos and she stated that the pork lacked flavor as well.  The black beans were too salty.  The sweet potato fries were quite good however.  They also have decent salsa.  \nAnother thing that the bus boys and waiters could do while they are waiting around would be to polish the silverware.  There are spots all over the silverware.  Something so easy could have changed my first impression.\n\nToo bad, I had high hopes for this place.\n\nI will probably try it one more time and give it a second chance.  I was told they have a fajita bar and it includes dessert.  Everyone deserves a second chance so it was not so terrible that I won't go back.
939	0	a	This restaurant is so bad that I felt compelled to create an account just to post this review! My wife had the house salad as an appetizer and much of the mixed greens was starting to rot. On top of that the balsamic dressing had the same consistency of butter.\n\nThe guacamole tastes like its out of a plastic bag....definitely not fresh. The chicken and steak tastes like rubber, straight out of the cheap Cisco truck and onto my plate\n\nThis has to be the worst Mexican food in all of the Phoenix area
940	0	a	Was disappointed when the owner closed Cocomo's and decided to go Mexican. I use to love getting the street tacos and Pittsburg wings during happy hour and maybe watching some sports at Cocomo's. Came to Asado specifically for the wings since they were always outstanding at Cocomo's, so I can't speak on the Mexican food part, although, the chips with the chips & salsa looked like somebody had stomped on them earlier as they were broken into tiny pieces. As for the wings, instead of 8 wings you now get 6 which are overpriced at more than a dollar a wing unless you do Happy Hour. No longer served in the kinda cool little bucket, they were wet and caked with spice, not crispy and lightly spiced like they use to be at Cocomo's. They weren't served with the good Wasabi sauce like they use to be so we had to ask for some. The waitress then brought out some sauce that was so watered down you could barely taste any Wasabi, looked like green water. Needless to say I was very disappointed that they would take one of their most popular items from Cocomo's and then proceed to ruin it. Not giving up on Asado yet, but the owner needs to address some of these issues mentioned in these reviews soon.
941	0	a	Nice environment but not much Mexican influence.  Food was bland.  Sent out my son's pollo fundido and the burrito was burnt on one side and the bland sauce just covered over it.  We had 6 people with us and nobody was impressed.  Too bad because we were hoping for a good new place.  Also a little pricey for the food served. Check the menu before you go because it is not traditional Mexican choices.
942	1	a	Asado is absolutely a five-star worthy restaurant relative to other Cave Creek restaurants, and is a great addition to this area of town. To sum it up - fantastic service, a very nice ambiance/interior, great portions, great food, and inexpensive prices. The only downside to the meal were the cocktails, which were all too sweet, but that's easily fixed by sticking to beer or soft drinks in the future. I loved the complimentary table salsa, which was perfectly balanced, fresh, with just a hit of heat.\n\nI don't remember the name of our waitress, but she was fantastic. After learning I was vegetarian, she took the time to check with the kitchen to find out what really was vegetarian and not. Turns out items that would be easy to think are vegetarian are not, and she was happy to help with suggesting other options that would work for me. For other vegetarians the green sauce, red sauce, and rice are not vegetarian. We had:\n\n- Bean & Cheese Chimichanga with Fundido Sauce: Yummo and so much food (two meals)! The fundido sauce was the vegetarian sub instead of red/green sauce, and it was really good. Pretty hard to not like cheese sauce. I added the fresh table salsa to brighten and lighten it up. I would happily order this again.\n- Guacamole: This was fine. I probably wouldn't order it again because the complimentary salsa was so good, but it was fine guacamole.\n- Green Chili Burrito: My husband had this and though it was really good. He loved the stew-like filling.\n- Strawberry Margarita: Typical frozen machine margarita with way too much sugar. Definitely not worth getting again.\n- Sangria: Also too sweet and not very refreshing. Besides an orange wedge and maraschino cherry, it was a wine cooler.\n- Elderflower Mule: Though the flavors were interesting and good (sort of tasted like a spa treatment), it was too too sweet.\n- Chopped Salad: Refreshing and satisfying as a lighter meal option. Great dressing, and lots of cheese and avocado as salad toppers.\n\nI definitely will be back to Asado, whether for eating in or picking up take out. I'm really glad such a good offering with reasonable prices has come to Cave Creek.
943	0	a	This was my worse experience ever   I like to eat out frequently and thought I would try this new restaurant.  They don't know what real Mexican food is.  I could buy the same cans at the store for less.  Even the margaritas were nasty. Service slow for as many as seem to be there.  I want Mexican food I will go somewhere else.  Sorry don't think I will ever come back.
944	0	a	The only thing this place has going for it is the decor. We had to ask for chips and salsa---a no brainer at a Mexican restaurant. I ordered the fajitas -- another no brainer. No guac, no sour cream, barely any rice or beans. The service was OK. I wouldn't recommend it. Go to Fajitas for fajitas, or Teepee for old-school Mexican fare.
945	0	a	Mediocre at best.  Service throughout the night was fine, nothing at all to complain about.  Tried a specialty margarita and it was junk.  Had chicken and steak fajitas and they were eh.  My kids ordered mini chicken quesadillas and they were full of chopped onions.  For kids.  I know my kids are picky eaters, but a kid's menu item should be simple.  Anyway, they did the right thing and made new ones for the girls.  All in all, prolly won't be back.  Sorry guys.
946	0	a	This place is so close to home that I really want to like it but there are just too many reasons not to.\n\nAs another Yelper stated the decor is nice post remodel and that is as good as it gets here.\n\nChips and salsa were brought to the table quickly and when my wife requested HOT salsa it was brought out quickly as well.\n\nPlaced our order..... carne asada burrito for me, fish tacos for my wife. They must be rationing fish in the kitchen.  Two tiny pieces in each taco which didn't fill the corn tortilla end to end. No flavor and not hot.\n\nThe carne asada burrito was small and the tortilla was like a firm paste. The quantity of tortilla outweighed the amount of carne asada. The beans were almost warm which puzzled me because the plate was very hot.\n\nMy wife asked for additional chips which never arrived to our table.\n\nWe were never asked if we enjoyed our meal. Im guessing that the amount we left on our plates spoke for us.\n\n5:30 on a Saturday night and the place is at 30 - 40% occupancy. I am pretty sure I know why.\n\nWe will not be returning.
947	0	a	Friday night first visit with friends.  Chips are good, both salsa and hot sauce were very average, have to ask for hot sauce.  Cheese crisp good, with good cheese, but waitress did not ask if we wanted any sides like guacamole or sour cream.  Ordered fish tacos which are horrible, dry with only a mango salsa which is terrible, and the fish is done in an extremely salty blackened rub, rendering the fish too salty to eat.  We left it untouched after two bites.  Most of the food here is salty and not handmade, chile rellanos was a dude too.  Black beans and rice are good, but the tortillas are bland store bought almost rubbery, and mine had beans only for nine dollars, a ridiculous price with no ala carte menu.  The service was terrible, waitress was overwhelmed, had no time to take the order and got several things wrong. Worse, she had nothing to say about the food or even thought to make a suggestion or tell us what was good.   No salt on margarita came with salt, asked for onions in burrito got none, when I told the waitress she just said they forgot and that happens, with no effort to correct the mistake.  On the bright side, the margarita was very good, most restaurants serve sickeningly sweet margaritas, where here the mix is perfect and you can taste some tequila.  Pricing was high for what you get, and the dishes came out too cold for Mexican food.  There was not one item to remember here, nothing to bring you back quickly, very average to very bad.  Best to sit at the bar for a margarita, the only really good thing on the menu. We have not heard good things from our neighbors, so hope this gets better.  The decor is nice, if not a bit dark, comfortable surroundings. We will not be going back anytime soon.
948	0	a	"Sadly, another disappointing addition to the Cave Creek dining scene. Man, we really (as in desperately, really really desperately) need something decent up here - but this ain't it. If any restaurant developers or entrepreneurs are reading this - a decent, independent restaurant with a good bar and wine list would be mobbed! I think Tatum Ranch alone has 10k residents with basically nowhere to eat.\n\nWe've been here 3 times, all mediocre at best. Our last visit kind of sealed the deal on us never returning.\n\nOutside patio area is nice, especially the booths! Great during nice evenings. Nonstop chips. They have really trained their servers and wait staff very well how to serve and cater to the customers. My only (weird) complaint really is that there isn't much \""personality\"" amongst the employees/servers - it's obviously a very well-honed serving system that they have trained their people on, but it lacks authenticity a bit. It's not really a complaint, but it just feels a bit off I guess.\n\nThe food is pretty gross. My husband ordered the pollo fundido and the chicken MUST HAVE been frozen chicken. I could be wrong, but it tasted and looked just like that weird frozen, fake defrosted chicken color and tasted just like weird frozen defrosted chicken with the fake grill lines. It was literally inedible and gag-worthy. For a Mexican restaurant where pollo is front and center in most dishes, this is inexcusable. \n\nI am SO SO SO sad that we don't have another new restaurant to frequent. I will stick with Amaro next door that is so underrated that it's shocking. I love that place."
949	0	a	I wanted to like this place.  They obviously spent a fortune on the remodel, but the food and the service don't match their architectural efforts.  I was going to sit at the bar and have a quick bite, and it was just sort of a mess.  Barstools were strewn all over, which I know shouldn't be a big deal, but it's one of those little details I'd never really paid attention to before.  It made  it look like they weren't ready for you.  The staff just seemed like a bunch of kids left to their own devices, dropping silverware and loudly yucking it up.  Pollo fundido was terrible.  Tasted very flour-y, sauce on top was like mushroom soup without the mushrooms.  Whole thing was more like a fried fajita wrap.   Just a disappointing experience.  And I really wanted it to be good.  I hope they straighten out some of their issues.
950	0	a	I've tried this place 3 times now and I'm sad to say it's never gotten any better.  The worst part is that there's not a lot of options to go eat in this neighborhood.  If you're in the mood for Mexican food I'd suggest you take a drive and find somewhere else.
951	0	a	Okay...let me start by saying I am shocked at how many people gave this place a good review. \n\nI will be generous and start by saying some of the positives. Food was fresh... I would even call it tasty. It had a good atmosphere with a lot of potential. \nHowever, everything was over priced, portions were on the lighter side, and the service was TERRIBLE. It took between 8-10 min just to order drinks. The waitress acted as if she'd never had a table in her life. The kids menu was on receipt paper.....and when ordered the kids cheese crisp...there was nothing crisp about it.  When we were getting near the end of our meal, the bus boy came and started collecting things as if we weren't there. He started to take things that we weren't done with and when we told him we weren't done, he looked annoyed and disgusted. \n\nThis place was beyond dissapointing.
952	0	a	"I want this place to be good, since it's in the neighborhood - but it's falling short of the mark. \n\nDuring our first time in, we had \""ok\"" food and good service - but an unexpected high bill (and minimum alcohol, so it was a surprise). But I didn't feel compelled either way to write a review ... I wasn't completely under- or overwhelmed.  \n\nTonight, it was a bad experience - and I'm not compelled to return to Asado Mexican Kitchen again. Here's the scoop:  we went in for drinks only, and it quickly became obvious that the bartender doesn't really enjoy her job (what a difference it makes when a bartender likes his/her job!). My fianc\u00e9e ordered a Cosmo, and what we got was far from any Cosmo we've ever had. It tasted like there was lots of grapefruit juice in it. Is the bartender trained for her job?\n\nNext, we figured we'd try the draft beer ... How can you go wrong with beer? The beer was good. However, on the 3rd beer, we were served a different beer than we ordered ... that's not really a big deal, but when the bartender treats you like it's your fault and she has no remorse whatsoever, one begins to wonder.\n\nTo finish the evening, my fianc\u00e9e used the restroom and came back totally disgusted - it smelled pretty badly - we're talking sewer smell. We never had that experience back when it was Cocomo Joe's. Sigh. \n\nBummer. We had high hopes for this place."
953	0	a	First time visiting this restaurant, and heard about it from the groupon deal. As a recent transplant to AZ, most mexican restaurant food is always amazing compared to the east coast. However, this restaurant fell short of our expectations of good Mexican food.\n\nMy husband ordered the highly recommended Pollo Fundido. The chicken was extremely chewy and the cheese looked like a processed slice of cheese was melted on top of it. I ordered the vege and chicken tacos which were good, but nothing out of the ordinary.\n\nThe margaritas were very sweet and barely had any alcohol, they were definitely overpriced. I've never left a restaurant without finishing a drink, and tonight I barely drank 1/4 of it. Waste of money if you ask me.\n\nI wouldn't recommend this place. The atmosphere is great and it has so much potential, but the food is terrible. Service was just okay.
954	0	a	We were really anticipating Cocomo Joes new remodel and now are sadly disappointed. We ate at Cocomo Joes often and food was good and the resteraunt had character. The remodel looks pretty but no character and the food has been disappointing and I believe we are done. There are too many Mexican resteraunts that are better than this. Personally I feel they made a big mistake.
955	0	a	"I am a registered nurse and a freelance writer who went to see Dr. Lin with my fiance in December of 2013. We waited at least 30 minutes in a crowded waiting room. Obviously, they pack in the patients like sardines,. That should have been our first clue about this organization. We filled out our medical forms and waited. When we saw Dr. Lin, we were rushed because she had a procedure pending, which of course was more money than a simple office visit. She talked to my fiance about his problems for a few minutes and did a needless biospsy, which later scarred him. When I wanted to ask her some questions, she left abruptly and we waited for fifteen minutes for her return. She never came back. Someone else handed us a useless prescription for a wrong diagnosis. I called the office the next day and asked if they charged my insurance and they said \""yes.\"" I was furious since Dr. Lin was abrupt and didn't examine me. I did get one question answered about a mole on one arm, but she didn't ever treat me as a patient, yet charged my insurance for her services. \n\nI tried to get in touch with the office manager which took ten days. She was rude and finally called me back, but didn't listen, only made snide remarks. I mentioned that I have been a nurse for over twenty years and that Dr. Lin definitely needed to improve her bedside manner and her educational skills. My fiance has two scars from the biopsy taken mouths ago. My insurance paid her money and billed me $30.00, which is a joke. \n\nI tried to reason with an unfriendly and rude office, but they didn't seem to care. She never once called to talk about the problem. Too busy I guess to care about her patients. No surprise. I was upfront with the office manager after our conversation and told her I am going to write about my experience. I don't recommend this dermatologist to anyone. The experience left a bad taste in my mouth."
956	0	a	"Having been a consumer of health care in New York, New Jersey, Washington, DC, Boston, Atlanta, and the State of Israel, I can honestly state that my experience at Affiliated Dermatology was the most unprofessional in my life. So far.\n\nI called to confirm my 11 AM appointment at 10 AM and was told I was all set. I arrived for my appointment 5 minutes early and waited a total of 65 minutes--at noon--before being escorted back to an examining room where I was told the doctor would be \""right in.\"" Fifteen minutes later I looked outside and was asked by a staffer if I was looking for someone. I asked if my doctor was coming as I was told she would be right in, and I had already waited more than an hour. She was polite and stated she would check for me. She returned momentarily and told me the doctor would be right in and apologized but they had been backed up with surgeries from early in the morning. I told her that she might considering sharing this information with the rest of the staff so that when considerate patients call to check on their appointments they can be informed of delays. I added that if they are overbooked, they should say so and reschedule. \n\nAnother five minutes later and a different staff member came in and suggested we go to the desk to reschedule. I laughed and said that if I am rescheduling, it will be with another practice. And that's what I did. I will let you all know if they are any better."
957	0	a	Went to take my 3 year old to get some stitches on his chin after a fall at day care. Maybe it was just this day but I have never been to a slower place 8 people in front of us.  1 hour 45 min waiting and the only called back 3 people.  3 familys also left in front of us.  When we told the nice young lady at the desk we were gonna have to go somewhrre else she sigh and acting like it was normal. Bathroom was dirty, no paper towels.  Only good thing was the front desk staff was nice and smiley..
958	0	a	We have wanted to try this place for awhile. Yuk I can't even say it was american Mexican sad to say we would have been better with Taco Bell. The service was poor and the enchilada sauce tasted like cheap canned sauce. We love a good taco shop this is not it. My fianc\u00e9 says they should be arrested for pretending to be a authentic Mexican place lol. The shredded beef chimichanga woah they fried the lettuce in the burrito. Never again
959	0	a	First time to this restaurant. Not terribly impressed. \n\nStart with cleanliness. There were flies in the restaurant. The bathroom had not been cleaned. The rest of it looked okay for a small taco shop. There is only fast food restaurant type seating.\n\nService was good. The woman behind the counter was very good at explaining the food and give me some recommendations. She was courteous and nice.\n\nThe food is okay. Price to quantity was pretty good. But I would rather have less quantity and more quality. It was relatively bland food. The salsas were okay but they all kind of taste the same. I spent $13 on chips and two large flower tacos with beans and rice. \n\nThis restaurant was just under okay.
960	1	a	This place just shot up to my favorite taco shop in all of Phoenix!  The carne asada is the best this state has to offer. Deliciosa!!  The salsas, though not as hot as I'd like, fantastic flavor. \n\nI'll be back!!
961	1	a	I was really surprised with this place. We stopped to give it a shot since we pass it everyday. The food was delicious. The se\u00f1or taco burro was HUGE and I don't mean chipotle huge I mean 2 chipotle burritos huge. The flavors were perfect. I can't believe I didn't eat here before now.
962	0	a	I met my Wife here yesterday for lunch at noon. Since I had no breakfast, I am sure I got sick here. I had one of their shrimp dishes and started feeling sick before I even left the restaurant. I was in our bathroom most of the night, and could not sleep all night. I have never felt so bad. I will never go here again.
963	1	a	Chris is as good as it gets! I've hired at least 10 handymen for various jobs over the last nine years in real estate and most have been terrible. Chris arrived on-time to meet me at the property, gave me his honest assessment of the repairs, and delivered an extremely reasonable bid to me within an hour of leaving. I hired him for the job and he was able to take care of it over the course of two days. What I admired most was his communication, keeping me informed as he went along. He knew I had a deadline and completely worked with me to get the job done in a very timely fashion. There were a few small problems that cropped up during his repairs and he immediately called me from the property to discuss them and ascertain the best course of action. I totally trusted his opinion and he didn't let me down. The repairs were completed as scheduled and the work was excellent. He repaired a faulty doorbell, reworked some shoddy wiring on a sprinkler timer, fixed a drain issue under the kitchen sink and installed a new cabinet facing on the end of the bottom cabinets. He truly cares about his work and takes a lot of pride in it as well and it shows. Thanks Chris for your valuable time and hard work! I'm looking forward to calling you soon for another job!
964	1	a	Brand new (only opened 1 week ago) Korean bakery/pastry store/cafe. Many Korean specialties (chestnut bread) as well as Western delights:fudge brownies(yummy& just right consistency),lunch breads,from pizza baguette to calmari-stuffed blackish bread stick! There are several tables at the side and back of the store,the baked goods are well displayed,hygenically sealed,or glass encased,easily accessible, (the cakes and pastries are behind the refrigerated glass counter),and competitively priced. The location is directly across from the Concordia University's Hall building ,so come this school year,this shop should be doing a very brisk business indeed.
965	1	a	This place needs more recognition! Today was my second time visiting this cute little pretty brand new Korean bakery on Bishop. My first visit I had the green tea bingsoo which is a Korean shaved ice. It was not too sweet, and was like a fancy, interesting, icy cold dessert with a mixture of green tea and what I thought were marshmallows but were (I think) rice dough/cake pieces. My Korean friend told me this particular bakery specializes in bing soo, so if it's your first time and you don't know what to order, go for the bingsoo! You will not be disappointed. They have mango, red bean, green tea etc. I'm not sure which one is the best, but I don't think you can go wrong with any of those options.\n\nMy second visit, I had a latte and pizza baguette, with a red bean bun that I was supposed to save for my bf but ended up eating a chunk of it with my latte. Both were quite good. They aren't jam packed with flavors the buns and the baguette, but it's still good. I think it might be a good thing because it isn't overly sweet or saucy. \n\nThe atmosphere of the place is very clean and modern. I really like it. I highly recommend visiting this bakery for a snack/dessert/coffee break if you are a Concordia student/live in the Guy area, or are downtown looking for a sweet spot to check out. Go go go!
966	1	a	Authentic LAN ZHOU beef noodles.\n\u771f.\u6b63\u5b97\uff01
967	1	a	Handmade noodles in a wonderful beef broth. Sliced beef shanks on top with scallions.\n\nOrdering is simple, first you choose what size bowl you want. I was famished and went with the large. Be warned, I highly recommend that you stick to the medium because the large size was gigantic. You can also choose what thickness you want your noodles to be.\n\nThere are a few appetizer options: spicy cucumber, pickled cabbage, marinated eggs.\n\nI went with the spicy cucumber since it was hot outside and wanted to whet my appetite even more.\n\nIt reminded me of my travels in Asia where I would walk into a small noodle shack and sit down at the bar and watch the chef make the food in front of me.\n\nSimple, honest and great noodles. What more does a hungry man need?
968	0	a	I just order one soup for take out....it's over price,and the beef was not fresh...and the soup taste nothing....I think I like Vietnamese pho more than Lanzhou noodle..sorry...

973	1	a	Just took Ewok, my approx. 6 month old shih tzu pup, to Lilac today for his first grooming and it was a great experience! \n\nI emailed her multiple times with questions a few weeks leading up to our appointment as we adopted him about a month ago and just recently finished his final set of shots so he could finally get groomed!\n\nAs new puppy parents with a scruffy puppy that wasn't properly cared for or groomed before we rescued him, I had a lot of questions and Lilac responded to all my emails within a reasonable time frame.\n\nConsidering that my husband and I both have really demanding and time consuming jobs, we were especially appreciative of her flexible schedule. We were originally scheduled for 3/4 PM on Friday but on Wednesday evening, we called and moved the appointment up to 5 PM Friday with no problems.\n\nLilac did a great job as Ewok looked good and smelled great! Never knew a dog could smell so good!!\n\nWe took advantage of the $10 off yelp check in deal but considering the great job she did and that we were her last customers on a Friday night, we tipped her $8 bringing our total to $43 ($45 - $10 + $8) as we felt bad for keeping her late on a Friday.

976	0	a	"I had eaten here 2 weeks ago and I ordered a foot long hot dog and fries for 3.99 and I thought \""what a great deal\"". I went back today and the same meal was 6.90! I was taken by the huge jump in price. The clerk had a bit of an attitude when I asked about the increase.  I was also told a drink comes with the meal, (which I did not want) I told the clerk I did not receive a drink on my last visit. She did not apologize for the mistake or offer to give me the drink I did not get last time. She also told me fries are a premium side dish and cost .47 extra. Really? fries? The menu has an excessive amount of \""hidden\"" extra costs. I asked for my money back and will not be returning. I know prices increase, but almost double the price and the attitude was not necessary."
977	0	a	One of the worst shops I've ever been in.  The owner, Robert, is horrible and doesn't know what he's doing at all. This shop doesn't even deserve one star but it's the lowest it'll let me go. I took my 13 year old daughter in there and Robert did nothing but try to flirt with her and stare at her like a piece of meat! This place is so unprofessional and the piercing Robert did came out completely crooked and wasn't even deep enough in the tissue to stay in. If you care about quality you should stay away from this shop. No joke.
978	1	a	I'm thrilled to have the opportunity to write a review for Third Eye Body Art! My experience was phenomenal and I can't wait to return. I've had many piercings done at several shops throughout Arizona, this was by far one of the best experiences. Rob (Shop Owner/Piercer) was very inviting from the moment I walked in the door. He is very knowledgable and informative, he definitely knows what he's doing. \n\nThe shop: It's fairly new, but I already like the direction they are going with their decor. They have custom art from local artists that you have to check out! Very clean, you can tell they pride themselves in keeping the shop sterile. They also have mints for their guests. Winning!\n\n\nThe jewelry: Absolutely beautiful! You can tell it's high quality, which I love! Yes, the jewelry is more expensive than most shops, but you get what you pay for. I've learned this the hard way at other shops and don't care to make that mistake again. I'm happy to know that this shop uses only the best.\n\nThe piercing process: The moment I sat down I was at ease. Rob was kind enough to talk me through his piercing process as well as make me laugh. I felt safe knowing I was getting pierced by a professional. All together everything went very smooth. I didn't cry, so that's a plus. :)\n\nIf I could give this review 10 stars I would. Unfortunately, Yelp has star limitations. Thank you Rob for making my birthday wonderful and special! I will be returning soon for a new fancy clicker for my septum.
979	0	a	Way too expensive.  My wife and I spent $20.00 for two small yogurts.  Product was acceptable but the cleanliness was questionable.  Flies everywhere.  Management is aware of the problems but feels that it is the customer's issues rather than the business 's problems.  If amount of business is an indication, we were the only customers the entire time we were there and we will not be back.
980	0	a	SUMMARY: Overpriced, stingy on samples, bad customer service, and no water!  \n\nUsing Yogurtland in Chandler as the baseline of what a good yogurt place SHOULD be, let's review:\n\n1.  Yogurtland is not afraid to set sample cups out and let you have at it.  Swirls refuses to let you sample it unless the checkout girl personally fills up your sample cup and hands it to you.  \n\n2.  Yogurtland has a nice fresh lemon/fruit-infused filtered water with cups sitting out.  Swirls doesn't have ANYTHING to drink, unless you want to buy a bottle of water.  \n\n3.  Yogurtland's price is about 2/3 that of Swirls....and Yogurtland has better and more flavors and much better looking toppings.  \n\nUltimately this just becomes another example of how you go to a place because you're in Scottsdale mall, and what could possibly be less than amazing, cool and wonderful inside that place?  Answer:  Anything people are dumb enough to patronize for that reason alone.
981	1	a	Great food, nice people, open on Sundays, super cool. Will come again when in area. My daughter loves the pot stickers.
982	1	a	Good food, nice and hot wonton soup for a cold night. Orange chicken for me, sesame chicken for him, specials w/spring rolls, and lots of rice too much for me. Just right amnt of spice in orange chicken. Most of the business was take out, we stayed, clean dining area, tv with silly game show. Only problem was when the door opened and the cold came in. Staff stopped by the table to make sure all was good.\nI would return when in the mood for asian cuisine, and in the neighborhood.
983	1	a	Attended a Wine and Design painting session today at Piggly's BBQ and Grill. I am not an artist or painter and was nervous. Ended up having a blast and really like the way my painting turned out. Going again this Tuesday, looking forward to another great time!  If you're looking for a fun time, I would definitely suggest checking out Wine and Design!
984	1	a	*** EDIT: Not sure why, but I made the update to the location and they moved my review to the old location and deleted it here. They even took my new picture and attached it to the old location. ***\n\nI believe this is a new location first of all. It is in the same general location as the old one though?\n\nIn any case the front desk girls were helpful and quick to get us signed up despite being a walk-in. I am not sure how much faster it would be with an appointment but im guessing that they fit you in as they can around the appointments.  All the appointments online were full.
985	0	a	The staff here was rude and in no hurry at all.  I waited 90 minutes for a simple blood test and finally gave up and left without getting it done by them.  In addition they are not sending blood work results to dr offices in a timely manner anymore.  My dr has had to chase down results many times now.  Looks like its time to find a new lab.
986	0	a	Expect a long wait. The front desk personnel are rude and ask stupid questions. I had an order the nurse wrote stat on and the woman asked if I wrote that. Really?! do people do this because they are so pokey? Also when I arrived I needed to use the facilities. I was asked if I had orders before they would let me use the toilet. So people come in all the time to use their toilet. As if you can even find where they are. Rude!
987	0	a	"Gelato Bar is a clean spot but their gelato just doesnt hit the mark of being deserved to be called Gelato.. The interior is really clean and comfortable but they do still have a few small kinks to work on. Firstly their gelato a little too cold, as it touches the tongue it almost stings and numbs, after about 2 bites (literally) I had to stop because it was just too cold to eat. Instead of a creamy and smooth consistency, its more hard and icy and breaks off when you scoop it, again most likely because their coolers are too cold. It was so hard in fact when the girl tried to put the wafer crisp in it, she accidentally broke it and had to replace it with a new piece, and while she was scooping it. It had the texture of cheap ice cream left in the deep corner of a freezer for months. Gelato should be soft and smooth. Another thing that Irked me was that upon entering, the girl working there didn't event know the name of their own establishment and said \""welcome to... laughed and had to look at the sign... gelato bar.\"" She also had no clue about any of their flavors, and wasn't very helpful.\n\n The upside though, their prices are pretty cheap and reasonable and they have a buy 2 get 1 scoop free going on now which is not bad.\n\nI was hoping for a new spot to get gelato that was away from the strip and a little closer, but I guess if I want gelato I'm still going to be heading to either forums shop or Art of Flavors..\n\nEnding Summary: Clean spot, staff are nice but not very knowledgeable about their own establishment name or products, gelato too hard and icy. 1 star worthy."
988	1	a	They have pistachio flavored gelato!! And wow was it awesome! I had that and two scoops of coffee gelato, which was recommended by one one of the girls who works there. \nThey're all so nice their. I like how the owner makes the gelato fresh everyday! I was also told that new flavors were yet to be introduced. \n\nGreat place with exceptional service!
989	1	a	Delicous strawberry gelato! It's so refreshing you could really taste the strawberries!!!
990	1	a	Great flavors. The chef/creator was real cool and she basically let us try all the flavors and everything tasted just like what it said. Gotta be 21+ to try the whiskey gelato n the rum raisin and youll see/taste why after trying it. I went with a scoop of the pistachio n a piece of the napolean custard cake dessert. I love pistachio gelato especially the one by Talenti and the  pistachio here, with whole pistachios in it mind you, definitely tops em all. She makes all her gelatos with fresh ingredients and you can definitely taste that. I'm definitely coming back for her watermelon gelato. She said she uses a whole watermelon to make it.
991	1	a	Walked in, place is spotless \nWe were greeted by a very nice lady behind the counter. She explained to us that all the flavors are made in house and voluntarily gave us a sample of each flavor as she explained which ones were her favorite!\nThey have board games for people to play as then eat their ice cream!!\nI love how it's so inviting and the staff is friendly. Very good prices too and the flavors are unique and all amazing!!! Will be back!
992	1	a	Found this place on yelp while I was in Vegas.  This place opened up about 2 months ago.  The gelatos are made with all natural ingredients.  Very tasty. Ordered a 3 scooper which consisted of cookies and cream, pistachio, and coffee.  All were great.  Free wifi and board games.  They also have free toppings if you wish to add on additional sweetness to your gelato.  \n\nPlace has tv, music, clean tables and a large parking lot.  Also takes credit cards.\n\nAll in all a great place to satisfy your sweet tooth!  Check this place out and support your local small businesses!!!
993	1	a	Gelato Bar is a cozy nice gelato spot in Chinatown.\n\nFurniture is much nicer than a typical gelato joint, service is friendly, and portion is generous.\n\nOK, maybe the portion is too generous, and it was too much for us to consume three scoops. We would be more thrilled if they could offer smaller portions at a lower cost.\n\nWe'd appreciate more if we could taste 4 flavors of small scoops rather than 2 flavors of large scoops. Just thinking out loud.
994	1	a	OK who doesn't love some boom ass gelato! I came in tonight craving something sweet and was not let down. I was greeted instantly and given multiple free samples. I usually have go to flavors but was given some I would have never picked to sample. I instantly fell in love with the tiramisu. One scoop came in a cute pink reusable bowl with a waffle cookie for about $4.\n\nThe lady working there was super nice. She told me all about the gelato's and that they are all made in house. \n\nIf your looking for a cute hang out spot come here! Free wifi and lots of seating.
995	1	a	This place was fabulous! The lady was really sweet and asked if we wanted to try several flavored. They even had a peach tea which I have never seen before. My kids got Oreo and strawberry and I got tiramisu. This place has a lot of seating and free wifi. The owner even gave us a plate of Oreos and my kids loved it and ended up playing foosball for awhile. The price is pretty reasonable. Will definitely come back here again!
996	1	a	This place is super awesome! The lady was very sweet and helpful with any questions I had. Lots of fun flavors and all the ones i tryed had a punch of flavor, I tryed pastachio,orange , oreo, and lemon all super good! I would come back here for sure next time in im china town!!
997	1	a	So my company catered in NYPD today. They delivered pizzas, wings and salad. \n\nThe wings were good. Still hot, good amount of sauce and crispy skin. The pizza was good but had too much grease. They are large slices so the grease just pools up, making it unappetizing. Overall, the flavor was very good, with just the right seasonings, tasty sauce (could've used a bit more sauce tho) and good cheese. Again, very greasy tho. I'll try it again and see if ordering directly works out better.
998	1	a	Wonderful place for a slice and a brewski. Management was more than accommodating when there was a slight issue. Def recommend.
999	1	a	I actually really like this location. It's got a great bar and friendly employees. Pizza is better than average. I hope this place lasts because it's the best pizza joint on Mill
1000	0	a	"We've ordered delivery from here tons of times, and if it were up to me, I would've boycotted this place a long time ago (even though they've just opened).  And it's not that I hate pizza, I friggin' love pizza.  I'm happy with just about any pizza, except for the ones I've had from here.  To put things simply, I've had cheaper and much better overnight, cold pizza from Costco that tasted better.  At NYPD, the toppings on their pizzas are sparse, to say the least, the sauce is barely there, and don't get me started on the cheese.  It's disgustingly translucent when \""fresh\"", and even more so when eaten a day later.  Plus, there's barely any of it so all I see is dough, and more dough.  And grease.  Not worth the money they ask, or any amount of money really.  This is college town guys, get on your game or you're gonna lose out to the five million other pizza joints in town.\n\nOh, and I've had better cookies from Keebler."
1001	1	a	My wife and I have been here twice now and each time the subs were delicious and the prices are very reasonable. Plus, cheese curds! My favorite sub so far was the Philly cheesesteak. Great customer service too!
1002	0	a	I have been here 4 time and have walked out 3 cause they beer have enough ppl working no matter what time of day I come. Today was there at 11 am and they had one girl working the counter waited over 15 min to get my order taken. The food is good but firehouse is just as good and they have never made me wait. I predict I they do not get more ppl working the won't make it
1003	1	a	I love this place! I have always been a fan of all sandwiches and would always take my business to Subway, but once I found COusin's I never went back. This location is still somewhat new and so everything still looks fantastic. The crew usually does a good job in trying to get people out pretty fast but it does take a couple more minutes than other places, just because of the grill (does SW or Jimmy's have a grill, no!) The 3 girls that always seem to be there always greet us as soon as we step inside, are all smiles, and already know by memory exactly how I do my pepperoni melt, the best sub they offer! This is diffidently one of the locations I recomend!
1004	1	a	Must go Good food nice place. Food was fast to us, great for the family. Wil go back again.
1005	0	a	Checking out the previous reviews, I feel I may have significantly missed out by ordering online and having the food delivered to my home.  Given, though, that this was my experience, I'll share it, nonetheless, and just urge you to try it in person if you're going to bother.\n\nMy partner (an immigrant from Mexico) and I tried the quesadilla, nachos, tortilla soup, and french fries (which were a substitute for elote / corn because the restaurant had run out of corn).\n\nThe quesadilla was unexciting.  It was a flour tortilla with cheese stuffed inside and melted.  The tortilla soup, my fiance says, tasted like chicken noodle soup with crushed tortillas in it.  The fries were soggy at best, and the nachos were an atrocity.  It appeared as though they opened a bag of tortilla chips, threw on scoops of beans, avocado, and canned nacho cheese sauce, and left it alone.\n\nBy the time the food arrived, what was once hot was cold, what was once firm was soggy.\n\nIt may be because I adore Mexican food... it may be because I had it delivered instead of going into the restaurant... or it may actually be something wrong with the restaurant.  I can't say for sure based upon one experience... I can just say my one experience hasn't left me excited to try it a second time around.
1006	1	a	"D'abord, la place. Superbe ! Ok c'est faussement \""chic mais super grave \u00e0 la cool\"". On s'en fout l\u00e0, c'est super joli !\nEnsuite, le service. Top.

1007	1	a	Je suis d\u00e9finitivement en Amour ! Enfin une place ou le service est impeccable (pro et cool \u00e0 la fois, souriant, rapide bref quasi parfait). La bouffe est vraiment pas ch\u00e8re : j'ai pris le hamburger maison pour 6 $, tr\u00e8s honn\u00eate au niveau de la quantit\u00e9, bon, bien pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 (pas de la grande gastronomie mais on s'entend qu'\u00e0 ce tarif, c'est plus que bien). Les boissons sont aussi tr\u00e8s abordables en terme de prix, vari\u00e9es et bien servies (mention sp\u00e9ciale pour la sangria blanche qui est d\u00e9licieuse). Cela faisait longtemps que je n'avais pas trouv\u00e9 un endroit ou l'on peut boire un verre en grignotant des plats sympas dans un ambiance tr\u00e8s agr\u00e9able sans d\u00e9penser un demi-mois de salaire bref \u00e0 tester retester sans aucune mod\u00e9ration, par contre, l'endroit ne d\u00e9semplit pas donc il vaut mieux arriver t\u00f4t
1008	0	a	Very over salted, probably microwaved too. Salmon tartar tasted like garbage..... Definitely would not return. No wonder it was completely empty. Staff was friendly and service was fast though, so that's worth one star.
1009	1	a	What a great place to meet friends for drinks! If you're not familiar with mead, try the flight to figure out what you like best.
1010	0	a	Food quantities were nice service was nice but the food lacked flavor.... Salsa was bland, Rice was dry, beans no taste, my chimichanga had more onions and peppers than chicken... he thing I enjoyed most was the tea...I prefer Charanda near Baxter personally.
1011	0	a	Me and a co worker ordered a couple of burgers from this place. One well done and one medium well. Both of our burgers were raw.  Took one bite out of the burger and spit it out. When I went to show the manager he said it was medium rare. Don't make up excuses fix the problem. That burger messed up my entire day.
1012	0	a	As my co worker above , I received a rare burger as well. However I didn't have time to bring it to the attention of the management. I microwaved the burger so it was edible. The bacon was over cooked and the only real highlight was the free drink the manager gave me for waiting for my burger.
1013	1	a	Man, this place is great! Incredible atmosphere, friendly services, prices were great, and the food was great!  I had the jerk chicken wings and the flavor was fantastic.  Although the portions were nice, I found myself wanting more!  I ate outside in a cafe style atmosphere which was perfect!  The place was clean and the staff was very lively.  I can't wait to get back to try something else on the menu! Have my eye on the shrimp!
1014	1	a	This is a new place located in the North Part of the valley.  The menu is simple and easy to read and by the looks of it they serve breakfast, lunch and dinner.  The majority of the items were sandwiches and burgers but they also have little breakfast quiche that looked delicious.  I was able to try a sample of the brisket which I am always a fan of but this was slightly different than what I am used to. I enjoy a Texas style brisket with lots of smoke and a flavorful rub.  This had none of that but was still tender and tasty.  I decided to have the burger and o-rings which was alright.  \n\nWhat were more exciting to look at were the desserts and the gelato.  The Red Velvet pastry looked amazing among all of the other delicious choices.  It looks as if the pastries are very well done.  I was able to sample some of the 12 flavors of gellato that they make in house and out of the three I tried the bananas foster was my favorite, excellent flavors.  \n\nI cannot wait to go back here for some gelato and some espresso  while sitting on their outdoor patio area.  Welcome to the neighborhood.
1015	1	a	I live close by so I've been watching closely to see when this place opened to give it a try. I walked in and I have to admit I was impressed as I was not expecting things like gellato/ice cream, and cupcakes to tempt me on my way in... . I just got off work so I planned to grab a menu on my way home, but I actually decided to have an early dinner.\n\nI ordered to go and got one of their burgers. I was a little skeptical of the price till I realized they were half pound burgers. When I got home I saw the container not only with the massive burger, but it was filled to the brim with fries. Given that other places skimp on sides it was a very pleasant surprise. They were decent fries, nothing to write home about, but a good enough fry to go with a burger. I also got a side of onion rings as well since the price was right, and they were huge! Definitely tasted good, but I almost couldn't fit the food in my mouth! (I have a small mouth...thanks genetics), however even with it not quite fitting well in my mouth, I definitely look forward to trying Honey Cakes again, I had a feeling that their burgers weren't their specialty (or they're still trying to find their groove), and I hope that maybe a quarter/third pound might hit their menu in the future, as honestly a half pound with all the food they offer is too much food even for a fatty like me.\n\nThis place doesn't have everything, but has a lot of forays into various areas and plan to bring some of family to try them. My girlfriend loves crepes, My mom likes red velvet pancakes, and my dad could probably be swayed to the jerk chicken. I tried to avoid the desserts as I really didn't want to break my diet so I can't really speak on those.\n\nAs far as rating's, they still have a little bit of growing pains. They're brand new (at the time of writing) and it is obvious (As it is with any restaurant) that they are, but it is not their fault in the slightest. The food has generous portions, friendly staff, and I feel that once some of the wrinkles are ironed out it will be a solid addition to my food rotation. That being said, there's no wait on the food being good (I am very happy full after just having eaten there) and a solid 3.5-4 stars :)\n\nP.S. My burger was NOT raw even when I ordered it Medium.
1016	1	a	Four stars because it took close to 20 minutes to receive our food and we were the only ones there.  My lime chicken sandwich was very good. I had ordered onion rings for my side, but instead I was served French fries.  The waitress was apologetic and replaced them.  My little one had the truffle Mac and cheese, which was super cheesy and yummy.  \n\nFor dessert, I had a white chocolate eclair and my little one had the red velvet cupcake.  Both were delicious.\n\nI'm excited to have this establishment in my neighborhood and I wish the owners tons of success.
1017	1	a	AWESOME SERVICE!!!! I took my family to this cafe after finding it on restaurants.com. The food was great and the presentation of their desserts was comparable to a high-end restaurant on The Strip! We ended up chatting with the owner, who was very friendly. He, his wife, the cook and the girl behind the counter were all very attentive and it was obvious they each take pride in their business.
1018	1	a	Friendly, fast service, clean storefront and kitchen (I like that you can see into the kitchen!!), and a welcoming environment.  They had a great breakfast selection, but a chocolate cupcake caught my eye!! So rich and amazing and... their chef was amazed that I asked what kind of buttercream he used! It's not the shortening crap you get from some places!! Oh no!!! They make true Italian buttercream, and oh the difference!!! The flavor and mouth feel were perfect, the cake was still moist even though I feel the cupcake was made the day before.  The flavor was on point and not overwhelming or too sweet, and it was decorated beautifully! I will definitely return to sample more of their goods!!! I recommend this place to everyone! The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because I reserve that for near perfection.  I am not taking anything at all away from this gem of a cafe- it just isn't a Michelin starred place :)  Go visit them!!!
1019	1	a	Outstanding service, the food was amazing, great presentation and the cook paid a visit to make sure we were happy with our meal. Wish I lived closer, this would be a regular spot.
1020	1	a	What a Find!  Honey Cakes is a cozy place in a strip mall that serves excellent food and wonderful deserts.  We had dinner there tonight with a couple of friends and we were pleasantly surprised with every dish that we ordered.  I started with the French Onion Soup and it was fantastic.  The serving was in a saucer type bowl which was a conversation piece in itself.  My next dish was the Chicken Curry and again it was outstanding as well.  There was plenty of Chicken and the curry was very tasteful, but not overpowering.  It was served with white rice, which was great for soaking up the curry gravy and french string beans which were cooked to perfection.  I ended the evening with a small cup of Rum Raisin Gelato which was the best that I have ever tasted.  \n\nI would highly recommend Honey Cakes and we certainly will be dining there more frequently.
1021	1	a	I'm so pleasantly surprised by this little gem! My husband ordered the curry chicken, my daughter ordered the seafood sandwich with salmon and shrimp, and I ordered the tomato truffle salad!! It was all amazing!!! The service was out of this world!! The chef came to check on is and ask us how everything was. My daughter tried to get the seasoning recipe for the fries and he had a great sense of humor about their secret recipe. We ended with gelato, rum raisin, pumpkin, and mango!!! We. Will. Be Back!
1022	1	a	I had the French Toast which was great.  Coffee was delicious.   The service was very friendly.   A nice new place to enjoy breakfast with great shopping nearby.  I'll be back.
1023	1	a	I work a seasonal job at Best Buy and wanted to check this place out. I am so glad I did. The staff were very friendly and attentive. I like the ambiance of the place - it's very warm and cozy. They also play French music to add to the feeling of being in a real French caf\u00e9/bakery. I had a pistachio muffin and it was delicious! Next weekend I will definitely be back to try an entr\u00e9e during my lunch time. I am definitely recommending this place to my friends. I only wish there was another location near my home since I live in Green Valley/Henderson. Thanks again for your awesome service! :-)
1024	1	a	Great cafe! Very relaxing with outstanding service. The food is also very delicious! We will be back!
1025	1	a	Today was my first time in the Cafe and I must say it was an amazing experience. I met the owner and all the staff along with some of the staffs family that had walked in. Everyone in the Cafe was extremely friendly and the food was excellent. I can't wait to go back and try breakfast now and have another cup of coffee. I am a huge Starbucks fan but now after having the Columbian coffee there today..... Well.... Sorry Starbucks but this coffee is to die for along with the Spicy Rootbeer Tea
1026	0	a	First time here. I had read reviews on yelp, so figured i would give this place a try. Got a chocolate macaroon and it was Almost as hard as a rock. Needless to say i won't be back.
1027	0	a	The red velvet pancakes were spongy and had a sour  taste. The breakfast calzpne was mostly dough that was still raw. TERRIBLE!
1028	1	a	I liked the look of the place. It had a warm and cozy feel of an Italian cafe. I ordered chocolate chip cookies, oatmeal raisin cookies, and chocolate moose cake. They were all delicious. I went back for dinner the next day and ordered 1/2 jerk chicken that came with green beans, red beans & rice. I also ordered the honey 1/2 pound burger with fries. Both meals were full of flavor. I'm a satisfied customer. Also the lady at cash register was very friendly. I don't remember her name.
1029	1	a	"Swoon. I love the set up of this intimate cafe. It doesn't look like much from outside, but once you step inside it feels like you've been whisked away from Las Vegas. The caf\u00e9 is colorful and aesthetically well put together.  There's an inviting gelato bar, croissants lined up on top, and an attractive chocolate and pastry lay out.  Like I said, swoon.\n\nI ordered the veggie wrap ($6) and the mac 'n cheese ($6.95). After requesting the onions and avocado be withheld, I was presented with a wrap containing only lettuce, tomato, and cheese. Needless to say, this wasn't much of a wrap. There was a bunch of ingredients below the veggie wrap menu description I assumed were going to be thrown in. Now I know for next time I specifically need to ask for these extra ingredients. The mac 'n cheese wasn't my cup of tea (it's baked with onions that leave a distinct taste), but I have to admit it was still tasty.\n\nMy husband ordered the brisket BBQ plate ($12.95) and a side of onion rings  ($2.50). The plate came with green beans and white rice. I sampled the rice and the green beans, which were awesome. The rice was nice and sticky and the green beans tasted super fresh. My husband pretty much licked the plate clean. He even ate the fat off the brisket! Which he never EVER does. On top of that, he was praising the rice. That man doesn't even like rice. My husband asked our waitress to pass on compliments to the chef, who responded with a wide grin and said \""That's how we do, man!\"". \n\nTo finish off, we had some gelato. I tried the chocolate and my partner, the pistachio. We got the smallest size ($3), but it was plenty filling. \n\nWe'll definitely be back. I'm looking forward to trying out their breakfast menu next time.\n\nTIP: You order and pay at the counter, and there's a section for a tip. It kind of threw us off at first because we didn't know if we would have a waitress or if it would be more self-service. The waitress, if that's the proper title, brought the food to our table and checked if we needed refills. However, she never cleared any of our plates.\n\nYELP 100 CHALLENGE 2015: #02"
1030	1	a	My first time at this bistro and will definitely be back! It's perfect for to-go orders and the food is terrific! Serving soup, salads, sides, and sandwiches, I went for the Tasty Turkey Sammich- provolone, turkey, crispy bacon, spinach, and onion..and I asked mine to be wrapped in lettuce (I'm watching carbs). The ingredients were fresh and flavorful and the tomato and cucumber salad I ordered was equally as tasty. BONUS: The value is solid! Next time, which will be within the week, I'm getting the Spicy Italian Sammich-pepperoni, soppresata, salami, and provolone...and yep, in lieu of the garlic hogi, I'll be asking for a lettuce wrap!
1031	1	a	"OMG, these are great \""sammiches\""!  Even though the hubby and I eat here when we're visiting our salon in the Monogram Suites, we make it a point to stop by whenever we're in the neighborhood.  Between the two of us, we've tried at least a half-dozen different ones and truly can't make up our minds on which is the best; they're all fantastic.  Great service as well and, if they're offering their homemade 'sweets', do not pass them up!  You will never be disappointed in the food, the service or the prices!"
1032	1	a	Wonderful food and fun casual atmosphere. The food is delicious!  I hit this place up at least once a month. Never disappoints!
1033	1	a	Great coffee. Really good kolaches. Had a nice vibe inside. Nice, plush couches with outlets! I didn't stay but it seems like a good place to bring your laptop and drink coffee. Friendly cashier. Would return (if I lived here).
1034	1	a	"Everything is freshly baked the night before! Their coffee and tea is also delicious! Every time I've been here, the customer service is also outstanding. I'm greeted right when I walk through the door with friendly \""hello\""'s everytime! \nI will defiantly keep coming back. They have earned my business!!"

There packaging Sucks and they will try to blame the trucking company it will take 90 days of you fallowing up with them and at the end you get burned. Good prices sucky parts and service!

1039	0	a	Purchased a motor mount for my 2002 Volvo S80. Between 6 months and a year later the rubber bushing completely dissolved making this car unsafe to use. The company only offers a 6 month warranty which I can understand for normal wear and tear but this is a defective product that creates a safety issue and should be acknowledged and corrected.\n\nI can't imagine how many cars on the road right now driving with defective parts bought from them.
1040	1	a	All the meat, soup, and noodle dishes I had were pretty good. Definitely not the best I have had (considering I have been to Korean about 20 times), but by far the best in Arizona hands down (I have been to Cho Dang, Takamatsu, Hodori, Gogi, and Korean BBQ). This place just opened up a little over a week ago, so I am writing this review based on my three experiences there. The staff is friendly, the service is good, and the decor is... Well, let's just say that the food definitely makes up for the decor; keep in mind that it is a restaurant, not an art gallery.
1041	1	a	Excellent Korean food by Arizona standards. Side dishes are great and the staff is polite. The menu could use some work as people completely new to Korean food may not know what Yukgaejang is, but for those who are already familiar this is the best Korean food I've had in the valley (and I've been to all the major ones, Chodang, Hodori, Gogi etc). Highly recommended, don't miss this place! Got the Spicy Chicken Filets dinner plate, very tender and delicious with the side dishes.
1042	0	a	I adore Korean food, This was my least favorite. For a new restaurant it was dingy and used looking.  Very sparse. The menu was deposited on the table, no drinks were offered only a lukewarm water glass.  We ordered the combo, chose the spicy pork bulgogi, and the short ribs.  What a disappointment. We always patron Takamatsu's but decided to try this as it was new and the ratings were good.  If you are not Korean, the  portions are pathetic, for 21.99 we were given what I would expect as a meager lunch portion.  I noticed that others that ordered the same dishes were given much larger portions, and also given much more personal attention.  We stated that it was our first time, but it made no difference.  What a shame as when we love a restaurant we spread the word.  The same is true for when we do not like a restaurant  only we tell more people.
1043	1	a	The restaurant is kinda hidden in the plaza on Dobson and Guadalupe. The place is small but clean. Service was good and we didn't have to wait to long for the food. We ordered some Gogi, spicy chicken, tofu soup and some Korean street tacos. Everything tasted delicious and the portions were generous. I highly recommend the Korean street tacos!
1044	0	a	If all you care about is taste, this place is good.\nBut I can't get over my horrible experience last time. My boyfriend and I ordered one dish each. I got my dish kimchi stew about 15 mins later. And we kept waiting and waiting for his food to arrive - which was bulgogi btw. When I saw the huge group who arrive much later than us getting their food, I had already finished my food. \nI asked the waiter about it and he told me we didn't order the other dish! That really pissed me off. I distinctly remembered ordering his because my bf fumbled on saying bulgogi and I corrected it. That shameless man cannot get 2 orders right and tried to act like he did nothing wrong...AND made us wait another 20 mins before it came. \nZero apologies and absolutely horrible attitude.
1045	0	a	"Last time I went, we were given poor banchan while the two tables next to us received much higher quality banchan (?) We got beans, potato and some cabbage, while they had kimchi, kimch radish, spinach, bean sprouts, etc. Why???? \n\nAlso kept hearing the lady in the kitchen that she \""found the meat\"" after overhearing the waiter tell the table next to us that they were out of spicy pork. How do you lose the food in your kitchen?! I had apparently ordered the last order for spicy pork, but I was extremely dry and overcooked.\n\nThe prices are also a bit unreasonable. The nengmyn-kalbi combo comes with a good portion of noodles but literally 4 pieces of meat. Probably won't be returning here for a while."
1046	0	a	"i was excited to see that a new Korean restaurant opened up and decided to drive over for dinner. Both the food and the service were very disappointing.\n\nThe service was beyond terrible. I walked in and had to seat myself because no one gave me any direction. I sat there for five minutes and no one came over, so I went to get a menu myself. I waited for 10 minutes and still no one came over to take my order. There were two tables right next to mine, and the female server brought items to their tables while I was sitting there trying to get her attention. After 15 minutes of just sitting, eventually the male server came over and took my order.\n\nFor a place called \""Ban Chan\"", their ban chan is not only very limited, but gross. There were a total of 4 side dishes, 3 of which were odd and inedible. The cooked turnip had a very fishy taste to it, then there were the mushy/flavorless collared greens, the picked vegetable and pickled turnip were just not good. All of the side dishes were lukewarm.\n\nI ordered Haemul Pajun (Seafood pancake); it was thick and full of undercooked green onion.The Kalbitang was very salty.\n\nIt was a very disappointing meal."
1047	1	a	I bought a Groupon for a microdermabrasion. Sugar is very attentive to details and gets every centimeter of your face. The facials are customized to your needs.  Unlike most spas I've been to where they walk out of the room while your mask sits, she stays with you in the room the entire time and monitors to make sure everything is going ok.  The regular prices are very reasonable...$60 for microderm with facial. Only wished I had brought a couple more Groupons.  The overall experience was very professional.  I will be going back for my monthly facials.
1048	0	a	"I was having a problem with my pit bull and I needed to bring it back to the rescue.  The large breed coordinator, Toni, was extremely harsh to me and degraded my character as a pet owner and then, actually recommended that I have the dog put down.  She even went so far as to provide me with a phone number to a veterinarians  office where I could have my dog put down.  Coming from a \""no-kill\"" rescue, I was appalled that their coordinator would actually suggest such a thing, especially after taking the time to personally tear me down and degrade my character as a dog owner over the phone.  Completely unprofessional.\nIt is challenging enough of a time to ultimately come to the decision to return my beloved dog to the \""rescue\"" but then to be treated this way was just completely unacceptable.

We were misled and not given the full true facts regarding the background and home environment of the dog we had adopted, and ended up needing to give the dog back due to aggression and unfriendliness towards our other dogs. Toni not only made this the most unpleasant experience since giving back a dog is emotional enough, but she also degraded our characters as pet owners. She claimed we were liars since she \""has not even seen this dog bark\"", let alone have aggression. We tried to inform her for the sake of the dog our observations to help her with future adoption so the dog would get the best loving forever home, but she is so closed off and not understanding. And the \""partial\"" refund back within the 10 days allowed to see if a dog works out was $50 out of the $200 (which Toni insisted she didn't have to give back ANYTHING due to us giving back a dog, so we should feel lucky she's being nice to give us anything at all...when it's clearly stated a partial refund is given in the contract.) She is not to be trusted...when it was not in the best interest of the dog to stay with us, she would not be flexible to meet for the health of the dog to be returned back...she insisted she was sure \""it's not like we are abusing the dog.\"" She obviously is in it for the money and definitely not for the sake and health of the dogs. We wanted to check back and make sure the dog was okay and has found a loving forever home, but with such an unpleasant experience we wanted nothing more to do with Toni. She's not a good person and does not have the dogs best interest at heart either. \nSTAY FAR AWAY!"
1050	0	a	My boyfriend and I went to look at a couple dogs for this rescue at the petsmart adoption day. While petting a dog, I accidentally called the dog a him when she was female. Wow. The sarcasm from the woman holding the dogs leash. She then then talked to another volunteer about how other people keep making the same mistake. Here's a hint. If someone looks interested in your dogs, maybe you should engage them and tell them about the dog, not make fun of them. The only ones really suffering in this situation are the dogs that won't find good homes due to the rudeness of the rescue. Sad!
1051	1	a	Moved out to the East Valley and discovered scorpions more than I would like to see.  I called, John showed up, sprayed and educated me.  Priced fairly and very knowledgeable.  For sure to recommend!
1052	1	a	Craft beer! Craft beer!  36 taps, all craft and no crap.  Some good happy hour deals and a few weekdays have specials all day long.  Enjoyed my burger and fries and had top notch service.  Convenient that they have their own parking lot in the back too, unlike other nearby beer places (ahem, Brat Haus next door).  Place has a somewhat modern atmosphere feel to it, nicely dressed and polite staff, and it's very clean.
1053	1	a	Would have been a 5 star but they were temporarily out of my favorite beer.  We've been in twice now and each time the food, atmosphere and staff (Amie behind the bar is super friendly and helpful) were great!  Amie suggested the sandwich with yummy pears in it, loved it!  Happy hour specials made me, well, happy.  Can't wait to return.\nPeggy W.
1054	1	a	Stopped in the other day for happy hour and I was very impressed. They have a huge selection of local beers on tap, all of which are $2 off during happy hour. And while the appetizer list is small (only 5 or 6 selections I think) the quality is very good for the price. I highly suggest you try the mignionettes and the fondu.
1055	0	a	I had a horrific experience at this restaurant.  \n\nI went with several friends during happy hour on a Friday and we were seated quickly which was a plus.\n\nThe acoustics are very poor due to the open floor plan.  It is pure cacophony.  Expect to yell over each other.  This was a this was the first of many minuses. \n\nUpon being seated it took the staff 10 minutes to bring us water.  It was another 10 minutes before we had first contact with our server.  We said we were not ready and asked for a beer list that we never recieved.  It was another 10 minutes until someone took our drink and food order.  It took another 15 minutes before the drinks came.  I am not exaggerating about the wait, I checked my watch.  This place primarily pours beers, so the bar back-up is hard to justify. \n\nWhen the drinks finally came, our server spilled a full pint on me.  She apologized profusely.  I was not mad at her, but I was upset with the experience in general.  I actually felt bad for her because it was pretty clear that she was not getting any support from the rest of the staff.  Despite my tables location directly in front of the hostess stand and the obvious disruption caused by the spill, our table was never contacted by a manager.  Our table paid full price for everything, if you were wondering. \n\nThe food was mediocre.  The gravy fries were on point.  The fries were crispy and hot.  The gravy was pretty flavorful and had tons of bacon in it.  There was only a hint of the promised cheese curds, which would have made everything better.  However, if i ever come back, I will get the gravy on the side, because the fries got soggy fast.  The wings were large, moist and properly cooked, and they came out with the sauce on the side.  The wings appeared unseasoned.  The sauce was extremely basic; essentially thick tobasco.  Overall, the wings were unremarkable.  The pizza English muffins were unflavorful and had a mushy texture.  \n \nUnfortunately, the whole experience lacked warmth.  I would have spoken to the manager about our awful experience, but after the spill  I was focused on leaving as quickly as possible.  I am lucky my phone is waterproof and I really hope the sticky mess cleans off my wallet!\n\nOn the upside, the bathrooms and the restaurant generally were clean and pretty well kept.
1056	1	a	"Bye Salty's and hello Union Barrel House. If you keep up on my reviews, I was devastated by the loss of old Salty's, with the $5 Happy Hour meals and buckets of Corona. Well, you won't get that here, either. This is more of Postino's meets Panini. Totally made over with a nice industrial feel. They specialize in burgers and melts. I did not try a burger. The melts are sizable, stacked and sided with fries. They have something for everyone. \n\nThey have several salads. We tried the romaine hearts. Topped with Parmesan and croutons made of pretzels. Tasted great but not going to fill up even an skinny chick. Melts were king here, no doubt, and everyone finished them off with little left and no complaints. \n\nMultiple veggie options including veggie melts which were really good.  Beer selection is magnificent.  Service was so friendly and eager to please I felt like I was in beer Disney World. Amen to the hiring manager. Staff is well dressed and not so rushed that they ignore you. The place is pretty upscale, can be a great dressy date night or a kinda casual night out with friends. \n\nOh, and of course we tried the wings. They are dry rub wings, with celery-carrot slaw and blue cheese crumbles. At first I raised an eyebrow with this \""trendy\"" wing method. But they came with a side of tangy buffalo to dip into if the spicy dry rub was not enough. The slaw rocked and the blue cheese crumbles went. It all went. This may become a new go-to destination when visitors come to town."
1057	0	a	This place has so much potential but falls so short on everything. The patio will be sure to rock in the winter but the place is a deserted wasteland right now in the summer.  Stay away from anything with cheese sauce such as the cheese fondue. The stuff is literally worse than melted velveeta.  At happy hour they have $2.00 off apps. Not a very good happy hour.  It should have warned us not to order dinner but we did anyway. Major disappointment again.  They do have a lot of craft beer taps but sadly the selection is very pedestrian. they did have some good local brews like Four Peaks Hop Knot, Papago Orange Blossom and Huss Scottsdale Blonde but very little to really thrill a craft beer person seeking something more than mainstream offerings. Only had two IPAs on out of all the taps. So sad.
1058	0	a	"My overall experience here was not good.\n\nI came for the first time a couple of weeks ago with a group of 8 on a Friday night. Service was bad. We ordered items that never came, received food we never ordered (and still had to pay for it), and were out of water more often than not. When we complained, the server blamed the setup of the restaurant as being \""too confusing\"". We asked to speak to a manager but that didn't come either.\n\nThe food was average. It reminded me of something you get in an airport (think fast and cheap). We ordered several plates of the barrel top pizzas which lacked flavor. I had a sandwich but I couldn't tell you which one because the server brought me the wrong item and then wasn't able to identify it after. She actually said to me, \""whatever it is, I hope you enjoy it!\"" That was a first. The sandwich itself again lacked flavor. Some of my friends got wings. They all pretty much agreed that they would not order them again.\n\nThe noise was awful. I could barely hear the person next to me. This really ruined the experience for me if the service wasn't enough.\n\nThe only reason this places gets a second star is because of the decor and location which are both great. I think this place will fail unless it can correct the issues with the service staff and improve their menu items."
1059	0	a	Average place, average staff. I can only recommend to go to this place if you enjoy sub par service and food. Good Luck!
1060	1	a	Giving them 4 Stars based on their beer selection, but didn't try any food. \nA pretty Trendy place in Scottsdale with a very elaborate list of brews! We tried a flight and had a mixed drink. Service was a bit slow but the bartender was solo and quite busy. I wasn't really thrilled with anything on my flight, but that's not their fault. I am a bit picky when it comes to beer. \nWould I go back? Maybe. Its pretty far from me, and there are just too many other choices.\n\n*****NO FIREARMS ALLOWED*****
1061	0	a	Another overpriced concept bar has arrived in Scottsdale. No, I don'y want your $13 burgers or grilled cheese sandwich (that you call Melts to make it seem ok to charge that much for bread and cheese). No, I don't want all your 45 taps of $7 drafts and your cute list of overpriced domestic bottle beers and lastly I don't want my bartender to be dressed up in a vest and a tie slinging me beers in a wannabee fancy place. This is a no personality bar, you sit there and drink, but you have no interaction or conversation with the bartenders, they are just robots. The same owners own every place in Scottsdale and no matter how they decorate it, spin it or fancy up the small menu, they all come out looking the same. Waste of a good space and thanks for your big $2 discount on food during happy Hour. It's a company town now and the cool bars are running low fast.
1062	0	a	Poor service and average food. The place is supposed to specialise in beer, the staff did not have a clue about the draft beers on offer and when it came it was flat. We was served other people food on 2 occasions and when the food came it was quite average. I can't say I will be going again
1063	0	a	Horrible uncomfortable chairs, no music, bad service. I only came to meet up for drinks and we all decided on a scale of one to ten, this place is a 4. Not impressed nor will keep this on my radar
1064	1	a	OMGosh! I'm in LOVE with this place!!! Modern twist on old world menu classics. Their beer selection is enormous! 36+ beers on tap AND a bottled selection to boot! They don't stop there either! They have a worldly wine selection and creative modern twists on cocktail favorites! Ambience is spot on to the name. A modern clean take on everything you imagine a barrelhouse to be. Props to the design team, props to the executive chefs and the bar masters for their successful creative vision of nostalgia! And the staff is stellar  Kudos Union Barrelhouse!\n\nTip: ask for the chef's spicy mustard!
1065	0	a	Great atmosphere and nice patio but below average service and really bad food.  Six of us went here for lunch to try it out and were one of four tables in the place so you would think the service would be good.  While the wait staff was very friendly, the food took about 45 minutes to come out, the french fries were cold (not sure how fries come out cold), items that I requested to be left off my buffalo chicken sandwich were on it and overall the chicken and the sauce just tasted like really bad bar food. When the waiter checked on us the first time he said he would bring back hot fries, however, after waiting another 15-20 minutes they never came so we just decided to take off.  Unfortunately I really wanted to like this place and will come back for maybe just a beer but will definitely not have the food again.
1066	0	a	"Came in on a Friday night and it was pretty dead- only two other tables on the patio.  We waited about 15 minutes for someone to come take our drink orders, and the waiter was clueless.  Asked for some beer recommendations (since beer on tap is their \""thing\""), and the waiter admitted he didn't really know what they have and had only been there a few days.  My husband finally just asked for \""anything that is NOT an IPA\"", and guess what he got?  An IPA.  If you're going to tout yourself as a \""nano brewery\"", the waiters should be trained on what beer you offer!  We planned on ordering dinner there as well, but after looking over the unimpressive, expensive menu, and waiting another 15-20 minutes to get our drinks, we decided waiting on food would be too much of a disaster.  We left disappointed.  Even more disappointing, looking at my bank statement today, it looks like they double charged us for our bill....\n\nWent back the next day (friends were already there so we begrudgingly joined them), and the bartender at the bar was incredible rude.  Didn't acknowledge us at all.  Our friend finally got his attention, after about 10 minutes of standing at the bar (which was not that busy at all), and the bartender waved him off!  I was stunned.  He then got our order wrong.  Definitely last time I will try that place.  Disappointing because they allow dogs on the patio and I was looking forward to bringing the pups there."
1067	1	a	I'm liking this place right now.  Been there about 3 times in the last month.  It's much busier when football is on as Old Town is starving for more places to watch the games.  They have a bloody mary special on Saturdays (maybe Sundays too?) that has a mini grilled cheese on top...seriously....grilled cheese..that's amazing.  \nThe melts are good, the variety and changing beers on top make it fun and interesting each time you come in.  \n\nServers are non memorable so far, but the greeter is super friendly and makes you feel welcome.  \n\nThey need to add more appetizer options to the menu.  When groups are drinking and snacking, they would sell more apps with more options.
1068	0	a	"This place has a lot of potential, but certainly misses the mark on food and service. There were 5 of us on a Thursday that arrived at 5:00. Maybe 1/2 a dozen people there having drinks. We ordered our drinks from our server, but there was no bartender in sight. The bartender re-appeared, and starting serving people at the bar as they came in, ignoring our drink order. We waited 15-20 minutes for our drinks. We then ordered food, which took a solid 50 minutes to come. I ordered soup, which I anticipated being there prior to my meal, which was delivered with my meal. My caprese sandwich was I thought going to be grilled- however was cold, and served on cold toast. Our food had sat in the window for at least 20-30 minutes before being delivered to our table, and it was not busy at all. I tried the beer and cheese soup, which tastes like cheese dip that should have been served with pretzels. I took two bites and couldn't stomach it. The waitress told me she would take it off my check, and then didn't!! When I asked about it, she said I ate half so she left it on- I had 2 bites, and SHE TOLD ME SHE WAS TAKING IT OFF! She offered to get her manager \""if it was really an issue\"" and at this point I was fed up and done. Terrible food, terrible service, great beer selection, but I will not be back. There are too many good restaurants in Old Town where food is less expensive, served hot, more tasteful, and friendlier service where I can spend my money. And, take note- when someone doesn't eat something because they don't like the flavor, it's customary to remove that item from the bill, no questions asked. Good luck making it past the 6 month mark in this town."
1069	0	a	We saw the event on Yelp and wanted to check out the Grand opening..\n\nIt was extremelyyyyyy packed..It was hard to even find a seat because it was so busy. We ended up finding one, and I'm not sure if there were even waiters or waitresses because no one ever came to help us. We ended up finding seats at the bar and sat there. So I originally wanted to try their mac and cheese. & guess what, they were out.. Bummer. I ended up getting the Caprese. This has chicken, mozzarella, tomato, basil. Let's just say I liked their fries more than the entree. I think the truffle fries were the only good thing here. \n\nMy boyfriend ordered the union grilled steak burger. This thing was smothered in bbq sauce. & they made it way too hot because he burned his hand when the sauce dripped. \n\nIt was extremely loud and packed when we went. I couldn't hear anything anyone said. The only highlight was getting to see some of my Yelper friends there. I won't be back.
1070	0	a	Decent craft beer selection and frequent rotation.  Nice atmosphere. Tons of TV's playing sports if that is what you're in to.\n\nFood depends on your perspective. If you are looking for average bar food, this will be good enough.\n\nIf you are more discriminating about your food, then you will probably find that most everything is inedible.  At our table, the chopped salad was passable, the melts were greasy, undercooked messes.  My wife's veggie burger was one bite and done awful. Worst I've ever tasted.  Regular burger was dry with an overly greasy bun.  The truffle fries were so dry, and the truffle flavor tasted cheap.  Spiked milkshake was average. The menu is creative for bar food but poorly executed.\n\nService was attentive but a bit spacey. When we mentioned that the uneaten veggie burger was bad, the server apologized but did not offer to take it off the check, which would have been nice, but fine whatever, just a sign of inexperienced and poorly trained service.\n\nAll in all I would go back, but only for the atmosphere, the beer, and to try some of their semi-creative cocktails.  I would never order food again, but I admit that have high standards for food.
1071	0	a	Terrible service. Waitress came back twice to tell us they were out of one of the dinner selections then to tell us they were out of the type of wine my wife was drinking. The orders took over an hour to serve. We waited at least15 minutes every time we reordered drinks. A salad that was ordered with chicken did not have the chicken and that took over 15 minutes to bring. We ordered chicken wings to start and they were never served. They do have a great beer selection so were disappointed it was as terrible as it was.
1072	0	a	Hostess was very nice, but it took 20mins for Mac and cheese with hot dogs. Mind you it was a good starter :) (small but good!) It took 15 mins to get a replacement beer, but it took over 25mins for our entrees! They were burgers!!! And the restaurant was empty and the kitchen was full (4-5 cooks!) Server barely checked on us. Beer selection was good, but if you have to wait that long, not worth it!!!... Overall, won't come back!!!
1073	0	a	Came here to watch a game. Was told to stop cheering for the game as we were too loud. Will never again confuse this as a sports bar. Got the message. Loud and clear. Lost a lot of customers tonight.
1074	1	a	"Ask for Ben. He was a phenomenal server. Gave great recommendations, was funny, and very knowledgeable. We started with the pretzel fondue and it was awesome. The pretzels were nice and warm, very chewy (in a good way) and the cheese was delicious. For dinner we ordered the Union Steak Burger with truffle fries and the Caprese Melt with sea salt fries. My husband said the steak burger was \""scrumptious\"" and the truffle fries were \""solid\"". I enjoyed my Caprese Melt and the fries were great. \n\nI also ordered a Moscow Mule. When he delivered my drink in a traditional low ball glass, I was disappointed at the lack of a copper mug. Ben said to give him a minute and about 10 minutes later, just in time for my second round, he magically had a copper mug. Truth be told, he actually had his mom run down to the restaurant and bring his personal copper mug down for me. \n\nI was blown away by his service and will definitely be back. Thanks for making our night Ben!"
1075	0	a	We came, we saw benches, never saw a host to seat us even though the signs said wait to be seated, we left and we won't return. No love from this place so no love for it.
1076	1	a	We came here to watch Monday night football. The television set up is good. The bar chairs are extra comfortable, as is the atmosphere.\n\nCool industrial decor and a nice music mix at a volume that you can still hold a conversation.\n\nThe service was very friendly and accommodating. We tried a number of beers, both as little tastes and a flight. They offer a great, constantly changing beer selection. \n\nThe salmon was perfectly cooked to medium rare, at our request. We also enjoyed the mussels appetizer and a side of beets.

1078	1	a	It's a fun place to go with a group of friends or family. The servers are delightful and the beer samples are plentiful. Try the tasters group, so you can try out many beers. They always have a wine for happy hour too. We had melted sandwiches and burgers that were delicious and the parmesan fries are worthy of every bite.
1079	1	a	Great location with a really nice atmosphere. It is really spacious here with a ton of bar seats.  We didn't eat but the food coming out looked delicious.  We'll definitely be back next time we're in town!
1080	1	a	I wore glasses for over 20 years and wished this store existed back then.  The selection here is one of a kind.  The owner Sabina is impressively knowledgeable about frames and finding the right fit.  She is extremely experienced and will help you find what you are looking for. Found tons of designer frames you can't find at regular optical stores.  Will be going back to purchase sunglasses very soon!  Highly recommend I2I Optique to anyone searching for unique frames and excellent customer service!  I will be back for a pair of designer sunglasses for sure!
1081	1	a	Great service. They made me feel at home. It was my birthday and they even got me a birthday cupcake. She helped me pick the frames. I wanted funky glasses  she found a great frame.  Terrific customer service. Sabina and Dale were fun to work with. They even helped with getting my financing straight
1082	1	a	I got the Pad Thai because I like to use it as a comparison plate that all Thai places have. Their Pad Thai was flavorful, fresh and one of the best plates I've ever had. Definitely as good or better as Archi's or Pink Kaow. The portion size was big too. Very filling.\n\nThe service was very good for lunch time and the prices are awesome. There is no lunch special because their regular prices beat most lunch specials. \n\nOverall the experience was very nice and that fact that all of it was just $7 is incredible. Amazing place I'll be back to weekly for lunch.
1083	1	a	Having been to other Thai Style Noodle House locations in town, I knew pretty much what to expect and was pretty excited to have a location closer to me.\n\nThe restaurant is cute. Very modern and spacious. So far I have tried the shrimp and avocado panang and the crispy pork and basil dishes. The panang was perfect. Creamy, the perfect texture and flavor. The servings or rice were really generous. We first thought we were sharing the one they brought us and then were surprised when they brought us another plate. The pork with basil was amazing too. Spicy and great flavor. The veggies were crunchy and perfectly cooked.\n\nI'm so excited about this new location and I can't wait until they start offering delivery.
1084	0	a	I had the WORST Larb salad ever at this restaurant it smelled like cat food and the meat was grey
1085	1	a	The decor isnt what I expected from a Thai restaurant but it's cute and spacious. We havent had to wait long to be seated either. The staff is sweet and friendly. The food comes out rather quickly. Their pad see ew is one of my favorites. I like that their steamed rice is a good portion and is a lot bigger than the portions I usually get from other Asian restaurants. Their fried chicken over fried rice is good too!
1086	1	a	This is still a new place but seems like they are doing good. \n\nFood : excellent \nLove their noodle choices. The soup is flavorful. \n\nPrice : Fair\nGreat price for the good quality and quantity. \n\nService: average - low \nThere are usually two waitresses working here. They are not mean or anything, but not great either. If they could bring a cup of water a little bit sooner, I would tip more though. Such a shame. \n\nGood place over all. I will come back.
1087	1	a	The food here is incredibly good. The portions on the plates are just enough to satisfy. The menu is extensive serving most of the thai traditional dishes. Compared to other places, this restaurant is not expensive at all but even if it was the food would be well worth it. Seems like its been remodeled cause the seating booths are nice and firm. The place is clean with 3 huge wall-mounted TV displays. If you're in the area I highly recommend Thai Style Noodle House.
1088	1	a	Those of us that call southwest Las Vegas home know that the Thai Style Noodle House has been a number of different places over the years... But this time I think we have found something that will stick.  I am a huge Thai food fan, and can report that this place meets all the standards.  They offer delivery, takeout and have improved the dinning room to make it so that you don't want to just get it to go. So give this place a try!
1089	0	a	Pretty walking in, but the allure ended there. We stood at the entranceway waiting to be seated while the servers were staring at us from the cashier stand; if they weren't going to seat us right away, a greeting would've been nice. \nThe food was not that great. We ordered the pad see eu which was starchy tasting, and the pad ped snapper, which was pieces of fried fish fillets with veggies in curry. \nWe also ended up waiting an extremely long time before getting the check, probably because they hardly ever checked on us. \nDefinitely not impressed. If you want good Thai food with decent service, drive the extra mile to Pin Kaow or even Archi's.
1090	1	a	I recently moved here from LA and I have asked every Thai or Laos person where I can find authentic Thai boat noodles, oh I should add I am Laos and have had authentic Thai and Laos food from the motherland. Anyways, to my disappointment no one could give me a definite answer to replenish my craving. Until I stumbled upon this quaint little establishment. For the record, I am only reviewing their Thai boat noodles because I can eat everything else on the menu any time I want. Overall it was pretty good and satisfied my craving. I am glad it's near my house and was not over priced like most Asian spots s in SW and MTN edge. This Asian spots charge almost $10.00 for sub par Pho. Rip off! I recommend you try this dish if you haven't.
1091	1	a	Can't wait to go back!!
1092	0	a	wowo, cant believe im the first one to review this place!(well judge by its popular location and countless franchises)  i was here for lunch couple days ago, around 3 or 4 o'clock maybe? and there was nobody here! (its summer so not too many students i get it) then i ordered my food, a 2 combo plater for carry out. $6.79 or something plus tax. okay price, not too cheap, but i got so little food!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! the server use that little spoon, barely gave me anything(not to mention there are not many food left in the wok --- maybe its because its not during lunch hour or watever, the food all looks cold, dont know how long its been sitting there) So i got some Chow mein (noodle stir fry with some sort veggies), a orange chicken (cold and chewy, mostly batter, tiny piece of chicken inside) and a kung pao chicken (which has the best flavor among all these dishes, it was spicy, the diced chicken was cooked well) Overall, I may come back to this place, just because its fast and convenient location. But I really wish next time they could give me more food!!! (speaking for all customer, i believe we all want the same thing) MORE FOOD PLEASE! I HAVE A HUGE STOMACH TO SATISFY!
1093	1	a	BEST TATTOO SHOP IN LAS VEGAS.  With their unique different variety style of work this place is by far my favorite.  The guys are super friendly and does such amazing quality work. Love this place
1094	1	a	I'd been wanting a tattoo detailing a concept from my favorite all time book series, The Wheel of Time. I knew Tone's work from a friend of mine and he did an absolutely beautiful job with freehand detailing that is incredible. I couldn't have asked for a better outcome!!!
1095	0	a	"There is a reason why everything is 2.99 or less - that place only carries the cheapest and poorly made clothes!  Very poor service and no dressing rooms. One of the worst experiences I've ever had in a retail outlet. My advice. \""Don't waste your money!\"""
1096	0	a	"Shoehorned between football merch stores and frat bro living is Postino \""Annex\"", the name of a restaurant ashamed to admit its presence in Tempe. If you want to see how Postino does Tempe, go now before Annex goes out of business. \n\nGone is the hip styling of its sister branches, replaced by CPK yellow umbrellas, sickly yellow walls, and off-brand yellow wine lists. Half the wait staff is dedicated solely to filling water glasses. We got 3 glasses of water before seeing a waiter, who had a very special technique of walking past the table, tapping on it, and mumbling a few things while walking away. It wasn't a full house, and he had nowhere to be.\n\nWe wanted to leave almost immediately, so we only ordered an appetizer, which arrived an hour later and wrong. \""I'll get you a discount\"", said Thomas. We didn't get a discount. While we waited more, I watched him drop food items off the plate and continue to serve them.\n\nIt's possible that Postino Annex will be held afloat by the twenty-something omg-gluten-free first-timers, but the young inexperienced staff and janky decor will keep me at the Arcadia location. At least then I can get LGO gelato afterwards instead of an ASU sport polo."
1097	0	a	Postino Tempe is a new and hip place in Tempe that offers great drinks and appetizers. The wine was very over priced and the service was slow. The inside decor is cool and the staff is friendly. We got the bruschetta plank and were very satisfied however, make sure to give yourself plenty of time to dine here as it took 20 minutes just to get another glass of wine.
1098	1	a	"I enjoyed my time at a different Postino location, so I was definitely glad to see one open right across the street from campus. Like others have said, it definitely has a different vibe than the other locations. That's to be expected, and trying to cram a trendy & upscale winebar next door to a Subway and Panda Express wouldn't have succeeded so I'm glad to see that they are embracing the college town atmosphere.\n\nYou can expect the same stuff that any other Postino has: an eclectic array of bruschetta, a wide variety of alcohol, and decent daily specials. Would I make this an absolute go to for dinner dates? Maybe, but I'd much rather go to the other locations for that. Where the \""Annex\"" succeeds is being an awesome lunch spot. $5 pitchers from 11am-5pm? Yes, please. The bruschetta plates can be split between two people for a not-too-filling lunch, so enjoy the Annex for what it is: a great place to mix it up for lunchtime, and a decent place for dinner."
1099	1	a	Had a very nice dinner here last Saturday night with my daughter and a cousin.  The service was pleasant and attentive, the seating on the patio attractive and comfortable, and the food outstanding.  My daughter and I shared a bruschetta plate, all four of which were different and delicious, and a chicken salad.  We couldn't finish the two things between us; portions are large and not overpriced at all.  The third person in our party opted for a sandwich that she thoroughly enjoyed.  The food is good, well priced, deliciously prepared....  Definitely a nice little place to go near campus...and quieter than Mill Street.  I would certainly recommend it and will be back on another visit!
1100	1	a	There was a time where Postino Arcadia was my favorite location but after my visit to the Annex, I'm afraid Arcadia no longer holds top spot in my heart. Granted their Arcadia location is super cozy and your neighbors can be up close and personal, the Annex location has a lot of space but still retains a certain character that's unique to it's location. I love they have a large patio area, and the inside has large booths for big groups, add the long bar which is accessible to the inside and patio, makes wine drinking and bruschetta boards noshing far more enjoyable. It would have been a nice touch if there were fire pits outside when it gets far cooler to be on the patio but the candle pits are aesthetically appealing too. \n\nI like to commend our main server Nick, he was pleasant and took the time to assist my friend's allergies with nuts and citrus. He's top notch, and an asset to the Postino Annex staff. I think there are new additions to the bruschetta such as the Salami with Pesto which was oh so scrumptious, the pesto on the MJ bread hit the spot! Overall, love the new addition to the Postino family, and looking forward to enjoying wine sips under the tea-lights at the Annex. :)
1101	0	a	"HORRIBLE SERVICE! I absolutely love Postino's so the fact that I have to leave this review truly upsets me. The venue itself was indeed gorgeous however our servers completely dropped the ball. We called and reserved a table for 15 people a day in advance to give them adequate time to accommodate. I would also like to disclaim that I work in the service industry so I'm not one to jump to conclusions, however over an hour just to receive our checks is NOT acceptable. Also we had multiple servers so it was extremely unclear who was \""taking care\"" of our party. I've been to all the Postino locations and this was BY FAR the worst! Not worth wasting your time, if you have the option go to another location please do because they clearly don't know what they're doing here."
1102	1	a	So good! The Sierra Nevada mustard is artisanal af!! Recommended to me by my awesome server Emily. Definitely ask for her
1103	1	a	There was a mix up with our order. The manager made our check on the house. GREAT paninis (get the 9 iron)! Great music and environment. Friendly staff. An interesting first experience but I'll recommend this place for sure.
1104	1	a	Same great postinos in an awesome new location.  Is there anything better than getting out of a late tuesday night class and walking just across the street for the awesome bruschetta and wine deal? No, no there is not.
1105	1	a	Excellent wine recommendations and great outdoor space
1106	0	a	I rarely use Yelp to write reviews unless I have particular feedback to give.\n\nMy experience at Postino Arcadia and Central have been great, mostly because I take advantage of their wine/bruschetta combo.\nPostino Annex is a different story. I went there for lunch (which was a 1st for me) so I ordered the Italian Picnic salad. The waitress was very nice and helpful.\n\nThe description says:\nFresh greens tossed with roasted beets, goat cheese, bacon and walnuts topped with crisped root vegetables in herb vinaigrette.\n\nSounds great right? I'm vegan so I asked for no cheese and no bacon, and instead I asked to add quinoa and extra root vegetables (and I asked the waitress to charge me extra if needed).\n\nWhat came to my table was:\nFresh greens - Yes\nRoasted beets - No. Not roasted, just very soft cooked COLD golden beets. Not seasoned, not anything. My guess is they were from a can. \nWalnuts - Yes\nCrisped root vegetables - No. I asked for extra of these and there were NONE. What they put instead was this tortilla-like strips of root-vegetable colors that tasted like, well, tortilla strips. There wasn't any root vegetables to be seen. \nHerb vinaigrette - Barely any dressing on, was on the dry side.\n\nThe quinoa I requested to be added was I kid you not, less than a tablespoon mixed throughout the salad.\n\nFor $9.50 at Pita Jungle I could've gotten a giant, fresh, real crisped root vegetables salad that satisfied me and had actual substance. This joke of a salad came to my table and when my waitress asked after 2 seconds if it looked good I said yes (it did looked good).\n\nAs I searched for the vegetables and the quinoa I realized they had given me whatever that was, and my waitress NEVER came back to check on me again when I wanted to ask a few questions about my salad.\nA good half hour and I would see her maybe walking by fast, not looking our way.\n\nNot her fault (she was super sweet, very nice, I liked her a lot) but I was not happy with my salad at all, and the cold soft beets and tortilla strips were super disappointing. \n\nSo no, I will not be coming back. No good vegetarian/vegan options and any substitutions you may ask for may or may not work out.\n\n-Julie
1107	1	a	Not overcrowded (yet) but the same great flavors of the other Postino locations. I think that Roasted Red Pepper & Gouda Soup should be on the menu every day.
1108	1	a	"Yay!!! Another Potbelly location!\nEven though this is in a brand new space, the decor is old fashioned and heart warming. Phoenix Nostalgia and more frames the walls on old fashioned fabulous wallpaper. There are several brown tables inside, with a few unique tables as well, how fun!\n\nI've eaten at approximately 10 other Potbelly  locations in the past 15 years. I still haven't strayed from my favorite chicken salad even once. I've never been disappointed, and this location tastes just as amazing as every other time. I order my sandwich  thin cut with Swiss instead of provolone, lettuce, tomato, Italian seasoning, and most important, HOT PEPPERS, aka \""Giardinera\"".\n\nThe staff is very friendly, the shelves and cooler were well stocked, and the prices are still reasonable!\n\nI also had a delicious Oreo shake, complete with mini butter cookies. I look forward to returning to get my chicken salad fix."
1109	1	a	First time, solid sandwich.  Had pizza sub.  Was good but would probably double meat next time. Service average / friendly.
1110	0	a	I tried the chicken salad sandwich. The chicken salad was bland & on the dry side. I also had the coleslaw. It tasted like raw cabbage with no dressing. My husband had the Italian & was very underwhelmed with it. I could get a better sandwich at Subway.
1111	0	a	"Is six inches enough for you?  The quality is there, but delivering it is something else entirely.\n\nA new store opened near me, so I finally decided to give them a try.  They offer six inch \""gourmet\"" sandwiches for around $5-7 (with tax), no sides included. \n\nFor my first test, I went simple with the Italian and the Meatball sandwiches.\n\nNow the meatball sandwich was hot with melted cheese, but the amount of sauce was seriously lacking, coming across as no more than a simple condiment.  The meatballs were flavorful, but dry, and the pitiful amount of sauce supplied could not even begin to bring these things back to life. You could tell the \""meatballs\"" had never even touched the sauce before they came together in the sandwich.  I can't tell you if this is normal, since it was my first visit, but the attempt was not good enough to get me back..\n\nThe Italian was a failed attempt altogether, and I will clearly blame the preparer, and not the restaurant.  As in most sandwich places, as you move down the line, you are asked what you would like on you sandwich.  I told him, lettuce, tomato, onions, pickles, oil and herbs, which he repeated back to me to confirm.  The problem was when I got home the only one of the ingredients that made it to my sandwich was lettuce.....NO tomatoes, onions, pickles, oil or herbs.  I had places that made mistakes with my order, however not this bad, and not with me standing right there at the specific time telling him what to put on the sandwich.  Maybe that is why the condiment area is hidden behind a wall, so you can't see what they are, or are not doing.\n\nFirst impression...not impressed with either food or staff..."
1112	0	a	The food was average. I will not ever go back because customer service was horrible. There was this bald guy who was really rude to me and my friend today and seem as if he hated his job. If he the manager (not sure if he is one). He should work on his customer service skills.
1113	1	a	This is a new place in my neighborhood and I've been there a few times now. The food is great and I love the broccoli cheddar soup. The sandwiches are good I just wish they were a bit bigger. I've always had great service from the staff. Very friendly place to go and they offer up some great suggestions when I've been curious to try something. \n\nGreat job!
1114	0	a	We went here when the location first opened. I had the pizza sandwich and there was barely anything in the sandwich and no flavor. My boyfriend got a chicken sandwich and again no flavor or substance. We were going to eat there but decided go home and add to our sandwiches. The staff was friendly and the place was clean.
1115	1	a	Pot Belly is a nice change up when you are tired of Subway for your sandwich options. The sandwiches are a tad pricier for the amount of sandwich you get, it seems like they have a slightly smaller selection of sandwiches and toppings, but all of the sandwiches I've had taste good. But they do have some fun things you can't get at a Subway, like smoothies. Last time my fiance and I went there, they even had a guitar player for ambiance.
1116	0	a	"((I am editing this review because the general manager contacted me to apologize, and she's a nice lady. This manager is still probably there, so I'm leaving that part there as a warning to others. Everyone else was pretty cool though.))\n\nWe went in at 2 pm, so it was slow. We were the only people in the whole restaurant. Never been there before, so we were looking at the menu. Someone, who I think was the manager because he was older and bald, kept teasing us for taking so long, thinking he was friendly. \""There's a test if you stare at the menu for more than 5 minutes. You guys aren't blind, you have glasses.\"" No one else was there, and we were only looking at the menu for about 2 minutes tops. \n\nI came in for a bite before work, so I was wearing my uniform (another resturaunt from the area). Started ripping my company a new one. He was rude the whole time. My boyfriend and I were uncomfortable the whole time interacting from him. The rest of the employees seemed embarrassed by him. \n\nI got the buffalo chicken sandwich with no bleu cheese. It was decent. Not worth talking to that manager though."
1117	0	a	Have eaten there many times. Although the food is good they seldom get the order right.
1118	1	a	"Yesterday it was raining and their A-framed chalkboard sign stating \""opening soon\"" was still up. I figured they needed a few more days to get themselves sorted, but to my pleasant surprise they were already opened - happily for them and I - on this much sunnier day. \n\nI'm not sure if that's good luck in the restaurant business, but let's just say it's lucky! \n\nI only had time for a quick take out order, but it was a chance to try a fresh baked bagel. I literally saw them baking though the machine a minute before. I won't give away any big secrets, but they aren't using a wood fired oven. No matter, since the poppy bagel with leek and bacon (more leeky than bacony) spread had a warm center and slight crunch to the outside. The center was a little too soft, but probably needed a minute more to cool, but my mouth wasn't waiting on that.\n\nThe place is cozy and truly inviting, with it's eclectic mix of wooden and diner style furnishings. \n\nI'll be back to try the many full breakfast offerings on the large chalk board menus soon. For now, if you are in the area and want a light bite, snack or full meal stop in a share the warmth.\n\nPS The baked beans brewing in the crock pot, had that heavenly scent of a delicious breakfast side, that I can't wait to try. If that smell has anything to do with taste I'll probably be the lucky one."
1119	1	a	What an amazing event! We had a fantastic preview.of the generous pour event at capital grill. We were able to try samples of six wines paired with delicious seafood and steak. Everything was top quality and we gained valuable knowledge regarding the food and beverages as well. Thank you to the capital grill and Lindsey for a wonderful evening!!
1120	1	a	This event was super upscale and classy! I had to come late due to my new work schedule, but Lindsey D. & the crew at The Capitol Grille were very accommodating! My favorite app was the scallop and really enjoyed ALL the wine tastings we received! We also had a meat/steak course and everything was delectable! It was nice to meet the head executive chef! Lindsey D. and everyone who helped put this event really knocked my socks off! I cannot wait for the next Elite event!
1121	1	a	Wine, wine, and more wine! How can you not love a wine tasting event!!!\n\nI was so excited about getting into this event since I love wine! Capital Grille is fancy! lol. We got to try 6 different wines that were paired up with little light bites. We started off with the white wines. I'm more of a red wine person but  I really liked the Riesling wine for this one. It was the sweeter one out of the three. However, as far as the food, I lovedddddd the scallops! For the red wines, my favorite type of red wine is Pinot Noir. & theirs was amazing!!!! For the food, my favorite was the Filet Mignon. It was just perfect and melts in your mouth. Yum! lol. \n\nNot only did we get spoiled with wine, but we got some Yelp goodies to take home with us! So much fun with my fellow Elites! Thank you so much Lindsey for another great event as always and thank you to Capital Grille for having us!!! =)
1122	1	a	I always love going to The Capital Grille for great drinks AKA Stoli Doli & great food. This was no exception.What a professional team! I loved the wine pairings & really enjoyed the samples of food. I look forward to trying a sit down dinner w/the generous pour in the coming weeks!
1123	1	a	Most Yelp events are pretty casual laid-back affairs, but this one was a bit of a departure from the norm. Then again, Capital Grill isn't exactly a laid-back casual kind of place. They do classy, they do it well, and they were at the top of their game for this event. \nWhile I really try to like wine, I'm super picky and my tastes lean towards the very sweet. Even so, I had a great time trying out these different wines. The riesling was my favorite of the night, but my favorite pairing was the scallop risotto with the chardonnay. They really did compliment each other well and I'm pretty sure I could eat a whole plate of the risotto. Of course, with the red wine course came red meat, and lots of it. Waygu carpaccio seasoned with anice that had me almost licking my plate. The dry aged sirloin and chimichurri sauce pretty well convinced me to come back and try their lunch plates, and the filet was awesome. I got the sense that a few of the people at our table didn't like all of the rare/raw meat, but it was totally fine with me.\nThe atmosphere and service were top notch, and we had a great time at this event. Thanks Capital grill!
1124	1	a	Capital Grille always hosts great events and I've had a few other special occasions that were positive experiences as well.  \n\nGreat food pairings with the wines and liked how informative they were; the chef came out to talk and describe the dishes and the sommelier helped explain the pairings.  \n\n\nAll of the staff were courteous and professional and would definitely keep it on my list of great venues.
1125	0	a	The service here is horrible!!  They recently opened within the last couple months on the lot that used to be Arby's.  They have screwed up mine and two of my co-workers orders the last 3 times we have went.  That's batting 100!  The drive through is slower than molasses and takes a good 15 minutes, even when there is only one car in front of you.  I don't understand how it takes so long to not even make an order right.  I even sat and watched an employee check my bag like 5x so of course, I'd assume it was correct.   And fast food workers want $15/hr?  Yea right!!
1126	0	a	The food was decent.i wouldn't put it any higher then two stars my drinks was watery and the chicken was cook uneven.but my sides were great the mash potatoes were good and the Mac and cheese was exceptional and the service well to be continued.
1127	0	a	I love church's chicken but this location is ridiculous.  The employee are super slow and rude. I'm assuming it was the manager had his pants sagged so much you can see his sweaty marks in his undwrwear. I'll definitely be contacting Corp because if that's the manager there's a huge problem. It's weird they are so slow because all the food is already made.
1128	1	a	We have used the services of Trey Boyster of Guaranteed Pest Control for years and have been very happy with the service he provides.  We would recommend him to anyone.
1129	1	a	This dental office is by far is the best dental office I have ever been to and it's all because of the staff! I have been in need of a cleaning and exam for quite some time, as I was driving to Sprouts I happened to stop in to see what they would charge me for teeth cleaning without insurance. That day they were able to get me the information I needed and set an appointment for later that week. Last Friday was my appointment, I was greeted by their friendly staff whom even made small talk with me during my short wait. The dental hygienist, the dentist and the dental assistant were all very pleasant as well. They were able to modify my exam to no x-rays because I am pregnant, each staff member checked on me and made sure I was comfortable while in the exam chair. Each exam room has their own TV and remote for your viewing pleasure during any procedure, the entire office is clean and new. I was already satisfied with my experience and to top it off I received a personalized thank you card in the mail yesterday, thanking me for choosing their dental group! How cool is that!? I definitely felt appreciated as a customer and I highly recommend this dental office.
1130	1	a	I love my Dentist!! The entire 7th&Bell team is awesome. I'm a receptionist for a children's dental office,  so I know how important customer service is. Even with their clean waiting room, great equipment,  and  large picture windows, the staff really makes the difference. From scheduling my appointment to my cleaning to the dentist herself:). I did need treatment (which Dr Dewood was nice and clear at explaining), and was offered to get done that same day. Unfortunately I had to leave after my exam and cleaning, but I appreciate the option. I was given an estimate for my treatment plan and a complementary toothbrush welcome kit:) Can't wait to go back and get my treatment done.
1131	0	a	I have been using Ruby Ride for 4 months and in that time my service started out good and ending with to email of them no longer keeping me as a client.. \nAfter about 2 months I started running into issues with being picked up late,  making me late for my training session with my client.  In the past 6 weeks, I was not picked up for work and contact 3 managers of ruby ride and no one contacted me back..  Ever.. \nRuby Ride took funds out of my account with out my authorization 2 times in 6 weeks.. The last time they yet to refund my funds?  I had to call my bank and disrupt the charge. After telling then I wanted to change my plan and use anywhere card.. It got to the point I went out and bought a road bike to ride to work most the time..  7 mile one way.. I contact management in several occasions and if they did get back to me it was after 3 or 4 days.. \nThis service went down hill quick,  after letting go of some of there best drivers.. And increasing there rates on existing clients after they were dependent on ruby ride?..  Overall I would say Ruby vide is very unprofessional, unorganized, and has a blatant disrespect for other people's time.
1132	1	a	I am from New York, so of course I am extremely picky when it comes to food. Moving out here was somewhat of a culture shock, mainly because I couldn't find any soft serve ice cream! I've been on a search for months to find decent ice cream out here in the desert. \n\nOn my way out to dinner in Scottsdale, my hubby (from Tennessee, didn't know what all the hype over soft serve was) saw the sign for shakes and cones soft serve. I already thought, it must be frozen yogurt but we gave it a try anyways. A man told us they weren't open yet but if we stop by later and they get a machine running, they'll let us sample it. \n\nI obviously returned, eager to taste this organic ice cream. I wasn't sure what to expect but WOW! It was delicious. Very close to a carvel taste. It is creamy and you can taste how fresh it really is! My man finally understands why I can't just settle with dairy queen!! \n\nNot only is their ice cream amazing.. But my hubby and I stuck around and conversed with the owners a little and they are awesome. :) I will definitely be taking the 30 min drive out to Scottsdale regularly to have my fix of soft serve ice cream as soon as they open! I'm super excited :D
1133	1	a	The Oreo Shake is great. I've been thinking about it all week. I'll certainly be heading back for more!
1134	1	a	Sweet sweet soft serve. Family night out in old town ended with this amazing new shop. Tons of choices, really fun staff and locally owned by siblings and their significant others who grew up in Glendale! It's always fun supporting local business, but this really is all my pleasure... so GOOD!!!
1135	0	a	"Buyers beware: They are NOT 100% organic. \n\nMy husband and I were waiting to place our order when we saw the box of cones. They didn't look organic so I asked the woman behind the counter if they were organic and she admitted that they were not.\n\nShe did say that *only* their soft serve was organic but NOT anything else, including the cones. I was a bit skeptical cause well they lied about being organic and are now changing their stories to say that they are *partial* organic. Not exactly the most honest company so I asked to see evidence that the soft serve was what they claim to be.\n\nShe brought out the container and yeah it might be *organic* but it wasn't labeled \""100% organic\"" which as we all know there is a huge difference between \""certified organic\"" and \""100% organic\"".  The first is just a marketing tool (similar to saying \""all natural) while the latter is the real deal.\n\nBut that didn't bother me the most. I was reading the ingredients and stopped at....carrageen. You can google carrageen and get the full health warnings against it but basically there have been several peer-reviewed animal studies suggesting tumor promotion or initiation by carrageenan. It was banned in most European countries.\n\nI tried to explain to them why it is wrong, unethical and probably a lawsuit waiting to happen (just wait till someone with allergies eat the ice cream) but they did not seem to care.\n\nJust another business trying to make a quick buck off the organic craze."
1136	0	a	"My comment is 100% accurate and anyone that chooses to can go on their website and see for themselves that a lot of the ingredients in the toppings and the cones are NOT organic. Toppings such as butterfingers, Nutella and m&m's. The soft serve itself does contain questioning ingredients such as  carrageenan which was confirmed to me by the manufacture of their soft serve mix. \n\nAs I said this is a lawsuit waiting to happen the moment someone with allergies come to this shop under the false belief that the store is 100%organic and they are allergic to non-organic ingredients.\n\nClearly, integrity and being ethical is NOT on the top of their list. My suggestion? Do the right thing: either remove organic from their name OR use ONLY 100% organic products (not to be confused with \""certified organic\"") and get rid of the cones, butterfingers and everything else that is clearly not.\n\nSince I wrote this review I was harassed and belittled by the owner in Facebook, twitter and yelp in a pathetic attempt to mansplain and defend his dishonesty."
1137	1	a	Yum! Delicious soft serve and such a cute shop. I am really a sucker for a well-designed look, and Shakes and Cones has a great atmosphere, from the sign and wall colors to the menu and casual, fun vibe. And locally-owned too!\n\nPlus I loved my shake and got to eat it sitting outside on a beautiful afternoon in Old Town. I appreciated the organic non-GMO ice cream and felt much better about giving my 1 year old bites. The shakes are thick and have your mix ins of choice mixed throughout, so every bite was yummy. Wish I was closer and could enjoy a shake more often!
1138	1	a	Best soft serve ever!! Bonus: all organic, non-gmo ingredients, so i didn't feel too guilty indulging in the hot fudge sundae!! I highly recommend Shakes & Cones to satisfy your sweet tooth. You will not be disappointed!
1139	1	a	Awesome place! Just moved to the area and decided to stop in. Everything was clean, the products were great and the staff was above and beyond helpful.
1140	1	a	This place is great.  The guy that helped me (Damien I think) was super helpful.  I am always searching around town for shops that carry E-licube Pink Starburst and these guys hooked it up.  They also have a ton of different juices from Cali that you don't normally found in Las Vegas.  Great Shop.
1141	1	a	Decided to come by around 8pm with Ex  military uncle and his buddy.  As soon as we walked in got greeted and were helped quickly..  My uncle got 2 batteries and some juice and I got some juice as well.  Their line of juices are amazing and the employees were amazing people they are helpful and they offered me a cotton change for my little boy dropper..  Deffinately going back and I'm from the eastside
1142	1	a	Stephanie does the best I have ever had on my nails, every time, hands down.
1143	1	a	Steph and Amanda are both AMAZING at what they do. I've never had my nails done as artistically and beautiful as Stephanie does them and Amanda is an amazing hair stylist. I will never go anywhere else in Pittsburgh!!! Reasonably priced and the best quality and caring u won't find anywhere else! Love u guys!!!
1144	1	a	First time at this dog park. Looking for a place closer and came across this on the internet. Showed up at 7 am and we were the only ones there. It was very, very clean. Grass was well maintained, and the landscaping around the fencing was well kept. Benches are around the outside for owners to relax with trees that would provide some shade. It looked as if there was lights around the outside during night hours. There was plenty of tennis balls but recommend bring your own toys. I wore out my golden lab throwing the ball from one side to the other in about an hour. Nice place to take the pups and let them run free without worry of running off, or breaking the leash law in public. I believe this time would've been more enjoyable if my dogs had others to run with, but all in all, very good time. Hope to see more and more dogs there once the weather cools off and word spreads about this nice dog park.
1145	1	a	They are new so service needs to improve. We waited for food longer than I expected.
1146	0	a	I wanted so much to love this place! We are in desperate need of a great Japanese Izakaya restaurant.\n\nMaybe it was a Monday but that shouldn't really matter.  We ordered two rolls, I didn't even taste the spicy tuna roll..the spicy salmon we had was not fresh.  The salmon sashimi wasn't fresh.  The uni was ok....I've had better at the cheap rotating sushi places.  The tuna poke was pretty fresh and very flavorful\n\nI also had butter fish, dressing on the salad that accompanied this dish was amazing.  Fish was ok, not great.\n\nRamen broth was very tasty (spicy miso) however the noodles weren't very good.  A little too on the mushy side for my taste.\n\nAll in all I was expecting a lot more, especially for a restaurant that is having a grand opening.\n\nI'll be back to give it another shot, but I think I'll wait awhile as my stomach isn't too happy with me right now.\n\nThe waitress was really nice and noticed we didn't eat any of our sushi, so she took off one of the rolls.  She really should have taken both rolls and the sushi off if our bill as we didn't even touch them they were so fishy\n\nI hope they freshen up their fish for our next visit
1147	1	a	Pretty good overall. Friendly staff and good atmosphere. With the exception of saying good evening in Japanese at 12:30 in the afternoon. Sushi rolls were delicious and needing to try the ramen next.
1148	1	a	"An izakaya in the Phoenix area? Excellent! (For neophytes, an izakaya is a Japanese version of a pub, serving drinks and food- mainly small plates, that are typically shared). We came here on a Friday night, and due to the liliputian space inside (I think there are only 4 tables or so in the restaurant) we were limited to outside seating. Snagging the last outside table available, we browsed through the menu after the waitress came over to take our drink order.\n\nWe ordered a vast quantity of food, enough to feed quite possibly a small army. We arrived just a few minutes before happy hour ended at 7 P.M., so we were lucky enough to partake in happy hour bites as well as regular dinner items. Our array of food included takoyaki, grilled meats, oyako don, spicy miso noodle soup with tofu, \""The hot rock\"", sashimi, agedashi tofu, and a massive array of sushi rolls. Out of all the items, my favorites were the takoyaki and the spicy noodle soup. The takoyaki tasted freshly made, with a nice crispy outer shell and big chunks of octopus. The spicy noodle soup had perfectly cooked noodles, with a light broth. The sashimi was fresh, and while the rolls we had were cheap (Approximately 5-6 dollars per roll), you get what you pay for since they were plentiful numbers of them, but they tasted just OK, nothing special. The hot rock was an interesting creation, which I enjoyed. It had a shitake mushroom base, and was topped with cooked spicy tuna, crab, and eel sauce.\n\nService was friendly, but due to the popularity of the restaurant (There were a lot people waiting inside, and a huge line of people waiting outside the restaurant as more time progressed during our meal), our waitress was a bit absent minded about getting items for us and checking up on us. \n\nThe owner is Taiwanese, so the menu isn't strictly Japanese by authenticity standards. Just think of it as Japanese with some Chinese flair. :)\n\nI'll come back here if I'm wanting good takoyaki and other small bites, and if I'm planning on eating here at a less busier time. If you do come at a typically busy time, you've been warned about the wait and limited seating!\n\nOverall, 3.5 stars for me."
1149	0	a	My experience? It was great to start but ended with big disappointment.\n\nWhen I found out about this place I was ecstatic because there's no izakaya in Phoenix area. Yes, there are sushi and fast-food type places but nothing like izakaya. So, just for that reason I gave it 5 stars. \n\nIn our party we had 4 adults and a 19 month old baby. We sat at a table around 5:30pm and the service was soooooo slow it took about 4 hours to get all of our food. We left around 9:30pm. For that reason alone I deducted 2 points. \n\nCooked food was pretty decent but sushi was not so fresh and tasteless. Sake was overpriced and beer was warm. So, i deducted another point. \n\nThis place is also not kid friendly so minus another point. There was no crayons or anything to keep a child busy and there was no changing station in the bathroom either. Luckily the baby was well behaved and didn't get too agitated but other kids in the restaurant were screaming. \n\nWe had to ask for our order numerous times and average service time took 20-30 min for each order. One of the dish we ordered was so salty we asked them to take it back. \n\nThis places is very small with 3 waitresses and several cooks so you think they have this down but they seemed very confused and customer service was very poor. I understand this is a new establishment but hope they get their act straight so they don't disappoint more customers. \n\nSo, where does that 1 star apply you say? Well, all else failed but the tonkotsu ramen was pretty darn good. LOL!
1150	1	a	I am not a huge Japanese food connoisseur but I do know that in this area, we do not have much authentic Japanese going for us. My husband and I tried this place last week and were pleasantly surprised with how clean everything was and the various options on the menu (their sushi rolls all have a description, I don't know about you but that is a big plus for me lol) \n\nI had a bento box with spicy chicken teriyaki and my husband had the spicy miso ramen with pork. Both were great, everything seemed super fresh and the server was really nice and helpful.\n\nIs it super authentic? Maybe, probably not. Is it really tasty and fresh? Yes! We will return for sure.
1151	0	a	Not what I was expecting. I was told that this was a great place and what I ordered was not worth the money. The service was ok. Will not be going back.
1152	1	a	Nice atmosphere, the tonkatsu ramen was very good. All their tapas dishes was good for the price. Most of the customers that went to eat there were Asian.  Thats a good sign that the food is authentic. We will definitely come back here again!
1153	0	a	One star is generous. Too bad I will still go here because it's close. Happy Harry's was hands down better than these clowns. After you see the job they do you'll feel like you got raped, with no lube, by the salesman issuing wash tickets. I'd tell ya to go somewhere else but up here there just ain't nowhere else to go.
1154	0	a	I used to go to Cobblestone in Scottsdale to get my oil changed but stopped because I was tired of the hard-sell I got any time I went there. Luckily I found Happy Harry's that didn't shake me down every time I wanted my oil changed. Sadly they got bought out by Cobblestone and now you can't even walk in the door without them trying to sell you windshield repair. Time to find a new place. RIP Happy Harry's
1155	0	a	Most recently I had my car washed here. There is a problem that is known in this car wash and has been going on for months. There is a damaged hydraulic line spraying hydraulic oil over all of the driver side of the car. If you have a very nice expensive car I would highly recommend not going . It ends up just smearing in circles and takes forever to get off.
1156	0	a	This place is the pits! Slow, Expensive and useless. Happy Harry's was so much better. I'm never coming back.
1157	0	a	I have been coming to hapoy Harry's for years and loved it. Always a good experience. Now the prices are outrageous and I don't even get a clean car or any assistance to help clean up the few things still dirty. I went to just get an exterior wash today and after running my car through two times I got out and looked at all the dirt still on the car. I ended up grabbing a towel and wiping it down myself.  No manager or other employee came over until finally someone who had gone to the same high school as me came over to say hi and offered to help finish cleaning it. I will never pay for a wash there ever again.
1158	0	a	"Drove in with a radar detector tucked in the door pocket.  Was not there after employees finished vacuuming and windows.  Manager belligerant and unhelpful.  Phoenix police wouldn't even take report because we \""couldn't prove anything\"".  This is NOT Happy Harrys.  We'll stick to Quick-n-Clean in Cave Creek, where the vehicle is never out of our sight.  (And yes, it was stupid to leave the detector in the car.  Never again.)"
1159	0	a	Horrible Service, way too expensive  - Had to stand there with them showing streaks of dust on dashboard after they swore they had used the interior dressing, Had to remind them that their Plus package included the Exterior dressing.  Manager sat there annoyed that I was expecting them to do what it is that they offer to do in their expensive package.\n\nThey will not waste any more of my time nor get any of my money - kids on the side of the road doing a fundraiser would have done a better job and it would have cost less \n\nReached out to their corporate office and got no replay back\n\nAvoid at all costs
1160	1	a	I have been following Stephanie for years from salon to salon, and she landed at Luxe 3 years or so ago.  I met Steph years ago when I got a HORRIBLE dye job and was looking for someone to fix my mop. She looked at me, scared for the both of us and knew exactly what to do. After a few appointments (the previous dye job was THAT bad) she made me look FABULOUS; even better than before! She's so awesome, it's been a love story ever since. If you need a peek, most of my pics are her color and cut work. (The lighter blonde pics)\n\nI even sent my boyfriend her way a couple times to get his cut situated. He always looks amazing, but being a boy he's not as interested in driving so far (we live in Laveen) for a 30 min haircut. For me it's cathartic seeing her. I go in a visual and emotional mess and come out a beauty inside and out. Lol.\n\n I love her, and love how sweet the front desk girls are.  It doesn't take much to impress me... but I have dealt with rude desk people, creepy hairdressers and dirty salons in the past.  I live in Laveen and drive an hour to get here because she and the salon staff are great. : ) I will always sing Luxe's praises. Just as long as she still has appointment times for me. ; ) \n\nP.S. I just came in starving and the front desk ladies offered to go pick up my food if I ordered at Famous Daves next door. THEY ARE SO SWEET!!!
1161	0	a	Watch out for these guys!  Came into my home and tried to fix my microwave/oven unit by jumping over burnt circuits on the computer board with pieces of an extension cord they carry in their toolbox!  Soldered the cord onto the board with a soldering iron and tried to convince me that was an appropriate repair!  Their work could be dangerous and cause fire or worse!  They are not required to have a contactors or electrician's license to do these kinds of repairs.  BEWARE!
1162	1	a	These guys are great. Recommended through the home warranty. The called to set up the appointment immediately. When I had to change it, they had another time slot available right after -- no hassle.\n\nTechnician was on time, extremely knowledgeable and very, very thorough. They've been to our home twice, and they quickly resolved the issue both times.
1163	1	a	really friendly people working here (especially the girl).  her boss, maurice is nice too but she's great!  they treat you right here.  i forgot my credit card today and only brought a debit card.  the girl working here drove me all the way back to my place (I'd walked to pick up the car) to get my credit card and the place was busy.  it's service like this that keeps me coming back to this enterprise location.  the price was a little high today ($52 for one day) but they have some weekend rates that seem reasonable.
1164	0	a	Rented a car here for the day, which I pre-reserved.   \n\nI got there on time, and the person working the desk was busy with another customer.   There was another employee doing something behind a window, who saw me come in, but never once glanced up after that to acknowledge me, or let me know that she couldn't help me.\n\nWhen It was my turn, I declined the extra coverage that they always try to sell, as I'm well-insured, and I was first asked for my insurance card.  This has NEVER happened to me, and I travel several times a month and rent cars all over, including from other Enterprise locations.    When I couldn't produce it, I was actually asked for the number of my agent, which I have in my phone, and she tried to call them to verify it.   They didn't answer, and luckily I was allowed to rent the car, after being warned once again that I'd be responsible for whatever happens to it.  \n\nWhen she went to get the car, it obviously wasn't ready, as I had to wait on the street while they cleaned it, etc.   I had this thing reserved, AND farted around forever with aforementioned insurance debacle, so you'd think they would have at least been getting the thing ready.\n\nHad to rent another car the next day, but went though AVIS, even though they were $10 more expensive.   Had no issues, and didn't have to deal with all the insurance BS.
1165	1	a	I rent from here at least 3 times a month for businees and the service is excellent. Shawn and Marissa are always on top of there game and take good care of me. I could go to any Enterprise but I choose this location because of their professionalism and great selection of cars!
1166	1	a	Very friendly and helpful.
1167	1	a	I have had a great experience at laser away. The staff is very friendly and the offices are clean.
1168	1	a	Good customer service. I like this place!
1169	1	a	The ladies are wonderful here! My tattoos are fading away!
1170	1	a	The lasers are virtually painless, the staff is super friendly and professional and they provide change for the parking meters as well as bottled water, free of charge. Rad.
1171	1	a	Great service and results
1172	1	a	My experience at Laser Away is always positive. The nurses are experienced, thorough, and I always feel comfortable during treatments. Scheduling has gotten progressively better over the years I've been using Laser Away and now I only experience on-time appointments. \n\nThe treatments are effective, but you have to commit to the treatments and be prepared to purchase another round of treatments for permanent hair removal and probably some periodic follow-up treatments. The investment is worth it.
1173	1	a	Wow.  That was awesome!  We were walking down Fremont and noticed that this comedy show was starting soon and figured we'd check it out.  Well, thank God we did!  Hands down one of the funny people I have ever seen!  Absolutely brilliant!  From start to end, the entire theater was laughing hysterically!  I can't say enough!  This is a MUST see if you are on Fremont St. or really anywhere in Vegas.  Make the trip, you won't be disappointed.  You can't beat it, especially for the price.  I'd pay three times the amount to watch him again!
1174	1	a	My husband and I caught this show on our last trip to vegas. We wanted to do something different besides the strip as we've seen that 100 times before. We heard that Fremont Street was a must visit. My husband spotted this comedy show and we decided to go in. I am personally not a huge comedy show fan but I have to admit that my sides were hurting from laughing so hard! Patrick was very funny, witty, and absolutely entertaining. Definitely put this on your to do list next time you are in vegas. I would watch it again.
1175	1	a	Attorney Marc Saggese is totally spectacular! I had left a review for him at a previous law firm and have had to use him on two different occasions since that 2010 car accident - and what can I say?  That the people at this law firm are so great they will become your life long friends!  And, they will get unbelievable, and in my opinion - seemingly impossible results!!\n\nShould you get you need help - go to Saggese & Associates and get treated like you are their number one client!!\n\nTHE BEST!!!
1176	1	a	My husband and I retained Marc Saggese, Esq., from The Law Offices of Saggese & Associates, for a personal injury case,\u00a0and I can say we are\u00a0completely satisfied\u00a0with the effort exhibited by Mr. Saggese and his staff. They handled our case professionally and worked\u00a0diligently to get us a strong resolution.\n\nWe had the pleasure of having Mr. Saggese stand by us from day\u00a0one through the end.\u00a0He represented us personally during our depositions and\u00a0remained a continual source of support during the entire process. \u00a0Not only is he very knowledgeable about the law, he's also\u00a0kind and patient. He and his staff are attentive and respond quickly when questions or issues arise.\n\nIf you want a seasoned trial attorney and a great team, respected in the legal community, who will listen and work hard\u00a0for you and your family, look no further.\u00a0 I highly recommend The Law Offices of Saggese & Associates.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nhttp://maxlawnv.com/\n\nTwitter:\u00a0@MaxLawNV\n\nFacebook: \u00a0https://www.facebook.com/SaggeseAndAssociates
1177	1	a	"I really want to give this place a 4.5 out of 5. It's almost perfect but just not quite there yet so I'll give them 4 as I have to leave some wiggle room for improvement!\n\nI've been a few times so far since it's conveniently located 2 streets down from my apartment. So far, the boyfriend and I tried their pizzas, salads, meat of the day, and desserts. Everything is fabulous and fresh. I particularly like that some ingredients were added to the pizza after it was cooked to keep their freshness. For example, figs and prosciutto. The figs were so plump and fresh, amazing. The meat of the day is always a nice plate that is well thought out so don't get turned off by the steep price, it's well worth it. If you have a sweetthoot has just like I do, I recommend the homemade doughnut. It's filled with a delicious lemon curd and it's served warm with some sprinkled sugar. The apple pie is also great but if you expect an North American apple pie you'll be disappointed. There isn't much cinnamon or spiced to it, the boyfriend who hates cinnamon simple loves this dessert. We haven't had the chocolate mousse yet since the staff highly recommends the 2 other desserts. \n\nPrice wise, the pizzas are average price, something around $16-$18. The meat of the day is around $30 and desserts are $5. I never have much to drink since this is our \""we got late from the office let's not cook\"" joint so I can't give much details on the wine list. \n\nAmbience wise they really hit the spot. It's got that laid back yeah classy feeling which blends perfectly with the neighbourhood. On week nights they will have music in the \""John Mayer\"" category and the tempo increases as you get later in the week and night. \n\nA reservation on Friday and Saturday is recommended, they can usually accommodate walk-ins any other day. \n\nOh, did I mention they have an authentic wood burning pizza oven!"
1178	0	a	Waited more than 30min for my food, workers were in the back eating pizza, not well organized..
1179	0	a	I first tired Nevada Chicken Cafe at their location on Sahara Ave and found the chicken to be dry and the side dishes unappetizing. \n\nAfter reading my review, the owner Nico invited me to the opening of his second location to give his food another try. \n\nAt this location, you stand in line and walk past the food before placing your order at the register. I handed the young female cashier my $25 gift card and she said today we have 30% off so you should save the card. I told her that I wanted to use the card today and she told me I was crazy. She seemed very inexperienced in handling customers. \n\nI wanted to sit inside but the sewage smell was so bad I was forced to sit outside on a very hot day. My friend and I sampled the:\n\nBreast meat- more moist than the other location but still bland and skin had a rubbery texture \n\nPulled pork sandwich- first pulled pork sandwich I have ever seen on sub sandwich bread. Pulled pork was finely chopped and red onions were random\n\nMac & cheese- bland, watery, the cheese tasted like it had come from a packet \n\nBaked beans- artificially sweet, tasted like it came from a can\n\nColeslaw- average coleslaw, I have had better at the grocery store\n\nWatermelon- mediocre\n\nChocolate chip cookie- hard and ordinary \n\nNico was busy but I wanted to ask him what inspired him to open a soul food like restaurant when it is not his culture.\n\nOverall the food here is ordinary and the majority of it does not taste homemade.
1180	0	a	If you like chicken and house music, you'll love this place.  I actually liked the food, but whoever is selecting the music over there apparently spends his/her evenings at every club on the Strip and just can't get enough.  I got stressed while trying enjoy my food and had to leave.  If they change the music, I give this place 4 stars.
1181	0	a	So there was a lot of buzz about the Nevada chicken cafe at the office so a few of us stopped out for lunch. The place was very clean which scores a lot of points with me, however it was not enough to earn more than 2 stars from me. \n\nI tried the 1/4 chicken with the 2 sides of  mashed potatoes and gravy and the feta and spinach pasta. \n\nFirst and foremost, the chicken was dry and the portion was pretty weak. (maybe i just got a wimpy chicken) others that were eating the same thing looked much better and bigger than the one I got. The chicken is similar (but not as good as) the little rotisserie chickens you can buy at Von's or Smith's. The only two things that set it apart from said grocery store chicken, is that Nevada Chicken cafe's chicken is dryer and there is a little bit of a citrus taste on the skin. \n\nThe mashed potatoes were not to different from KFC's mashed potatoes. Not all that great....and finally the pasta, if there was feta cheese on that i would like to know where it was. I love feta cheese and could not notice it in the pasta at all. It was actually pretty bland which was very disappointing.\n\nOther than the food, the place was clean, the staff seemed nice and we got our food quickly.  \n\nI may give the place one more try in the future just with lower expectations.
1182	0	a	I had been to the Sahara location before and was very excited to have a location closer to home.  I went there tonight and ordered half a chicken and a full rack of baby back ribs with 2 sides to go. When the girl charged me $39 I almost fainted, but  I hoped it would be worth the money. When I got home and opened the bags, my order was all messed up. Instead of a full rack of baby back ribs, they gave me 1/2 rack of dry St. louis ribs, the gave me an order of rice I did not order, and the chicken was completely dry, I mean, it was so dry we didn't even eat it. Last week I bought a chicken from Costco that was juicy and tender, unlike this overpriced dry stuff.  The only one winning is going to be my dog, who is the only one who will want to eat this chicken. I believe the girl taking my order didn't quite know how to take orders (after all it is a new location) and that's why I got charged so much. I will prob. Go tomorrow w my receipt (that is not itemized) to see if I was charged right.  Save your money and go to chipotle next door or buy a rotisserie chicken at the grocery store. The only plus is  that the location looked nice and clean.
1183	0	a	Worst. Restaurant. Ever!!!!\n\nThe cashier knew nothing about the menu. I asked what dressing/sauce was on the Chix Pasta. She didn't know and had to ask. I asked which ribs were leaner? She didn't know so had to go ask. I stopped asking questions after that.\n\nRibs were salty. How can you mess up mac and cheese and mashed potatoes? They managed to do so. The place was messy, the employees looked disorganized so service was BAD. Their concept reminds me of California Chicken Cafe in LA but they come no where close. $30 down the drain on a horrible meal. \n\nIt was hot inside, sun beating down so you had to sit in the back area with screaming kids. Definitely save your money...go to Costco and get a whole rotisserie chicken. So much better!
1184	0	a	Went there the day they opened.  Had the three-piece chicken meal with two sides (fruit cup and beans - beans are obviously canned).  It was OK, but a bit too salty.  Music was too loud too.  The manager was handing out Free Meal coupons so I went back again today.  My free meal wasn't really free.  I had to pay for the drink and sales tax.  Strike one and two.  Ordered baby back ribs and beans.  WAY too much salt in the rub on the ribs.  Strike 3.  With this and my last lackluster visit I have decided that I won't be back.
1185	0	a	When you hear of charcoal grilled chicken, you know it gotta be good, right? Damn, it gotta be better than the gas grilled El Pollo Loco, according to the cashier. Well, answer will depend on who is doing the cooking. In this case, NCC has failed badly.\n\nI went and visited their southwest location (located on S Rainbows) a week after their grand opening hoping for some delicious chicken. I was so disappointed afterward and here is why:\n\nThe chicken is soooooooooooooo dried and way under season. Basically they seasoned just the outside of the chicken, so the only place you can taste some flavor is on the chicken skin. The meat was so dried and bland, it felt like chewing glue instead of chicken. \n\nBy the way, for a place that just opened, the restrooms were so nasty and smelly. Good thing I ate before I went there to wash my hands, otherwise the appetite would be ruined. Ewwwwwwwwww.\n\nAs for the cashier, the answer is: El Pollo Loco chicken does taste better :-)
1186	0	a	We came here the week it first opened. What a waste of money... For two of us for lunch, we spent around $30, absolutely not worth it. \n\nFirst of all they didn't have anything we wanted. My husband wanted the pulled pork and they ran out. What would have helped is if they put a sign or blocked out what they didn't have. Or at least mention it before we ordered. No one said anything to us. Actually yes, no one said anything to us till they felt ready to serve us. We stood at the register for a while, the girl running it looked like she was having a really hard day. Felt bad for her. :(\n\nAfter ordering our food, went to sit, noticed entire place was a mess. There were used dishes on a lot of tables, and the floor was dirty. We wiped down a table to eat at.\n\nThey brought us our meal and it wasn't anything we ordered. I ordered a ribs combo and he ordered a chicken combo. We both got two ribs and chicken served to us. In the most unflattering manner. We tried to get it fixed, one guy told me that is how it's served, told me that was what I ordered. Absolutely not, since my husband didn't want any ribs to begin with. I went over to someone else and had it sorted out. They said they would fix the check and do a discount of some sort. We waiting around for 15 minutes for that to happen, nothing, so we just left. As I was leaving I noticed some people had garnish and whatever on their plates. I didn't have any of that. Neither did the guy sitting behind me... \n\nChicken was dry... Ribs were dry... Too salty, like someone had a bag of salt and served protein with it. Gravy on the potatoes tasted like it came from a fast food joint.
1187	0	a	The food is bland and expensive. The ribs have no flavor. The mashed potatoes were lacking taste. The only thing I liked was the Pepsi.  This place should really shut down.
1188	0	a	This place is highly disappointing . The food wasn't good at all , and way over priced !!!!!!!!The chicken And ribs I ate tasted like they had been sitting under a heat lamp for hours. My wife had a wrap and they left out some of the ingredients . Both of our Mac and cheese sides were cold . My wife also found a hair in her cucumber salad . They also started to mop right in the middle of our meal the whole place smelled like fabuloso . Not exactly what I want to smell while I'm eating . And last but not least not one employee was nice or smiling at all . We will stick to chipotle !!!! (Next door and our original choice ) gave it a shot !! We will not be back !!!!! One star only because I had to!!!
1189	0	a	"Very overpriced, very disappointing,unfriendly staff. Food wasn't seasoned so it didn't have any flavor,sort of warm from sitting under the heat lamp. Mac n cheese was cold took it back to the counter, they exchanged it for another scoop and it was cold also.\nNo hand wipes to clean your hands after eating ribs, which didn't have any flavor and the bottled sauce tasted like store bought as did the baked beans.Also very confusing when you walk in as there aren't any signs saying order here or pay here, so don't we know were the line begins. Waited 10 minutes for our fast food to get to our table,no trash cans to throw away paper cups,napkins,no employee was seen cleaning tables so we didn't know what to do with our dirty plates,so just left them on the table as did other customers.  We spent $ 25.00 for the most expensive fast food we have ever had, and we won't be back. We will go to our favorite place \""Chipolte\"" which is next door as we were going to do but thought we would try the new chicken place."
1190	0	a	The food is not bad BUT the manager was walking around the kitchen vaping and one of the cooks dropped a utensil on the floor then picked it up, wiped it off on his apron, and started cooking with it again.
1191	1	a	I was a little skeptical when I read other's reviews, but this place is actually really good.\nThe food was hot. The chicken and ribs were cooked perfectly and the side ( corn on a cob) was pretty fresh. I wished they had a full rib rack combo because I actually preferred the ribs to the chicken, but everything was delicious. The garlic sauce is also a must have.\n\nDon't be intimidated by other comments, check this new location out!
1192	1	a	Ribs are delicious! Chicken is yummy! The staff is friendly and the sides are perfect.
1193	0	a	"This place has the absolute WORST service in any restaurant in all of the Las Vegas valley!\n\nWe had this delivered to our offices and it was pretty decent.  Ribs are super meaty, like twice the amount of meat than their local competitors.  Chicken and sides and wraps were just ok.\n\nI figured I'd go the the restaurant and see what the food is like when it's fresh.  HUGE mistake!  The line was long due to a clearly incompetent cashier who had no business operating an electronic device.  The register was way too much technology for her and had to punch in everyone's orders at least twice.  We order and go find a seat.  There were lots of open seats, but they weren't cleaned off from the previous customers.  Nearly the entire dining room had not been bussed.  We and other customers had to ask repeatedly to have someone come and bus the tables because there was no clean tables to sit on.  The cashier begrudgingly went back and asked someone to clean off the table and gave an attitude that transled to: \""Why are you even bothering me? That's not even my job.\"".The tables finally were bussed and we got seated. \n\n25 minutes went by and my kids are antsy at this point.  We're all hungry and want to eat already.  Other customers looked agitated too.  35 minutes go by and some guy I'm assuming is the manager is going from table to table talking to the customers that are still waiting on their orders and I can see some of them getting visibly upset.  The guy gets to us and asks if it's okay if we wait another 20 minutes. WHAT THE F? He said they ran out of ribs.  How do you run out of ribs at a rib joint?  THAT'S ALL YOU DO! Why didn't the cashier say something before I ordered?  F this, I'm not waiting an hour to eat. I go to the register to demand a refund and find a long line of customers also wanting a refund.  Remember the incompetent cashier from earlier?  I think her brain exploded from trying to figure out how to do a refund on a card transaction because she simply gave up and started refunding credit card transactions in cash to the nearest dollar instead.  I'm pretty sure she got fired for being short on her register count at the end of the night.  \n\nWell that just about nails it. I'm not ever going to this place again, and I suggest Yelpers not go there either.  Get it delivered if you're jonesing for mediocre BBQ, but don't ever set foot in the place."
1194	0	a	This was my first time here and it smelled good from the outside. The cashier was nice and answered our questions  since it was our first time there. Our food came out quickly. There was a small sauce bar. I got \nthe hot sauce: which was basic Louisiana hot sauce, nothing special.\nBBQ: I was really looking fwd to good BBQ sauce but this was basic stuff that can be found in A bottle. \nThe cucumber salsa: the tastiest thing there.\nRanch:came from a bottle.\n1/4 white The chicken:DRY DRY DRY \nMashed potatoes; comparable to KFC. GROSS.\nMarconi and cheese: I read the other reviews and was expecting some good Mac and cheese. That was not what happened. SOO BLAND. EXTREMELY BLAND. \nI'm extremely disappointed but good customer service.
1195	0	a	Tried this place out for the 1st time today and was Highly Disappointed!\n\nI ordered the 1/4 Rib, Leg & Thigh Combo with Mac&Cheese. Although the Chicken was cooked all the way through it Lacked Flavor. Just Salt and Pepper, and  No Mesquite or any other type of BBQ smoke I was expecting. Heck, the BBQ I cooked last night with plain ole Kingsford briquettes gave More Flavor than this place.\n\nRibs were Tough, not anywhere close to Fall Off the Bone, lacked Flavor too.\n\nBBQ sauce, I don't know where they hid it, I saw the bottles of Hot Sauce, Not Labeled by the way, a weird watery Salsa, the Ranch Dressing, and Whatever diced up salad, but No BBQ sauce.\n\nMac&Cheese, I think someone Forgot to Add the Cheese, it was just Mac&Some Creamy salted substance.\n\nAfter hearing about the Sahara location, I was excited about the New Location in my neck of the woods, but after spending almost $13, I don't think I'll be coming back any time soon. Maybe I'll try the Sahara location, who knows.\n\n2 Stars for the Cleanliness and Nice staff, but for a Restaurant, the Food Needs to be Flavorful and Needs to Taste good!
1196	1	a	I honestly don't understand all these negative reviews. I am a super picky eater and I loved the food here. The spice rub on the spare ribs and the chicken were SO good! It reminded me of the home cooked BBQ I had when I was younger. The BBQ sauce was also really good although I like mine a little more acidic. The only thing I wasn't a huge fan of was the mashed potatoes but I couldn't put my finger on what I didn't like about it other than the fact that they just didn't taste right. But the potato salad was to die for!
1197	0	a	I love a good rib so I got a half stack of baby back ribs.  The ribs were big and looked good, but they didn't have that smell or tenderness a good rib should have.  It was okay after I put some BBQ sauce on it, but nothing to write home about.  I also had a side of Mac N Cheese, but as Heather S. pointed out in her review, very bland.  So I mixed in some BBQ sauce and it was much better.\n\nMy friend got the pulled pork sandwich but it looked like a strange sub in a tightly wrapped paper.  It contained onions which was not disclosed to her when she ordered so she had to spend most or her time picking them out of the tight sub.\n\nOverall, this place does not impress.
1198	0	a	Very disappointed!!!! I waited 10 minutes on the phone to place an order. I was then told that they were super busy and my order would be ready in 30 minutes. I had no problem waiting 30 minutes considering I still needed to drive there, but when I arrived I had to wait another 15 minutes in line just to get to the counter to pay and was told that they couldn't make half of my order because they ran out of potatoes!!!!  After somewhat of a sorry, I paid and ended up having to go another restaurant to get more food so I could have a complete meal. By the time I finally got home.....everything was cold!!!!
1199	0	a	Wasn't impressed. I ordered a half rack, and mac as my side. The ribs looked good, and it was a healthy portion, but they just didn't have anything special going on. Served dry, and I don't think they spent much time in the slow cooker. The BBQ sauce was pretty standard fare, and served in an awkward glass bottle that made for difficult pouring. \nThe mac and cheese was bland, very disappointing. And a side tortilla was an odd addition for a rib plate. \n\nIt was very clean, the staff was friendly. I wanted to like the place, but the flavor just wasn't there. I kind of felt like I was at El Pollo Loco. \n\nFor the plate and a Bud Light, I spent $20. For a few bucks more I could have gone up the road to the sit-down bbq chain and had a much better meal, with bold sides and corn bread. With the handful of other BBQ places in town running stiff competition with some real authentic down-home skills, these guys are going to have to step it way up in the flavor department if they want to keep up.
1200	0	a	Horrible setup.  Probably wouldn't come back. Food okay. Doesn't live up to Sahara location. No beef option.
1201	0	a	"To be completely fair, this is my 3rd visit to this spot since it opened.  The first 2 times were higher than the 2-star marks for sure.  The food quality and service was great and the restaurant is very clean and inviting.\n\nToday, the latter 2 were both true.  Nice cashier and still a clean and friendly place to visit.  \n\nThe unfortunate part came with the meal.  Me and my lunchmate ordered 2 wraps.  Both came out looking very nicely presented.  When we took the paper off, the wraps both completely fell apart with ingredients and sauce all over the outside and falling out of the back.  It was actually embarrassing trying to eat them.  We ended up dissecting them on the plate and knife & forked them most of the remainder of the meal.  That's an issue that can be overlooked...maybe only a start loss for expectations being missed.  What killed the other stars for me was about 3/4 way through my 'open faced' chicken wrap, I got a mouthful of lovely crunchy chicken bones.  To add to my embarrassment of the sloppy mess I tried to manhandle, I got to spit an entire mouthful of chewed food into my napkin like a 4 year old.  At that point, both of our appetites were completely destroyed.  \n\nIt only takes one bad experience to ruin a restaurant for me.  Especially when the establishment sharing a common wall with this one delivers quality and service that's expected every single time.  And they apparently have a much better manual entitled, \""How To Effectively Wrap Food in Tortillas\"".  \n\nSorry to rain on the parade...I had high hopes, but they've been thwarted.  :("
1202	0	a	Went here for lunch twice and both times I was disappointed. First of all the manager or whoever he was wearing street clothes filling salads and sides with his bare hands after handling money and his personal cell phone was a huge turn off.. Secondly both time I went I ordered a wrap. They say they're handmade tortilla which is a bullsh%&, each time the wrap fell apart when I opened it and each time the wrap had small bones still in the chicken....... REALLY? You can't even train your staff to take bones out of chicken? Poorly managed!! The California chicken cafe is what turned me into this spot, it's amazing in California. Actually real slow cooked rotisserie chicken, not 1 hour fast food style rotisserie. Might as well be a cheap el pollo loco, el pollo loco has them beat by a large margin!!!
1203	0	a	I'm not really sure how I feel about Nevada Chicken Cafe. The food was a little on the bland side and I didn't feel the need to finish everything on my plate.\n\nThey have an extensive menu of sandwiches, rotisserie chicken, wraps, ribs and salads, but nothing stood out to me so I ended up with a Hawaiian wrap with fruit salad.\n\nThe chicken was ok, but not very plentiful or flavorful. All of my dining companions had the same lackluster response to the meal. \n\nFor the price, the meal didn't really live up to our expectations.
1204	1	a	My second time here and we'll reading these reviews I don't believe these people. Have a little patience for a new restaurant. Our first experience was great, and so was this one. The staff is nice as can be we ordered to-go and literally 5 mins later our food was ready. That fast we were shocked! The reviews complain about timing. Don't kill a place just cause you didn't stuff your face in 5 mins. Enjoy your food. Let it savor and let the sauce just over take your taste buds. This place deserves a good review not angry women hating for having no patience. I have no patience and this place sure did not waste my time.
1205	1	a	First time here.. Ordered the combo Chicken and Ribs, it came with a side and drink. I would describe the flavors as salt and pepper with some additional mild seasonings (there are some self serve BBQ sauce on the side). Both the chicken and ribs were cooked to a nicely crispy outer crust. Just a little dry, so not a lot of fat on either of the meats.  I'd say this is a healthy version of eating ribs. Low sodium, fats, and nothing was burnt. \n\nSo long as this place can stay consistent with their cooking, I thought it was fine and I'll return. Price was around $12-$13 for the combo dish.
1206	1	a	Excellent as always. I tried the Chicken Vegetable Soup for the first time. Outstanding.
1207	0	a	Don't even waste your time! instead, go to El Pollo Loco a mile down Rainbow.
1208	1	a	Love that the food was just as outstanding as the Sahara location. Mike and the Sahara team were also cooking! Great meal - just wish that they had the outdoor cooking ambiance
1209	1	a	I came in for dark meat chicken and ended up ordering the chicken and rib combo (with Chicken Pasta side).  It was wonderful!\n\nI'm glad to finally find a bbq place that does a rub rather than crappy, sugary bbq sauces.  The rub mix could use something to spice it up a bit, but the meat was perfectly cooked.... not slimy, fall off the bone and not chewy... perfect 'bite into it and easily pull off the bone' ribs.  The chicken was cooked just as good.\n\nI'm normally not a fan of pasta, but this stuff was good, albeit not much chicken in it.\n\nI'll be back!
1210	1	a	We usually eat here once a week.  We've enjoyed the food that much. However, I'm hoping last Friday night was a fluke and not a sign of things to come.  The corn on the cob was terribly over-cooked and inedible and the wings were half the size that they've been in the past.  We're really hoping it was just an off-night.
1211	0	a	"My family loves chicken and ribs so we were so excited to check this place out. But we did not know this was a \""healthy\"" place...I guess if that's what you're into, then great. But if I'm gonna eat some ribs, I want them fat and juicy. These just didn't hit the spot. And we spent $50 for three of us to have LUNCH. Crazy. \n\nI did see other customers with some salads and wraps that looked pretty good. If we go back, I'll opt for one of those. At least then the healthy part makes sense."
1212	1	a	This is not the fault of this Goodwill in particular, but apparently if you are a Milwaukee resident, your Goodwill club card is no good here. The cards are city-specific, and you are ineligible to have a card in multiple cities...Lameness.\n\nI found that this goodwill had a nice children's section, vintage toys, etc. \n\nThe jeans/pants for women are not regulated well.
1213	0	a	Swing and a miss.
1214	1	a	What a great new bar to have in the area. Went in last night with some friends for the first time and it was great.\n\nAlthough the beer selection isn't he biggest the low prices make up for it, although the kilt lifter was out and they didn't have a replacement keg. Additionally the $1 mystery shot is a great concept, just don't end up with the cow balls. Also the bartender was great, hooked us up with some cheap beers and was a fun person to chat with. \n\nThe food is also great and cheap. I had the burger and for $5 you can't get a better burger anywhere. My friends had the Sonoran dog and pickles and they both said they were great. \n\nFinally the real draw, for us at least, were the arcade games. There are about 15 games in there ranging from $0.25-$1 but unfortunately a few of them were out of order or working poorly. Also the quarter machine ran out of quarters!  \n\nIf the few kinks get worked out, which I'm sure they will this place will get a 5 star review shortly. Will be back soon!
1215	1	a	My new favorite bar. So nice to get away from your typical Scottsdale bar and walk into somewhere original like the King. \nThe atmosphere at the King rules. I love the leather bar, the taxidermy animals, the chalk board walls, the big booths, and the photos of Elvis. As soon as you walk in you feel totally welcome and everyone is super friendly, even the bar patrons. The drinks are cheap and they have some awesome cheap beers. 64 oz? Old Milwaukee? PBR tall cans? Hamms? Negro Modelo? Check. But my favorite is the brown bag bingo. Mystery shots of whatever numbered ball you roll for a dollar. Once you do a couple, everyone at the bar follows suit and it becomes a fun thing to watch.   \nIt was a Monday night, so skeeball was free, but the pinball was also free and I'm not sure why. We played street fighter 2 for a good solid 20 minutes. On the nights skeeball isn't free, if you get a high score you get a dollar beer ticket. \n\nAlso, The Mac and Cheese balls are amazing.
1216	0	a	This place actually looks exactly like the last bar, but worse with no music. They have some lame video games way in the back - an idea that is already been done multiple times and better. The Derby House has games similar and Gringo Star also does this better. The King is a dark, dingy place with fruit flies prancing around the bar and a depressing crowd of not Scottsdale's finest. Of course, I needed to check any new bar out, but this is clearly not a sports bar with two decades-old TV sets in weird spots around the bar. On this Monday night football game, about ten people were gathered, it was more like a funeral than a lively new hot bar in town. It feels like it has been here forever, yet it is only a month old - welcome to dullsville. Place was so depressing, I had to leave at halftime. Now they did have a $7 Burger and 32oz beer special, but the burger you get for that price (Or the normal $5 price) is poor quality frozen meat. I should have known better. The beer was large and the popcorn was free, but this bartender had little personality. He said they were hiring a female soon, so that will help, but otherwise this joint needs to brighten up the place and liven up or soon it will be checkmate for the King.
1217	0	a	"Swung in here with the expectation that I'd have exposure to a crowd in a chill bar-cade environment, but sadly don't anticipate I'll be coming back. There was no one around (except bartenders) when I showed up on an [early] saturday afternoon. The menu didnt seem appetizing and when I asked the bartender for a recommendation, he said \""I dont know. People like burgers when they come to places like this. It's bar food.\"" Really?? I'm sure if I came in an inebriated state, with a large crowd of friends, not really paying much mind to where I was at- it would be a great place. For now- I think I'll pass. There are more exciting places to check out in the valley for a chill kind of night..."
1218	1	a	Don't let the exterior fool you!  It's quite a hip dive bar inside.  They play awesome music because they don't waste their time with crappy modern music, they have plenty of games to choose from so you're never bored, and they, and they staff are very friendly.\n\nI love coming here every time I'm at stand up scottsdale because everything (except comedy) is of better quality here.  Thanks guys and keep up the good work!
1219	1	a	Like many others we stopped here after leaving Stand Up Scottsdale. We haven't tried the food but the drinks are decently priced and well made. Nice selection of craft beer but not overwhelming.  Service was decent. A few of the games were broken without any signs so we lost some quarters. It's also kind of impossible to play foosball if someone else is playing darts, due to limited space.  Overall it is a fun experience and worth stopping in.
1220	1	a	Went here Saturday night before a comedy show. Staff was friendly. Nice clean roomy bar. People refer to as a dive bar. But I would consider anything but a dive. I enjoyed it there, I would come again.
1221	1	a	i love bulk store!\n\nthis one ain't bad at all. they have a wide range of stuff including plushies for the kids or those still young at heart. its not the best bulk store in town as certain things are pricier if you shop around but it is pretty convenient being next to the market.\n\nplace is extremely clean and feel spacious. it doesn't have the lovely smell of anatol or the colorful look of oscar though which makes it boring. it lacks personality but still, a decent store to go to when one is in the market.
1222	1	a	A very small and easily overlooked restaurant a little outside the city centre, but it offers you a very good Italian dining experience in a very cozy little dining room.
1223	0	a	Out of biscuits.  Yes.  Just out.  Not busy on my visit, and yet my simple food order takes a very long time (remember, this is an airport location with a limited menu and no seating).  Then, they got the order wrong and of course it's too late to go back and get it corrected.
1224	0	a	Very disappointed! I spent $12 on 2 sides of veggies thinking I would have leftovers to take with me on the plane.... NOT! I ordered the collards and maybe had enough for 3 bites! I work for a major airline, and I can guarantee I will not recommend this place! They need to either come down on prices or ramp up the portions!
1225	0	a	"I am a huge fan of the LoLo restaurants, both Phoenix and Scottsdale. I've been eating there for about 8 years. Although the service has slipped in recent times, this new location is an all time disappointment.\n\nThis was my first and second time visiting the airport location. I had been waiting to see it open for almost a year. But I don't think I've ever been so let down by a restaurant.\n\nFirst time (10/12/14, 1:05pm) : I had a 20+ minute wait, when I was originally told it would take 7-10 minutes to be ready. They forgot several items, the sweet tea wasn't great, the \""gravy\""... I'm not even sure what it is/was, and the chicken was just okay.\n\nSecond time (10/14/14 7:50pm): I had a much more reasonable 8 minute wait, but I was told it would only take about 3 when I placed my order. The sweet tea was good this time, the chicken was better this time but certainly not great, the gravy I won't be trying again (pretty sure it's from a can) and the waffle was bland and hard (either it had been sitting around or was over cooked)\n\nMy recommendation is to skip this place and go downtown. If this is a franchise then the charter needs to be revoked. If this is owned by Larry then I'm shocked."
1226	0	a	Terribly slow service. 15 min for a sandwich and nobody else was in front of me. This is an airport, yet the restaurant has faster service. This is the 2nd time, and last time!
1227	1	a	Dropped off early at the airport. What to do? Lo-Lo's or Matt's? Lo-Lo's or Matt's? I'm a big fan of both restaurants, but have tried neither airport location as of yet. Sometimes proximity to an escalator is all it takes to sway me. Lo-Lo's it is!\n\nI was a bit concerned by previous reviews. Harsh! My reaction to this spot? It's not S. Phoenix. It's not Scottsdale. It's Sky Harbor Airport. If you reduce your expectations accordingly, it's not bad. The staff was very friendly. The Lil Jay, eggs and waffle for six bucks, is not a bad deal for an airport. The cheesy scrambled eggs were great. The waffle suffered from being crammed into a styrofoam container, but was recognizable as Lo-Lo's. \n\nI'm curious to see how they handle the chicken here, so I'll back. Next morning airport visit? Have to check out Matt's.\n\nIt's difficult to recreate a local restaurant experience in an airport, especially one as unique as the S. Phoenix Lo-Lo's. Abbreviated menu. Portable delivery. No individualized seating area. Lo-Lo's is still working on it, but they're headed the right direction and I suspect they will eventually get it right.
1228	0	a	"Prestige is the concierge level at the Palazzo. The room are the same as the rooms at the Palazzo but you pay $100+ more to get this level of service. The other reviewer has given a good summary of what you get for your money. That is: access to the lounge with the food and drinks, short check in and check out on the 23 floor, free newspapers, concierge services at the desk on the 23rd floor. We wanted luxury, pampering, shopping and shows.\n\nthe good: \nIt is the Palazzo, go online and check out the rooms if you have not stayed there the SUITES ARE EXCEPTIONAL. Continental Breakfast, snacks (candy and fruit), appetizers in the evening and free drinks including alcohol. \nResponsive to requests- when I checked in they had a stack of newspapers at the desk I asked if they had a Wall Street Journal the clerk gave me one and said they would make sure I got one every day, and it was faithfully delivered to my suite every day. I also got a shower chair.\n\nthe bad:\nThe standards in Las Vegas are low compared to other cities, the Prestige at the Palazzo is no exception. We did not have any glasses in our suite when we got there, and some of the drawers did not work in the dresser, and the nightstand clock was not functioning, at $350+ a night I expect everything to be correct. \nThe lights are complicated, my daughter slept with the lights on in her suite, because she could not figure out how to turn them off.\nZombie Connecting Room charges, they will not stay dead- we had two suites and when we booked the agent said she would drop the \""connection charge\"" if I booked with her right away. They were back at check in and removed AGAIN, at check out because we complained about the noise they offered to remove them... AGAIN, because they had only been removed from one room.\nWiFi is included and worked well in the mornings but not in the afternoons.\n\nTHE UGLY: \nThe Palazzo had a private party going on while we were there the music was so loud on the pool deck that our suites, ON THE 25 FLOOR, were throbbing with the bass of the music. So much so that the TVs in our suites were shaking noticeably, not only could we HEAR the music but we FELT it in our bones. (I have no doubt the participants have hearing damage) I called the desk about 11:40 PM and asked when the music would be ending and I was told that guests all over the hotel were complaining and the music was supposed to have ended at 11 pm and security was already on their way to shut it down. The volume went down some time after midnight.\n\nThe response:\nI enquired about the noise policy when we checked out, \""When could I expect to have quiet enjoyment of my rooms?\"" - 2am. The clerk was very understanding and removed the remaining connection charges and some room service charges. Nice, but really did not address our lack of sleep due to the noise. She did recommend that if we came back we try the EAST Wing as that overlooks a golf course and the Wynn and there would likely not be a noise problem there.\nWe were told that the manager was not in yet but she would give us a call, she did and she removed ONE room night from ONE of our suites and told us if we came back to call her and she would take care of us personally. I have no doubt that she would, and throw in some extras, but I am not anxious to return, we have so little time off, it seems imprudent to risk it.\n\nIf you want to party this is a great place to go for all the reasons mentioned, if you want luxury, and pampering- I suggest you look elsewhere. My friend who first recommended the Palazzo to me, now stays at the Wynn. I may try that or I may just stay-cation at a nice place in San Francisco."
1229	0	a	Save your money -- the extra $100/night is NOT worth it.  The lounge is nice, but really, who wants to be in the lounge when you have all of Vegas to explore!   Also, the concierge service is just average -- but they don't hire foodies here -- just people who know other concierges in other hotels and restaurants.   We had to keep asking them for better recommendations because, in our opinion, the places they sent were just meh.\n\nMy experience here isn't a positive one -- the recommendations from them were just horrible.  However, their savings grace is that they DID get us in to a very exclusive and difficult place to eat -  this alone saves them from a 1 star review.\n\nMy advice is that if you don't need a place to eat a mediocre breakfast, or need wifi, and can deal without a newspaper, then don't bother upgrading.   Other than that, use Yelp --- you're in Vegas for the food, the gambling and the shows.  \n\nFYI, this review is ONLY for the Prestige upgrade -- all of the rooms at the Prestige are all suites.
1230	0	a	I am torn between a 2 and 3... \n\nI stayed at Palazzo for my bachelorette and my although my friends wanted to stay at another hotel I was told the Prestige lounge made the stay exceptional. And for the most part it was great. The service is great. The drinks and food served are spot on.  But the management needs serious customer service. \n\nThey incorrectly charged me for an additional guest... I thought not a big deal, its day 1 of my weekend trip, Ill talk to the manger and they can confirm the guest count and reverse the charge... boy was I wrong. First I spoke with Thomas L nothing, then Peter C... nothing.. finally spoke to another manager and he finally agreed to reverse the incorrect charge. WOW! I mean, Im ordering room service having great dinners and have brought a party with me to your hotel and you are giving me a hard time over $100?! \n\nIf you go you'll have a great service and drinks but be warned check your statements and be ready to talk to many managers before anything is corrected.
1231	1	a	Beautiful suite, excellent facilities and a wonderful pool. We would stay here again.
1232	0	a	I thought that I booked a room with a 5 star hotel. I was so wrong. I had reservation for weeks. I asked to check in early and they told me that it shouldn't be a problem. I ended up checking in 2 hours after normal check in time. They were very stingy with towels. I had to call twice for towels. I guess I'm suppose to take one shower a day. Usually the hotel automatically changes sheets every day. At the Palazzo , you have to leave this card on your bed if you want to have your sheets changed. I forgot one day and had to sleep in dirty sheets. I guess they think people don't like to have clean sheets. If you are a nonsmoker, you have no place in the casino for you. The gondola is a rip off. Only a 10 minute ride. Employees are not very friendly. No icebox unless you want to pay $25. This is a 4 star or maybe 3.
1233	0	a	This is a great hotel if you don't plan on gambling.  However, I like to play blackjack in Vegas and the Palazzo has lowered the black jack payout from 3- 2 to 6 - 5.  In other words they more than doubled the casino's take/ how much you are expected to lose.  I think this is a very scummy move and there are plenty of other great hotels to chose from.
1234	0	a	Room was not ready when promised .\nOnce I finally got a room, it was not cleaned very well, a cotton swab was left on the bathroom floor, obliviously used . \nI then noticed I had left deodorant at home ,I call the front desk as any basic hotel in the world keeps toiletries at the front desk incase you forgot something. I was told the hotel doesn't provide such items. I was told to go to Walgreens . So I ended up late to my meeting catching heat from my boss, \nAlso nothing is free , I travel for a living and it is usual not to have at least bottle water .
1235	0	a	"We booked a room at the Venetian, but were put in the Palazzo instead because they had a shortage of non-smpoking rooms.  They tried to \""upgrade\"" our room to a giant room on a smoking floor, which we declined (duh!).  The rooms are large and pretty nice (nothing is as clean as home).  Maid service takes FOREVER and they come pretty late in the day, which is annoying if you're trying to get ready for an evening out.   The most annoying thing, however, is that they NEVER left washcloths in our room.  I had to call to have them brought up every single day, which isn't that big of a deal but is a major annoyance to have to wait for them to take a shower.  Really?  You can't just leave a couple?  I'm pretty sure the two of us don't need SIX hand towels, but two washcloths is too much to ask for?\n\nRestaurants and shopping are convenient but pricey.  I'd stay here again, but only because the rest of Vegas is more gross."
1236	0	a	The dealers manning the roulette tables get icky and weird when someone is winning consistently. They act rude and create an atmosphere of animosity. Aria in comparison was real good, had fun at Aria. Avoid Pallazo for casino.
1237	0	a	"I really really really liked this place until our most recent trip.\n18% automatic gratuity on room service PLUS a $5 delivery charge.\nRoom service took and hour and a half when they told us 45 minutes.\nFudge cake had a black curly hair on it we didn't see until the next morning. We're all blondes.\nThey automatically charge a $50 \""convenience fee\"" if you overstay your 11 am checkout.\n\nLittle things like that are so annoying it will make me go somewhere else next time. There's too many Vegas options to give mediocre service."
1238	1	a	Being Las Vegas locals, when my family comes to visit they love staying at the Palazzo or Venetian.  Beautiful rooms and views, this place always exceeds their expectations.  This past time my family's room was not quite ready, and our front desk agent in VIP was so nice in calling us when the room was finished (only 10-15 minutes later).  He said he would happily give us a room that was ready immediately, but the one that was being held for us was on the 48th floor and had a spectacular view.  He was right.  It was worth the wait.  Another great addition is the Juice Farm inside the casino.  So nice to have healthy options and fresh, organic cold-pressed juice even when you travel.  With so much of Vegas being about excess and gluttony, it is nice and refreshing to have a healthy alternative.
1239	0	a	"If I could give it a zero star, I would jump for it right away. But since I have to give something to write a review so they got a star that they don't deserve. First of all, when we get to the valet, my husband just pulled behind another parked car thinking it must be a line for the valet. The valet guy told my husband \""you need to pull up all the way up there to the right, you are blocking the traffic!\"". I'm not quite sure how we are blocking the traffic when we were just lining up behind other cars. We are checking in as hotel guests and that's the welcome line that we got from them. He could have easily told us \""welcome to Palazzo! Could you please pull up to the front?\"" I mean is that how the hotel trains the employees to welcome their guests???\nSecondly, which also was the reason why I have to write this review, when my husband checked in at the front desk, they told him that they will upgrade us to another suite in the Venetian towel because the one we booked doesn't have a view. We bought that thinking it will be a nicer, better room. Little did we know, the place is actually smaller, 700 square feet compares to 720 square feet suite that we originally booked. The room does look older than the palazzo ones although the layout is almost the same. Not even a fridge provided which we kinda expected from high end hotels. Anyway, we had to walk across the whole hotel to get to the Venetian towel next to grand lux cafe, they stuffed us in the very last room in the 11th floor at the very end of the hall way that literally takes more than 170 steps to get there from the elevators. This is not what I expected for paying $300plus/night for a room. I have stayed at Wynn and Encore and their rooms are a lot nicer, more spacious and brighter then this crappy room for cheaper prices. On top of that the view is not even the one that I can call mediocre. Just the view of the pool, looking down to a roof of some building and not even partial view of the strip was insight. My husband called back and asked to be back to the palazzo, to the suite that we originally booked and they said they were fully committed for that night! How on earth that you were fully committed when we did reserve our suite??? They said to call back in the morning to check on the status to be moved back to palazzo! We felt that we were being shafted with a lie from the hotel's front desk to make us feel like we got a deal to get upgraded to a better spot when they actually ran out of the room that we originally booked. This kind of service is unacceptable at a 5 star-rated hotels like Palazzo and deceptive to the guests. Now we are stuck at this end-of-the hall hole. My husband got so upset and ruining the mood of our family vacation. Obviously Palazzo put their benefit above the guests' comfort, convenience  and satisfaction! We have stayed at Palazzo before but this stay will be the last ever for us here. Never coming back and we will be sure to spread the \""quality\"" if their customer service to others."
1240	1	a	"I have been to Vegas a million of times and have experienced a number of different hotels.  However, this last trip, I took my entire family (3 kids- 9,8,4y/o) and wanted to find the right hotel/casino.  After this trip, my conclusion is that the Palazzo is the perfect hotel for families.  \nHotel:  This is one of the newer hotel being only 7-8 years old. It doesn't look run down and still has the new hotel vibe working.  The place is clean and bright.  It is located in an ideal location, connected to Venetian, across the street (short walk) to Mirage and Wynn, and the Fashion Mall.  The Casino is on the smaller size but makes for a shorter walk.  I love the fact that from valet, you are in your room in about 5 mins. I love that there is only 1 set of elevators to take you to your room.  I never waited longer than 15 seconds for an elevator.  Lots of restaurants to choose from too.\nRooms:  Very nice and spacious.  If you get the Bella room (2 queen beds) you will have plenty of space for your family.  There are plenty of lighting in the room.  I like that the blinds are controlled by a remote control.  The only thing is that you cannot utilize the fridge in the room due to the mini bar being controlled by sensors.  The bathroom is large.  I just wished there were more outlets and plugs for the new lightening charger. Our room was 10-818 and a short walk to the elevators. Wifi was included in the resort fee ($28) and was pretty decent.  Speed was good but you would loose connection once you went to the lobby.\nService:  Overall very good.  We utilized housekeeping a few times and they responded quite fast.  Bellman were very friendly and also responded pretty fast.  The only thing that was a tad slow was valet.  They wouldn't let you call down to have your car brought out front (they would put it on the \""priority\"" list).  So we would wait up to 15 mins for our car.  \nAmenities:  They seem to have a very nice pool area even though we did not utilize it.  Ample shops and restaurants to eat at.  No kids arcade or hang out though.  Great shows.  My biggest compliment is their workout facility.  Lots of equipment and free weights.  Even yoga and other fitness classes to choose from.  Only negative is that it closers at 8pm.  \nValue:  IT was great cuz my rooms were comped.  \n\nAll in all, a great hotel for family.  I would definitely return."
1241	1	a	definitely my family's go-to hotel when spending a few days in vegas. one of the best hotels that still looks fancy inside and out. rooms are very spacious, especially if getting a suite. we always end up getting a room on level 35-38 for a bella suite, and our view being the whole strip, just right in front of Treasure Island. there are also lots of great amnesties including spa and fitness center. being at the center of the strip, almost everything is a close walking distance. if you want to earn points to receive a free 2 nights stay, sign up for a Grazie card. overall, i really love staying here!!
1242	0	a	"I don't like giving a 1 star rating. I usually reserve that for a really horrible experience but in this case, this place earned a one star rating. I know that is harsh but this place straight up sucked. \n\nThere were 8 of us and when you have a large group it's difficult to coordinate where to go to eat. Someone in the group suggested we check out the Binion and off we went. We stumbled across Benny's and decided to go in since it wasn't busy. \n\nThere is no hostess stand so you walk in and find your own table to sit at, at least I think that's how it works. The middle aged waitress didn't acknowledge us while we were standing at the front. We walked around the small space seeing if there was a table for 8, there was not. There's only tables for 4. One couple was leaving and told us we could have their table to put together with the open table next to theirs. We did that. The waitress came over and did a quick wipe down with a dirty rag that left streaks and food behind. Eeww. I ended up wiping it down with the paper towels that were on the table.\n\nThe menu consists of 4 things. Full rack or half rack of ribs, 1/2 roasted chicken or 1/2 roasted chicken with 1/2 rack of ribs. Prices were really cheap. I'm thinking with only 4 things on the menu, the food has to be phenomenal. I was wrong. Mediocre. The ribs were a dry rub with sauce on the side. The sauce tasted like bottled sauce. My corn was the smallest out of the group about 2 inches long. The slaw was watery and the baked beans tasted like a pound of sugar was dumped in it. I didn't try the corn bread. My friend's chicken wasn't cooked all the way and was pink by the bone so she didn't eat it.\n\nService was slllloooooooowwwwww. My 86 grandma walks faster than she does. It took about 15 mins (and I'm being generous) for our waitress to come over and give us menus and even longer for her to come back and take our order. She left her bifocals on our table and when we were finally able to flag her down she mentioned she was looking all over for it because she couldn't put in our order since she couldn't see the computer screen. Great. We probably waited about an hour for our food. I really wanted to walk out but my friends said to give it a couple of more mins. Luckily we got our food after that. \n\nOne thing I saw that really disturbed me was, I saw our waitress dumping water glasses full of ice into the water pitcher. I know what I saw. She had 3 of the red water glasses, the same one I was drinking out of and saw her dump all 3 one at a time into the water pitcher. I don't know if she was recycling customers drinking water or if she used the glasses as a vessel to carry ice. She then dropped ice on the counter and scooped it up off the counter with her bare hands and dumped it into the pitcher. I stopped drinking the water and told my friends not to drink it.\n\nThere was another waitress there, a younger one but she was more preoccupied with coming in and out of the restaurant. Can't tell you what she was doing but she wasn't working that's for sure. \n\nWhen our very frazzled and slow waitress finally brought our check, she actually gave us the wrong check. We had to flag her down and get the correct one. We spent another 15 mins waiting for her to come back with my friend's credit card. Actually she didn't come back so we went to her. My other friends went to go gamble while we dealt with her and my friend's now missing credit card. When she finally found it she hadn't processed it yet. While she was doing that she told us that the party before us forgot their credit card...uh..more like you forgot to give it back. \n\nAlso there was a young couple smoking their vapor there which I thought was rude and disrespectful. I overheard our waitress tell the young man \""oh you go boy, just like smoking a hookah\""...wow...just wow. We were there for more than 2 hours. Walk past this place and don't do it. Seriously not worth it."
1243	0	a	This place doesn't even deserve a star! They abused my mother let her sit in feces unless myself or my dad would clean her. She pages them takes then a hour to response they are never on time with medication. Now they have released her without her prescription my mother is very ill has a heart condition, kidney failure, High and low blood pressure and severe chronic pain due to her neuropathy. Whoever suggest this place say no unless you don't love your loved one!  I've seen elderly screaming for the nurse and I have helped them. DO NOT TRUST THIS PLACE!! It may look nice and fancy but it's a disgrace and it's disgusting I took lots of pics! BEWARE OF THIS HELL HOUSE!!!!
1244	1	a	Wanting to clear out some older things, I read the reviews here and tried taking some stuff to Manifest first. They offered barely anything for what little they took, but I didn't want to go home with the stuff. I drove up the street to 2nd and Charles next, and not only did they take everything I had (and this includes stuff like Daredevil, Elektra, and Fantastic Four on DVD), but they gave me a really good deal for all of it. I regret ever going to Manifest now. If their selection of products for sale were a bit better, this would definitely be a five-star review. I may come back and change it later if the selection improves over time.
1245	0	a	This place looked to have a lot of promise... sadly, I found it grossly overpriced and after trying one of the raved-about dishes, I complained to find it very poorly cooked. The owner was incredibly rude and unapologetic. Not only will I not be bringing my business here, but i could not imagine working for her (it appears to be young college kids employed throughout.) At a glance, looked great - with a great location - sadly, I cannot see this place lasting long and do not recommend it. I would be a bit more forgiving if the owner wasn't such a rude & unsympathetic person. It's a shame!
1246	1	a	This place is great. Wonderful staff and selection of adult beverages. We requested for the windows open and the owner happily accommodated our request. Plan on going back again!
1247	1	a	So I've been here now for lunch twice and brunch once:\n\nBiscuits and gravy: delicious and a huge portion for $5. Can't wait to try the chorizo biscuits and gravy.\n\nWarm grit bowl with fried green tomato chow chow: huge portion. Glad I added turkey meatballs or else it would have been a little bland. A+ with the addition. Chorizo would have been even better.\n\nDuck confit hash: unique, big portion, fresh. Wish they had a little more duck and a little less beet. Otherwise fantastic.\n\nBahn mi: traditional bahn mi fans might not enjoy this play on the the sandwich with BBQ instead of slices.\n\nMy go to lunch or coffee spot, especially on a nice day.
1248	1	a	"With a name like \""Earl's\"" you'd think the place would be a \""common man\"" sort of place. Not so much--Earl's is a high-end grocery and eatery taking full advantage of its location in the heart of top bracket Elizabeth. Still, if you know what you're getting into, it's a nice place to grab a bite to eat and pick up some fancy cheese--if you're in to that sort of thing.\n\nAs far as on-site eating, Earl's has a salad bar, hot bar, and grill/sandwich station. There are 6 - 7 standard meals plus a few daily specials. These are all specialty sandwiches with high-quality ingredients and interesting combinations. I had the Korean pork belly tacos, which were delicious. The tomato soup is also very good.\n\nService is relatively good, although it does seem like they're still getting their bearings (I think it opened within the last year or so).\n\nAll in all a nice place to grab lunch as a pricey treat, but not really a \""grocery\"" except in a rather narrow, expensive sense of the word."
1249	1	a	Real neat place, lots of specialty food items. A good selection of Southern products. Callie's biscuits, Jack Rudy mixers and the like. Cheese and meat counter, wine area, sandwich counter. The staff is pleasant and helpful to a first timer like myself. They have fresh juice and coffees, breakfast and lunch, seating to stay. I'll be back!
1250	1	a	"Brought back three paintings from Peru that needed to be stretched back on to wood and then framed.  Two of them were quite large.  I went to Michael's Arts & Crafts and their \""special 70% off sale offer\"" was $1,300 to frame the three paintings.  Absolutely ridiculous.  I found Gary online and took a chance.  He came to my apartment at a time convenient for me, picked up the paintings, stretched, framed them, delivered them back to my apartment, and helped me hang them on my walls.  This was all with a two week turnaround and for 1/3 of the price of Michael's.  Incredible.  \n\nThe only minor drawbacks are 1) he only takes cash, which is understandable, but a little inconvenient, and 2) if you are like me and have no sense of artistic style it's a little nerve-wracking to pick frames based on photos instead of having a sample like you would in store.  Still, Gary gave me good advice on the frames and I am 100% thrilled with the outcome.  Definitely save your money and time -- skip Michael's and call Gary."
1251	1	a	I own three quality signed prints that I had brought to several other retail framers in town. I wanted them framed in a quality wood molding with matting, and one piece with a fillet trim. The prices I was quoted seemed awfully high to me and out of my budget. I found Chamber Framer on yelp and decided to give them a try. When Gary Pallino, the owner came to my house he was courteous and very professional. We discussed what I wanted and I trusted him enough to take my art. He returned in just over a week with all three of my pieces framed beautifully. We then discussed where I wanted to put them in my home and he actually hung them on the wall for me. I was amazed that all this service was included in the price, which by the way was lower than the quotes I had received from the other retail shops just for the framing. I was very pleased with Chamber Framer's quality, coming to my house and delivering my prints, and even hanging my prints. I will refer him to all my friends or anyone looking for a excellent framer at great prices.
1252	1	a	All I can say is awesome.  I bought my girlfriend a signed print for her birthday and like a typical guy I  didn't plan ahead so it arrived on her birthday. I thought foolishly that I could get it framed the same day. I tried and called around several framing places who all informed me that it would take no less than a week for a custom frame. Due to its dimensions a store bought frame would not cut it. I was about to give up and just tell my girlfriend I did not have her present on time. \n\nI saw one last framer and just decided to give it one more shot, and thankfully I did. GP answered. I asked him how long it would take for a custom frame and he said it would take at least a few days for a custom wood frame, which was not bad but at that point I was so defeated I had already given up, so I said thank you and waited for him to say bye. He didn't say anything so I said thank you again and was about to hang up when he said well when did you need it by. I mumbled that I needed it today knowing it was not possible. He chuckled at first but then said well if I wanted acrylic he could do it today but I wasn't too familiar with it but if he could do it today it was definitely worth checking out. With some hope I told him I'd drop by to take a look at some examples. \n\nNow due to the nature of the piece I already wanted a very unique frame. So when I saw his acrylic frame it blew my mind. It framed the piece in a glass box with black background with the piece floating in the middle. It looked amazing and unique without taking any attention away from it. It was perfect!  Now mind you it was already about 2:30pm. He said if I wanted it done today he'd have to start right away but he could have it done before 8pm the same day! It was fate. I agreed immediately and left him the artwork. At about 7:30 I got a call and voicemail telling me to come by his workshop at 8:15. I did as instructed and boy was I pleased. It blew my socks off. Just the perfect frame. Exactly what I didn't know I was looking for. He saved the day! I will most definitely be back and highly recommend him to anyone.
1253	0	a	Les points positifs d'abord; le d\u00e9cor est magnifique et le menu bi\u00e8res et whiskys est g\u00e9nial. Le menu bouffe est bien aussi, parce qu'il est assez diversifi\u00e9, on voit que l'id\u00e9e est d'\u00eatre un resto-bar plus qu'un simple pub.\n\nLes points n\u00e9gatifs d\u00e9sormais; le menu a beau \u00eatre complet, une quantit\u00e9 importante des produits ne sont pas r\u00e9ellement offerts. Aucune bi\u00e8re noire en f\u00fbt disponible dans un \u00e9tablissement qui se targue d'\u00eatre un pub irlandais? C'est inadmissible. \n\nEnsuite, bien qu'il y ait plusieurs choix de plats au menu, les prix sont gonfl\u00e9s et la assiettes sont de pi\u00e8tre qualit\u00e9. \n\nLe fish & chip semble \u00eatre fait avec du poisson surgel\u00e9 de basse qualit\u00e9 et la panure go\u00fbte la p\u00e2te \u00e0 cr\u00eape. Les frites sont molles et les pois surgel\u00e9s secs et ratatin\u00e9s n'apportent rien de bien au plat. Aussi, nous n'avons pas trop saisi l'int\u00e9r\u00eat d'\u00e9tendre une tonne de mayo dans l'assiette, lui donner un air plus rempli? \n\nLe tartare de boeuf est \u00e9galement d\u00e9cevant. Il n'est pas atrocement mauvais, mais il faut \u00eatre un grand fan de moutarde pour l'appr\u00e9cier. On ne go\u00fbte plus vraiment la viande. Les frites sont les m\u00eames dans toutes les assiettes alors on comprendra qu'elles n'\u00e9taient pas g\u00e9niales non plus. La salade \u00e9tait bonne, par contre. Elle ne justifie cependant pas le prix demand\u00e9 au Tr\u00e8fle, on trouve de bien meilleurs tartares dans que quartier, \u00e0 un prix l\u00e9g\u00e8rement inf\u00e9rieur. \n\nIl y a trois choix de dessert et ils sont tous 8$. 8$ pour un brownie ''en verrine'' qui go\u00fbte le g\u00e2teau McCain? Non merci. \n\nEnfin, le service est tr\u00e8s moyen, voire mauvais. Le c\u00f4t\u00e9 bar reprend le dessus assez rapidement, on semble prioriser les clients qui prennent seulement une bi\u00e8re. Impossible d'avoir de l'eau sans le demander trois fois, alors qu'on voit la serveuse prendre plusieurs commandes et apporter des bi\u00e8res \u00e0 une dizaine de personnes entre temps. Impossible aussi d'avoir la facture sans avoir \u00e0 le redemander. D'ailleurs, mention sp\u00e9ciale au busbuy et \u00e0 son air b\u00eate. Ignorer des gens qui vous font signe alors que vous les avez clairement vu? \u00c7a donne envie de revenir!\n\n\nBref, on comprend rapidement pourquoi le Tr\u00e8fle ferme d\u00e9j\u00e0 si t\u00f4t en semaine alors que ses comp\u00e9titeurs semblent tous bien occup\u00e9s \u00e0 servir leur client\u00e8le.
1254	1	a	Un choix de bi\u00e8re impressionnant! Le d\u00e9cor y est, le service aussi. Beaucoup de places pour s'asseoir et go\u00fbter \u00e0 un menu original et irlandais. Certain plats ne sont peut-\u00eatre pas assez assaisonn\u00e9s mais on y trouve aussi les grands classiques comme le burger ou les nachos, de quoi accompagner votre choix de bi\u00e8re entre amis. Un pub irlandais dot\u00e9 d'une client\u00e8le \u00e9clectique et une excellente playlist!
1255	0	a	This place is brand new in Ahwatukee and I figured I would give it a shot. I ordered the Korean Pork BBQ wrap, which came with a small side salad with a vinaigrette. The wrap was not very tasty (bland) and was kind of small, considering it was $9. There was only 1 very small piece of BBQ pork in the wrap, which was very disappointing. The salad and vinaigrette were just ok. I was expecting a lot more. Too bad.
1256	0	a	Gave it a try yesterday.  Ordered the build your own salad which with their $3 chicken came out to over $10.  Place felt like they were using a swamp cooler, could not have eaten in so got it to go.  Salad was hot due to the microwaved chicken being placed in the greens.  Honey walnut vinaigrette was watery and tasteless.  Had hoped for better.  I guess AJ's salad is still a better deal for fresher food.  Will not return.
1257	1	a	I went here for the first time tonight and I absolutely love it!! One of the best salads I've ever had!!! I ordered the chicken Cobb salad on flatbread.
1258	1	a	So happy Eric, Vincent , and Tonya are back! Have been going to Eric for years and does an amazing job! FYI Yelp address is wrong but it sends u to the right shopping center so just look for 702 nail lounge.  Great nails and great prices!
1259	1	a	Great salon for gel manicures. Really friendly staff. Lots of parking. Clean salon. They stay open late til 7pm which helps if you have a busy schedule. They accept walk ins. The \u00c9poque Salon is a few doors down if you want to get your hair done!
1260	1	a	Love Love LOVE this studio. The atmosphere is peaceful and pleasant, all the staff are friendly and knowledgeable, the owners are very personable and I've been extremely satisfied with the instructors here at this studio. I never was really a fan of hot Pilates at any other studio but its one of my favorites now! Yin is also great and of course the bikram 60 and 75 classes are nice to have in case I don't have time for a 90 minute class. Over the past 5 years or so I've practiced regularly/ off and on at Vegas Hot Yoga, Bikram Yoga Green Valley, and a few times at Tru Fusion. I really love this spot. would compare it most similarly to Tru Fusion, but on a smaller scale.  \n\nThe restroom/shower facilities really are spa-like. Everything is very clean and aesthetically pleasing as well. Aromatherapy shampoo/conditioner/body wash and essential oil diffuser in the restrooms. There are matts for rent and the towels for rent are very plush :) Water, coconut water, fruit etc is available at the front desk. You dont need a locker for the lockers/locker room they are personalized locking ones which is awesome.\n\nI was fortunate to win a free month via facebook during their opening, then unfortunately kind of got out of the routine of going ... now Ive started back up again using their current groupon deal. To me, the prices of memberships are reasonable and the availability of classes is sufficient especially when I work swing shift so I will be getting a membership once my groupon is up. Im really happy to be a student at this studio! I feel happy and relaxed every time leave the studio not stressed and overwhelmed like how I've felt after class at some of the more overly busy studios.
1261	1	a	Looking this the best place out there for tint in Las Vegas. Not only is he knowledgeable he loves what he does. If you go anywhere else then you making a mistake. best tint shop in vegas bottom line.
1262	1	a	Brian is phenomenal! We're going to him since 2003 and love his service and  professionalism. He does what he say, when he say, how he say. Service like this is hard to come by these days. I highly recommend this guy to friends, family and everyone who need window tinted. Thank you Brian :D
1263	1	a	I recently purchased a BMW 328i from this dealership. The great service I received was second to none. Frank the sales man was an amazing help in getting me in this car
1264	1	a	A group of friends and I went to The Break Room on Tuesday and we had SO MUCH FUN! The drinks were reasonably priced and had just the right kick we needed to get up in front of everyone and do karaoke! Jennifer the karaoke host was GREAT! She had a wide selection of songs and if she didn't already have the song we wanted she would find it right away. The pool tables were fun too but singing Spice Girls made my night! \n \nAnd don't let the star rating fool you. I'm only giving The Break Room four stars because it's not the greatest place to look at, but don't judge a book by it's cover people!\n\n#TwoThumbsUp
1265	1	a	i decently priced bar with surprisingly good food for a great price. free pool during the weekdays and a galaga cab alongside a good pinball machine (if they get it fixed lol)\n\nthe sandwiches are killer, good stuff here. definitely not for people who are used to quiet bars though
1266	0	a	Not a huge fan - but I am not a huge fan of Walmart in general so theres that. Overcrowded, crazy, meh customer service, store was not super clean. I wont be back unless I have to.
1267	0	a	"This is one of those stores where you hate going but you have to. Walmart is a disgusting store expecially this one , this store is dirty, has a prostitute motel in front and also attracts the crazies. I cannot stand Walmart and will avoid it whenever I can. \n\nIf you need help with ANYTHING in the store I garuntee you can look up on your phone on how to build it or find it faster then the employees can think of whats going on. And the \""management team\"" is always never to be found . YAY for the biggest company in the world."
1268	0	a	This walmart may carry everything under the sun, but let me tell you about the hair I found on my sliced deli meats. This guy gave me a sample with hair on it. When I told him he just smiled. Thanks walmart for continuing to suck!
1269	0	a	I'm less impressed with the way this place is run every time I have to visit.  Today I went in to find  a training collar for our puppy,  and to my dismay,  all of the collars were in a maniacal pile below where they should be hanging,  like a twisted cloth and metal trash heap.  Is it bad management or lazy employees?  SOMEBODY isn't paying attention.  The self check outs are always having problems,  and they should all take cards AND Cash.
1270	1	a	I been to this Walmart a million times. What I like is the fact that they slice cheese and other goodies. They will give u FREE samples :) \nI'm still doing the cabbage patch and dancing around because I had free samples of cheese and turkey. The bakery is clean and all the employees are super kind. This Walmart has sure improved with in the last year. I no longer live in Henderson I live in Las Vegas but its worth the drive to come here. Oh and no long lines they have more then 3 cashiers... hmmmm I like the new changes that have been made to this store.
1271	0	a	Wow ! Day after Xmas and only 4 regular registers open. Lines are at least 20 deep. This is why I hate coming to Walmart
1272	0	a	ghetto walmart from hell\n\nstore is actually pretty nice inside\n\nstaff is friendly\n\nbut....... the creepy people that approach you in the parking lot are enough to keep me from ever coming here again\n\nseriously a minimum of two people are lurking next to your car when you come out, and they are quick to get nasty with you if you don't have any change to give them
1273	1	a	I had never been to one of these locations and was pleasantly surprised. It's all the good things about Walmart's grocery section without the hassle of EVERYTHING ELSE in the way. You can get in, pick up your produce and other food needs, and then get to a register. The register never has a line. BEAUTIFUL! This has simplified the grocery experience. Walmart prices and quality without having to wait for someone in front of you to check out with 5 items from every section in the entire store.
1274	0	a	I was checking out of this store and a cashier was eating fried chicken while handling my items. Gross!
1275	0	a	I don't like this Walmart food store at all. Its not safe to come here. Plus The staff is not customer friendly. There's never more than one or two cashiers open. It's not worth coming here and dealing with the bad staff and creepy/crazy people who hang out here. It is not a safe place!!
1276	0	a	"This Walmart Neighborhood Market is convenient for me, but despite the proximity, I do not enjoy going here.  Grabbing some basics is fine (apples, milk, toilet paper), but procuring anything out of the ordinary is more challenging.  (insert sarcasm)  Case in point: my husband decided to make blueberry bran muffins and needed some wheat bran.  He goes to this Walmart, assuming that it would carry bran.  After a futile search, he asks an employee where the bran is and she just looked blankly at him.  The following is the conversation he had with said employee:\n\n\""Bran?\"" \n\""Yes, you know, as in bran muffin bran?\""  \n\""OH!  The muffin stuff is in the baking aisle.  You can find all the mixes there.\""  \n\""Uh, I'm making bran muffins from scratch and need wheat bran.  Oat bran is also good if you don't have bran.\""\n\""We don't carry bran.  You'll have to go to a specialty baking shop for that.\""\n\n*crickets*\n\nHe made plain blueberry muffins instead.\n\nAnother gripe I have about this Walmart is the self-checkout register.  Every single time I go, the sensor goes berserk and shuts down, necessitating an employee to punch in his/her code to prevent a total meltdown.  And if you want to use your own shopping bags at the self-checkout?  Good luck.  \n\nStore clerks are generally pleasant, if their zen-meets-zombie-like state can be classified as pleasant.  \n\nPrices are what anyone would expect from a Walmart: inexpensive.\n\nSigh.\n\n(Tip: the code for bulk carrots is 4562.)"
1277	0	a	Came here out of convenience...\n\n\nPharmacy had me wait 30 minutes told me my prescription was 80 went to pick it up and it was magically $130 \n\n\nMisinforming patients and showed no concern for their lack of knowledge, stick to the real pharmacies not a company trying to maximize income
1278	1	a	This is typically the Walmart location I end up at based on convenience. \n\nThe service is typically good and the lines can be busy on weekends during peak times, but for the most part, the store keeps their lines to a minimum by opening more registers when they are busiest. This is especially helpful during he holidays. I recently noticed the signs at the registers saying they will open a new register any time there are more than three people in the line waiting.\n\nThey keep a good amount of stock on the shelves and they are clean and organized as well.
1279	1	a	I love the new receipt catcher that walmart offers, it compares the prices that you paid at walmart to the neighboring prices and if they have it less walmart gives you back the difference on and e-card.  I have so far gotten back 13.00 dollars in savings, yah.  Give it a try ,\n\nxoxox happy yelping
1280	0	a	This store is the best of the worst, and this company has to be one of the most frustrating on earth to deal with, mainly due to them combing the darkest cracks of the earth for the stupidest window lickers possible to employ. Every time I have to go to one of their locations, I have an experience with an employee that makes me question how these people can even breath on their own. After I stood in line for 20 minutes waiting for the employee at the automotive checkout counter to find out how much something was (after telling him the exact price, what it was, and what department it was from), to be told I had to go roam the store and figure it out on my own. Unbeatable....stupidity, not prices. I only wish that there weren't certain things I had to go here for sometimes, so I could avoid this place completely.
1281	0	a	So ordered at 7pm. Pizza still not here and it's 8:50.  delivery time 8:05-8:15. Right :/ maybe I'll get it before the 2 hour marker.  Never have had it take this long usually here faster than given time. Not happy
1282	0	a	Stay clear of this place - mixed up orders - unprofessional - bad customer service.  Don't bother calling in an order because when you arrive it will not be ready.  Even when the staff admits the error nothing is done to better the situation - discount or attempt to get you to return as a customer.  \n\nStay clear - you have been warned
1283	0	a	People love this place.  I am just not a fan of their pizza.  Then again, I am an ex-New Yorker!
1284	1	a	One of the best pizza i had on the west coast\nThey have a great deal buy 18inch pizza and a 12 inch free and then collect 12 coupons for 50% off any pizza
1285	1	a	Zach is a great trainer who helps you no matter what stage your at. He helps you achieve your goals and is a great motivator. He is flexible and willing to work with you. He doesn't have that macho attitude other trainers have. He's willing to go the extra mile if you are as well! :)
1286	1	a	Out of over 5 personal trainers that I have experienced, Zach is by far the most encouraging, knowledgeable and offers advice so that you can work out and eat right on your own time.  The group workouts are great too, especially if you need the motivation to keep going.  He is great with kids too.  We sent our 10 year old daughter to him for agility training to help her with tennis.
1287	1	a	I've never met such a knowledgable and friendly management staff. Results are better than anything I have ever experienced. Everything is tailored to your your body type, goals, age, etc.
1288	1	a	KFC! Korean Fried Chicken hits Pittsburgh!\n\nFor some of you, these are going to be some of the best wings you have had...ever. This is KFC, double fried for crispyness and smothered in a glorious sauce, either sweet and spicy or soy garlic. These are not your typical bar hot wings: these are almost double the size, bursting with flavor. Cut the spiciness with some pickled radishes, and then go for some more. \n\nchick'n and bubbly is currently in its soft opening, offering bubble tea and wings. Grand opening with be 8/25/14, where they will offer their full menu, including various katsus. \n\nThe space is small, only a few seats and tables, so for now, take out is your best bet.\n\nI tried their black milk bubble tea- very, very good(if you see my previous reviews I love bubble tea). The tapioca pearls are sweet and chewy.\n\nIs this like Bonchon or Kyochon, the famous KFC chains from Korea? Not exactly, but it is equally as good, and the wings are a bit bigger. \n\nIf you've never tried KFC, this is the place to do it!
1289	1	a	I went during their soft opening, so the menu was still limited. I'm hoping to try some of their other menu options after their grand opening at the end of august.\n\nThe chicken is double fried and is delicious.  You can choose from wings, drumsticks, or a combination of both and choose from a sweet and sour or a soy garlic sauce. The wings and drumsticks were a good size and I had the sweet and spicy sauce, which was very tasty, but made a bit of a sticky mess (be sure to ask for a few extra napkins).  They will spice up the sweet and sour sauce, so be sure to ask for that if you like it hot. It sits a bit heavy, so I found that the snack size was perfect for one person.  It does take a few minutes for them to prepare the chicken. So be prepared to wait a few, but it's worth the wait.\n\nThe bubble milk tea was some of the tastiest I've had. The tapioca bubbles are prepared fresh every couple of hours and the tea was very flavorful.  They made the tea quickly, so I was able hang out and sip it while they finished up my chicken. \n\nThe bubble tea cups even have a sealed top in case you're trying to carry a bunch of them at once, no leaking possible.  This is important, because this is mostly a take out joint.  There are only a couple tables inside, but when the weather is nice, there are lots of good places to sit outside and eat within a block of the restaurant.
1290	1	a	This Korean chicken store is awesome!! I am Korean, and I think their chicken is the best one I have ever had! The chicken is very crispy and tender. I heard that they use vegetable oil not shortening, and also the chicken is made with fresh chicken. I am so impressed with their food.:)
1291	0	a	My husband and I love Korean food so we were super excited to try this place, especially after all the great reviews. Perhaps our wings were made wrong but these were not good. We each took one bite, he spit it out on a napkin and I made a face of disgust as I swallowed it. We ended up throwing them away, I don't believe we have ever done that before. They were soggy, overly sweet and tasted like paper, I really  I don't  know how else to describe it. The only reason why I'm giving this place two stars is because my strawberry milk tea was good.
1292	0	a	They need to speed up their food prep time or something needs to change. Waiting more than 30 Mins every time I get here...it's not THAT worth of quality.
1293	0	a	Too long of a wait for your food.  I was on my lunch hour and waited 25 minutes for food.  They need to speed up their food service for a to go restaurant.
1294	1	a	The only reason why this is getting four stars is because they have a limited menu. But if you are looking for some out of this world fried chicken you should go! Make sure you get a side of pickled radishes and Takoyaki!
1295	1	a	Finding good bubble tea in Pittsburgh is not easy, but this place does well with theirs. I like that they have the option of green tea jelly, it different. I just wish they had coffee jelly. They also sell Korean chicken, which I haven't tried. They just need more workers or blenders. One worker on the register and one making drinks to speed things along. Next time you're in Oakland try it out!
1296	1	a	I've had life changing chicken before (see my review of Bolton's Hot Chicken in Nashville), but this is the GOOD kind of momentous chicken.\n\nChick'n Bubbly's Korean Fried Chicken is THE BEST. SO FREAKING GOOD. It's the perfect level of crisp fried-ness. It's like crispy fluffy heavenly clouds of coating around the chicken with the most delicious soy garlic sauce perfectly glazed like a silver lining around the aforementioned delicious coating. Yep, I've come up with the perfect metaphor now, it's like throwing heaven in a deep fryer and coating it with savory asian sauce.\n\nDear lord, you need to eat here (yes God, you need to eat here too). A couple of side notes, the soy garlic sauce is the best, you can get extra spicy sauce on the side to douse them with too (I do that, it is so yummy), and the daikon is the fresh kind, not like at sushi places.\n\nMy favorite thing to do for lunch when here? Place my order for a small size of wings, go next door to Oishii and get Kimchi and Wakame Salad for my sides :)\n\nPlease note, never get the french fries here. Literally the worst of my life, but the chicken is so good I can't bear to give them less than 5 stars.
1297	0	a	Fletcher Jones had its issues but this place just sucks. Drive up to service that includes obnoxious techs, that once the realize you have an appointment, won't help you if you were bleeding. There is a coordinator dressed like a Fremont Street hooker. Service writer tried some over played, cheesy up sell that was plain nauseating.  Can't wait to see what the service tech comes up with. Unfriendly,  unrefined, and ready to cater to the bottom of the barrel in Vegas. Steer clear of this place. Been coming here for years and wouldn't dream of coming back.  You can see its trying to be slick, but it's just scaly and rancid.\n\nBy the way. A service writer and the hooker were admonishing an old lady behind her back because she wasn't sure if she should take the crappy up sell. In front of me. Pathetic.
1298	1	a	Nice lady in the service area was very helpful with my oil change. Took advantage of the $24.95 deal and was out of there very quickly.
1299	0	a	We bought a car for cash at this place and they forced us to pull our credit saying it would be a soft pull just to verify identity and would not effect our score. But in fact they made a hard inquiry on our credit that says we were trying to apply for financing with them. When this was brought up to their attention, initially were refusing to do anything, then they said they would talk to their IT department and get back to us, never heard back from them again. Buyer beware!
1300	0	a	"Most of the sales consultants did not greet you, they walked away from you as if they were too busy with other stuff, and treat my family like we were \""air\"". They did not show enthusiastic to try to make a first initial greeting on new clients. Then I have to walk up to a sales (after 10 minutes searching vehicles in their lot). The sales was friendly but service was OK.  I did not think sales consultants in this dealership would be willing to work with me on my need regarding the specs of the car that I want.  So instead of purchasing a car in this dealership, I went to Findlay Toyota and purchased a 2015 Toyota Sienna last week after just spent 2 hours of talking to the sales consultant in Findlay Toyota  ."
1301	1	a	Lucky is amazing!!  We purchased a certificate that she had donated to the school fundraiser.  The menu that she provides has many wonderful items to choose from.  She came to our house prepared and ready to feed our family.  We chose the Pad Prik King and her Signature Fried Rice.. Phenomenal!!!  Her fried rice was so good we signed up our daughters to attend her FREE children's fried rice cooking class.  You can tell Lucky loves to cook.  She has a huge heart for our community, so reach out to her for your next meal or to take one of her wonderful cooking classes.
1302	1	a	What a great personal chef experience! Trained at a culinary school in Thailand, Lucky brings technique, great service, and a delicious dining experience to the -- heh-heh -- table. Would def recommend for a super fun and tasty night.
1303	1	a	We recently hired Lucky and two waiters for a birthday party at our house. They showed up on time and got everything set up/ready to go.   Lucky customized the menu for party of 12, and she is ok with changing the menu at last minute.  She uses fresh ingredients, it was delicious and healthy Thai food.  The crew also made sure the kitchen was all clean up before they left.
1304	1	a	The owner Derrick was my artist from the beginning of my tattoo addiction, he always treated me so well, made the sessions fly by with ease and always catered to my needs. I have seen some pretty shitty tattoos on close friends and I am super thankful that I found an artist from the beginning that knows his shit. \n\nThe shop he opened is incredibly appealing, a lot more upscale then most of the hole in the walls you find in Arizona. \n\nRecently I texted him about a piece and found out he was in an accident but sent me to Mike (I believe) and told me I would love his style and he was correct. \nThe artist banged out one of my favorite tattoos really quickly and exceeded my expectations!\n\nLove this place and the staff\n-Brittany nelson
1305	1	a	Excellent bakery that also offers breakfast and lunch. All of their pastries are made in house with only the highest quality ingredients. My favorite sweet is their signature bars. They are absolutely to die for!!!!!!!!!!! Everything is just so good though. Especially their gourmet breakfast burritos and Turkey Ciabatta sandwich. Highly recommended :)
1306	1	a	I tried a lot of coffees in Montreal and this by far the best I've found ! I love going there and have a chat with Jesse while he's making my coffee. Try the Gibraltar, it's really good !
1307	0	a	"Latt\u00e9 correct. \u00c7a vient juste d'ouvrir, donc pas encore de wifi, pas encore de viennoiseries....il reste encore pas mal de trucs \u00e0 avoir et/ou r\u00e9gler, c'est artistique comme caf\u00e9......un peu \""peace&love\"".....En plus, \u00e7a fait guise de buanderie, le m\u00eame style que ''Blanc De Blanc'' sur Villeneuve. Y'a aussi une petite terrasse qui donne sur St-Denis. Bof! dans mon cas, \u00e0 vous de voir maintenant!"
1308	1	a	So glad they are near where I live here in Middleton.. I love this store. Everyone is so nice and helpful with information. ALL the employees are super knowledgeable about pet food VERY helpful! My cats thank you !\n\nThe animals I meet coming from daycare or getting groomed all seem super happy when I get my next dog I will pick this place for grooming
1309	1	a	Rudy, the man that owns this store was very nice & has been in the business for 35 years. I took a ring in to get it appraised; he was professional & knowledgable! Cleaned it up for an optimized appraisal! It's a smaller, shop run by him & his wife; which made it seem (in my opinion) very personal, attention wise. I had a wonderful experience. Will go back to get my ring sized.
1310	1	a	I just had Rudy make me a chunky gold link bracelet and he is an absolute perfectionist !\nI am as well so the fact that I am so very pleased with his work gives you an idea of the caliber work he puts out.\nI live in the midwest and will not buy another piece of jewelry from anyone else.\nI am so grateful to know I have a jeweler now who is capable of doing anything!\nThanks Rudy,\n\nSusan Hoien
1311	1	a	My recent and first-time experience with Blueberry Jewelers was for repairs on a bracelet, hoop earring, and watch.  Rudy and Norma could not have been friendlier.  The repairs were done quickly and completely at a reasonable price.  I was so impressed by Rudy's passion and commitment to his profession and eagerness to please.  He seems to truly love what he does.  He can even create a piece just for you, if you require something beyond the fine selection of jewelry in the store.  I am so pleased to have Blueberry Jewelers in my immediate neighborhood.
1312	1	a	My wife and I are from Australia and we were looking for a mother ring for her.  I saw all the good reviews on Yelp  about Rudy and Norma so we paid them a visit. We were not disappointed.  Rudy made my wife a ring over the Xmas period in a timely fashion...and before we returned home.  My wife and I are extremely happy with the  craftsmanship and quality of the ring.  THANKS Rudy !!!
1313	1	a	Located at Volcano Grille's old spot which just moved down the street on 215 & Durango\n\n[CUISINE]\nWoah. Absolutely AMAZING. I ordered quite a few things to split with the party I was with and was extremely pleased with everything we ordered.\n\nSalmon Taco: the sauce has a slight wasabi flavor. I typically don't like wasabi but this was so light and beautifully done. The fish was very fresh!\n\nChidori Bento: This free range, hormone free, dark meat chicken was incredible. The bento was complemented with a small seaweed salad, a spring salad, tempura (omg that sweet red onion), and a steamed egg. Yummy!!!\n\nChilean Sea Bass: Wow! My favorite thing so far! (I'm coming back to try that certified angus beef ribeye steak, looks freaking amazing!) This outer layer was seared to a perfect crisp. Wow. Just wow. Eat it.\n\n[DECOR]\nThis small boutique restaurant has beautiful chairs  and large wall to wall windows. They kept the hand painted murals from Volcano Grille which was a full wall of bamboo on one wall and a Japanese Caligraphy art inspired Volcano on the other wall.\n\n[SERVICE]\nThe server was very nice. The chefs took the time to greet us and talk about the food, they are all so sweet! The beautiful pastry chef also came out and described the desserts in detail, I was in such awe that I ordered everything! I was not dissapointed! I'm so full I might die though! Haha!\n\n[PRICE]\nA great deal for the quality of food. The specialties such as the filet mignon, the Chilean sea bass, and the certified Angus beef rib eye (24oz!) are all top notch quality. I'm happy they described in detail other menu items, I want to try everything here! I will be back!
1314	1	a	This cool, cozy new restaurant is insanely amazing! DEALicious meal (good quality food at reasonable price). Some of its tastiest dishes are truffle edamame, miso seabass, rock shrimp, black cod.....oh even TACO ! We tried tuna, salmon, beef and crab taco. Especially crab taco offer a dazzling mouthful the likes of which we're never tasted.....trust me; order of 4 tacos will not be enough....not to mention SCALLOPS import from Hokkaido Japan! in addition to being fresh and flavorful, they are HUGE. The food is artfully prepared and delicious. The chefs are so talented and staff are so friendly . 5 stars restaurant's quality for 3 stars restaurant's price! Definitely, this place is on the top of our list! Two thumbs up :-)
1315	1	a	New neighborhood restaurant?! We have to check it out, and we did. \n\nWhat we ordered: \n\nChawan Mushi - Not steamed in the typical cup-size, but rather a wider, slightly shallow dish. Also, their version did not have any meats or veges in the custard. Regardless of the variations, I enjoyed the creamy texture of the custard and the flavor. I did not miss the meat and veges, and liked the fine slivers of pepper garnish as the added texture and flavor. \n\nBeef Gyoza - \nI'm still undecided about this dish. I know the gyoza were made with good quality Angus beef, but I'm not sure I am ok that the beef was cooked medium-rare inside. \n\nBone Marrow - It was good and it was certainly a larger portion than expected. The salts on the side were not needed, as the top of the bones were sprinkled with enough salt. Not a huge fan of the tortilla chips that came with it and there was not enough for the two large pieces anyway. \n\nChilean Sea Bass - Always a solid bet with Chilean Sea Bass.. and was no different here. The fish was pan-fried, not overcooked and seasoned well. The jalapeno sauce sounds overwhelming but complemented the white fish, and added a freshness. It kind of reminds me of dishes they serve in the tropics. The menu tells you the oz. the fish will be, but the one we received looked larger than what was stated\n\nFried banana dessert - the fried banana with the Phllyo Dough was good, the Green Tea ice Cream was good... separately though. \n\nYes, it's true, they have large bottles of Panna for $3 - that's a steal for a restaurant. \n\nLooking forward to coming back to try other things. Maybe I'll run into LJ! Lol!
1316	1	a	I really enjoyed a nice dinner for 3 at this restaurant. We ate for under $75 for 3 people and we're satisfied. The food is good and presented well. Some items may need a touch more salt, but the overall experience will have me coming back again. I especially am hapoy that foie gras is available down the street from home when I'm craving it
1317	1	a	Yum. Amazing food, more people need to give this place business. Friendly wait staff and humble chef.
1318	1	a	Yummy in my tummy!! New cute small place. Loved that it wasn't really big. Service was good. They have a happy hour menu and alcohol will be on the menu soon!! Yay! Had several things and everything was delish! The presentation was great. The combo fried rice was so good!! Definitely recommend this place! And definitely during happy hour!!
1319	1	a	"This place is so good and legit that I have to write a review for: definitely 5+ for the amazing food and attentive service!!\nChef Kevin Chong is from Nobu which I dine in a lot due to my work. My clients from San Diego even emailed me to recommend Japaneiro after they tried it! \nI walked in with really high expectations, and Japaneiro put smiles on all of us, party of 4! Everyone is satisfied, and each dish we had is never a disappointment. \n\nTRUFFLE EDAMAME: freshly made, not the frozen ones, you can taste the truffle sauce, simple and tasty to open your taste buds.\n\nRAW OYSTERS: certainly high quality that it will be a waste if they were cooked.\n\nBONE MARROW: rich, creamy, and full of flavors, comes with chips.\n\nSEAFOOD UNDON SOUP: the chef told me that he doesn't have the special broth for undon soup tonight, but he can stir fried the undon for me! Hell I am determined and shameless to ask him to put undon in miso soup as I am craving for hot soup in this drizzling weather. The flavor is not the main concern. But the chef surprised us with this amazing undon soup with great broth and fresh assorted shrimps, sea bass, scallops and vegetables! Thumbs up to Chef Kevin's flexibility and cooking skills!\n\nDRY-AGED STEAK: even it's not Wagyu beef, but it's a wonderful piece of perfectly cooked steak. We order medium well, and it's still tender and juicy! I love the two types of sauces on the side: mustard and the truffle oil is awesome!\n\nFRIED RICE: the simplest dish is how you can see the skill of a chef. This fried rice made by teppanyaki is so tasty with beef, shrimp, chicken, and crunchy sesame. Best fried rice in town!\n\nFOIE GRAS: I love foie gras, and yes, order it. \n\nDEEP FRIED BANANA WITH GREEEN TEA ICE CREAM: the ice cream is special, not the typically biter green tea taste but fresh and with the touch of sesame, we all love it. \n\nSCALLOPS: after I \""FORCED\"" (lol) the chef to make the undon SOUP, my bestie shows him the picture she saw on line and asked the chef to make something \""Scallops\"". And what the chef presents us is the HEAVEN of scallops!!! These SWEETEST Scallops with jalape\u00f1os create a happy universe in your mouth. It's that good that after the dessert, my bestie has to order it again before we end this happy meal!!!! \n\nThis place is hidden, the menu is simple, but the food quality is to die for. The chef told us, he can make almost everything, just name it, and everything on the menu is great!\n\nAgain, I eat at Nobu a lot, and I love SOHO, but Japaneiro beats them both!!!!"
1320	1	a	Enjoyable happy hour menu - it was a great way to try everything! We will be back again, and are getting the truffle edamame and black cod lettuce wrap again for sure :)\n...so I made the cardinal mistake of posting before I finished my meal with dessert - the green tea tiramisu was amazing!  I'm a big fan of the milk tea ice cream too. Also, I was really impressed by how knowledgable our server was about the menu. She described everything perfectly. And you always have to appreciate it when the chef takes the time to come out of the kitchen to touch (greet) every table!
1321	1	a	Phenomenal experience and the executive chef is such an amazing person (he came out to share more about the food with us). We went to some great places while in Vegas -Aquaknox, Chiba Poblano, Gordon Ramsay's Burgr, Scarpetta, Caesar's Bacchanal Buffet, Eiffel Tower Restaurant- and this was the #1 meal for everyone in our party. Ambience is nice but not quite Strip-level which is totally fine. Definitely worth a trip and great quality for the price.
1322	1	a	The whole experience was excellent. It is clear why Japaneiro has four stars. They really take care of the details and Service was the best.
1323	1	a	Went for a birthday dinner.   Great quality but small portions.  Good if you like japanese /latin fusion.  Service was great.
1324	1	a	The lamb loin was out of this world. The desserts are endless combined with petit fours and truffles. Scallop rosette missed the mark but overall, splendid dining experience with top notch service.
1325	1	a	Une belle surprise. Vraiment. Bon service. J'aime beaucoup la pizza Damman. J'y retourne
1326	1	a	"Ever since Stefano Faita and Michele Forgione of Impasto announced their second project would be a pizzeria, I have been eagerly anticipating its opening. The level of craft showed from them at Impasto left me no doubts that their approach of pizza would worth the wait. Each instagram post from Chef Forgione of his test runs made me more and more excited as we saw the level of perfectionism in its purest form. This pizza would be no slouch. Finally, at long last, I could find out for myself. Pizzeria Gema opened up last month just across the street from Impasto in the heart of Little Italy making the corner of Dante and St-Dominique an happening culinary corner.\n\nGema itself is a relatively small restaurant - all of about 40 seats probably and they don't take reservations, so you may have to wait to get in. In our case, we waited about 30 minutes. The nice part is that they will take your phone number down and call you so you can go from a walk or grab a drink elsewhere in the meantime. If you prefer, there is a takeout window on the side where you order a pizza to-go or some frozen custard. The interior is sparse but clean - old wood panels on the wall, aged hardwood on the floors with a weird light \""tree\"" in the middle of the room adding some color to the space. The other focus point is the bar with its marble countertop although I got a good laugh that the bar chairs are the same Ikea ones I have in my apartment. The space isn't a looker like its neighbour Impasto but that's not an issue for me.\n\nThe menu is small and concise. A few entrees, 8 or so pizza options and some frozen custard for dessert. As a starter, we went with the fried calamari. A nice portion of fresh calamari with a good crunch to them. They are served with a couple of lemon wedges, no mayo because they don't need any sauce to enhance flavour. The calamari have plenty of flavours all by themselves.\n\nOn the pizza side, we got 2 pizzas to enjoy. The first one was their basic \""1889\"" margarita pizza with tomato sauce, fior di latte and fresh basil. The second one, because I am a huge meat-lovers fan, was the Giovanni Deluxe - tomato sauce, zampina, pepperoni, porchetta and lardo. Boy, did these pizzas not disappoint.... the pizza crust is just insane. Ridiculous. Whatever positive superlative you want to use applies to this dough. A nice crisp seer on the exterior without a single burnt spot to be seen.... and completely soft and moist inside. This level of dough mastery deserves the highest praise. Props to you Chef.\n\nAnd we haven't even gotten to the toppings yet. The classic margherita was excellent - the tomato sauce was tangy, the cheese creamy and rich, the basil brought that freshness and the overall ratio on the pizza was excellent - none of the ingredients were too present or not present enough. As for the Giovanni deluxe: house made pepperoni, the porchetta from Impasto, zampina, lardo.... this pizza had me from the description. Great combo of fatty rich meats on top of the base margherita. Simply heavenly. I just wished it had been bigger so I could enjoy it some more.\n\nWhatever you do however, make sure that you have room left for dessert because Gema has frozen custard... not ice cream but custard. The difference comes in terms of a richer, creamier texture which personally bought to mind a creamy version of Dairy Cream which hit childhood nostalgia for me every time. Gema has chocolate or vanilla so of course, we went with a twist of the two. There is also a handful of topping options - we went with crumbled baci, mixed nuts and butterscotch sauce. A perfect dessert for a pizzeria.\n\nOnce again, Chefs Faita and Forgione hit it out of the park. Gema is a wonderful addition to the pizza scene in Montreal and for me, is currently the champion hands down. That crust means business. If they offered delivery to the McGill Ghetto, I would seriously be a weekly caller. At present, I will definitely be a regular visitor because they are other topping combinations I need to try and that pizza is too good to pass up for too long. \n\nCheers!"
1327	1	a	Location: Little Italy - on Dante, east of St. Laurent. It's also right across the street from Impasto! The closest subways are Jean-Talon and de Castelnau. Street parking is available and usually easy to find if you dine early. \n\nThe place: Small and intimate, lots of wood, a cool bar. I liked the space a lot. It's more casual than Impasto.\n\nThe food: If the name hasn't given it away already, this is a pizza joint, and therefore, you go for the pizza - un point, c'est tout.  Forgione offers up a few different varieties of pizza - not too many so that you feel overwhelmed and not so few that you feel like there aren't enough choices. We started with an order of suppli that were on par with those I had in Italy. These were delicious and you could really taste the cheese, which was of a smokey variety (I forget the name). Now for the pizza: My pick was the pizza of the month - they had me at pistachio pesto and home-made mortadella. The scent of the meat wafting into my nostrils practically had me salivating before the waiter set my plate down on the table. I couldn't wait to dig in! Unlike some of the other reviews, my pizza didn't lack in toppings; the surface of the pizza was covered with mortadella, had the right amount of pesto and not too much cheese (how I like it). The crust was fresh and thin, and the overall pizza was absolutely delicious. I would definitely have this again. My date had the Bari - tomato sauce, Zampina sausage, rapini, cheese. Now, her pizza was looking a little bare and it definitely could have used more sausage. Flavor-wise, it was good but not as tasty as mine. I should mention that Gema make their own pepperoni and sausage as well as the mortadella, and it shows (or tastes, in this case).\n\nThe waiter basically hustled us into getting the frozen custard for dessert. No idea if they were other dessert options because he kept ignoring my request to see the menu. After boasting that Gema was the only place in town with frozen custard, blah blah blah, I finally just ordered the damn thing. Both my date and I shared the same thought - this tastes exactly like ice cream. So when my date pointed this out to the waiter, he replied 'well it's ice cream!' OK, so which is it? Custard or ice cream? Anyway, I don't normally order ice cream for dessert because frankly, it's ordinary and I can have that anywhere, anytime. The home-made Baci that topped the custard/ice cream/frozen thing was great. \n\nService: I'm on the fence here. We were seated quickly and were well attended to - our water was topped up regularly and the wait staff checked on us regularly. However our waiter, though very good at his job, gave off a little attitude that just occasionally rubbed us the wrong way. Not enough to dock stars, however. Overall, the service was good.\n\nPrice point: Wine, shared appy, pizza, custard/ice cream/frozen thing + macchiato ran me $37.
1328	0	a	Food was horrible I ordered a Mongolian bowel here that had noodles and meat. I didn't get to try there smoothies.
1329	0	a	TERRIBLE TERRIBLE SERVICE...AND I BLAME MANAGEMENT!  Why would you leave three teenagers without a supervisor?  They were not able to keep up with the minimal orders they had.  They had to ask us several times what we ordered.  There was no team work, they have assigned areas and they weren't willing to help when other staff members were behind.  The one girl helped a customer first who had walked in and out within less than 10mins b/c I believe she knew her...we were there for over 45mins, what's up with that?  I had to confront her just to get our orders done.  This is poor customer service so obviously some extra training in that area is necessary.  Also they were handling money and touching food with bare hands, they didn't wash hands or put on gloves.
1330	1	a	Ate here today with the hubby and this place is awesome!  Great Mexican food not spicy but they have a great spicy green salsa!  Yum the burritos are awesome and covered in green chile so yummy!  The combination plates are huge and the rice and beans are delicious will be back to post pics!  (I ate my food too fast)
1331	1	a	This place is yummy!!  Their breakfast tacos are so good. I went there for dinner tonight and got a ground beef burrito. Ready in 5 min and one of the best burritos I have ever had. A MUST TRY!!
1332	1	a	Came in today for lunch and the owner Johnny was very nice, informative about the food and the local favorite. I got a chicken quesadilla and it was the best I ever had. Very family friendly. Will definitely be back.
1333	1	a	Johnny the owner, manager, cook, cashier and greeter is AWESOME! My husband and I ordered the breakfast burritos and they were excellent. The burritos has a homemade aroma to it! We loved it! We also love the salsa and pico de gallo, there are many various type of salsa and you can have as much as you like! In addition to our visit, Johnny gave us four free burritos to take home! He is one of sweetest owner I have met. It is oblivious that he cares for his customers. Awesome food, awesome owner, awesome place! Very clean too. I highly recommend and I will be coming back myself.
1334	1	a	Tried this place purely by Yelp Reviews and location. \n\nWanted something different for breakfast so wanted to try the chorizo breakfast burrito for $3.00.\n\nWhen I went to pick up the burrito,  they had a selection of home made salsas so I tried a few and when I got home to open the bag the owner placed 2 burritos in the bag.\n\nWas a great surprise! \n\nThe burrito was of normal size and not of one of the xxxbertos or chipotle. Pretty good mix of eggs chorizo and potatoes. \n\nNot a fancy place but good food at a inexpensive price.\n\nWill co.e back to try other items.
1335	1	a	I have been coming here at least two times every week now and Johnny has NEVER disappoint me. The food is always so good, fresh, fast and affordable. This is a must try place! :)
1336	0	a	J'ai opt\u00e9 pour le classique... Patates, sauce, grains de fromage! J'ai pas aim\u00e9 la sauce qui est plut\u00f4t sucr\u00e9e ... Les frites \u00e9taient dure et non croustillantes. Bonne quantit\u00e9 de fromage. Service courtois endroit propre,\nC'est probablement une question de go\u00fbt mais la Poutine de plan\u00e8te Poutine  n'est pas au Mien... Triste moi qui mange une Poutine par ann\u00e9e! J'avais envie de me r\u00e9galer....
1337	1	a	La place est bien. Le service est un peu lent et du Whitney Houston en ambiance est diff\u00e9rent comme choix de musique...\n\nPour le positif, la poutine G\u00e9n\u00e9ral Tao est excellente et tr\u00e8s g\u00e9n\u00e9reuse. La poutine r\u00e9guli\u00e8re est bonne aussi mais un peu sucr\u00e9e.
1338	0	a	"I have had my car serviced several times by them. At first they were great but it was only putting on a new set of tires. Then I chose them to do an oil change, which the first time was fine but 3 hour wait. The next oil change they did what they call their check of fluids, tire pressure, oil change, battery check, and tire rotation. Two complaints here, one when I left tire pressure light was on so I pulled over at gas station and yes all 4 tires were 20 psi UNDER so I added air and then noticed the oil change sticker, said next oil change was due at 68,000 miles which is just poor math on technician part since car was currently at 72,000 miles. The sticker should have said 78,000 miles. I went back again and this is where the mistakes become larger.\n\nI took car in for oil change again and they did all their checks, tire rotations and such again...I told them please make sure to check fluid as light is on. I was told that they check for leaks and all fluids with every oil change. When I left the fluid low light was still on, I thought I just needed to drive for a bit to let cars computer catch up. Well every time I started car for the next 3 days the low fluid light still came on. I opened up the overflow tank for anti-freeze and WOW to my surprise it was not just low it was EMPTY. I called them and was told I needed to add water and drive right over as I probably have a leak. Hmm odd since they told me just days prior that I had no leaks and everything was great on my car. I drove it down and they did another leak check came back and told me NO LEAKS it's just low. REALLY???? They added anti-freeze for a nice $56 bill and they had no explanation of why I had no fluid in my car when they just told me 3 days prior that they checked all fluids and everything was fine.\n\nIf they had simply said oops must have forgotten to add fluid we are sorry I would have been fine with that. But to charge me $56 because of their negligence. Risking my car over heating is not okay, refusing to admit fault, over charging me for a service they call \""complimentary\"""
1339	0	a	This may have to be the worst managed repair shop I've even experienced.  Brought my car in for some AC repairs.  They unleashed a self-admitted under performing repair tech ( whom the subsequently fired) on my evaporator.  I go on to pick up my car and find my personal belongings, and a bunch or extra screws and fasteners literally thrown all around the vehicle.  Had to bring it back three times to correct reassembly mistakes, each time the mangers tells me the squeaks and rattles aren't their fault..even thou I give him a handful of saws and fasteners that I found on the floor.   They took my money, did a lousy job and refused to make it right. Run far and fast!
1340	1	a	"No one likes to visit car care places... who likes the generally unexpected costs of being an adult?  And car maintenance costs are like movie theater concession prices - THAT much money for THAT?!?!  \n\nI have been to this Goodyear a few times, I live less than 2 miles from here.  The service has always been friendly. As a female, it's always a concern that I am being taken advantage of because I am not knowledgeable of those things vehicular, but I have not really felt like I have been up-sold or offered things that I didn't necessarily need.  They have patched some tires for me (put the spare on for me a couple of times until I could afford a new tire - I will be doing a review of my apartment complex and how their new roof and siding project has ruined 4 tires in less than 7 months), new battery, oil changes and some other miscellaneous fixes.  This service center is located next to some restaurants if you are going to be there for a while, or directly across from Stonecrest if you are going to be there for a long while.  \n\nToday's visit was another freakin' screw in my tire, which couldn't be repaired because of the location of the screw in the tire (I was expecting that it wouldn't  be a repair, but a replacement), but once I explained it was two days before Christmas and I don't  have the scratch for a new tire, they put the spare on to get me around until payday.  I was there for about 30 minutes (maybe less, I was watching HGTV on the flat screen they have in the waiting area) and the cost for putting my spare on was $10.  \n\nThe waiting area is clean, with a TV and magazines.  The chairs are as comfortable as you can expect for a waiting area, which is nice.  \n\nAnother plus of this location is weekend hours.  I can't always take off of work for repairs, so it's nice to have 2 weekend days to take care of life's little \""DAMMIT\"" moments."
1341	0	a	DO NOT BUY ANYTHING FROM HERE! They are absolute crooks and will lie to you and overcharge you. While discussing the prices of some new tires, I laid my NEW phone down on the desk and they had the audacity to steal it then deny it. The employees are thieves, do not shop here. Unless you want your personal belongings stolen, avoid this store. Do not trust these employees with your car, take your business elsewhere
1342	1	a	"Conveniently located.  I've always found the guys to be super friendly and professional.\n\nRecently had a flat spot on tire.  No discernible event or damage.  They went to bat for me with goodyear, got a pretty substantial credit.\n\nCould have easily tagged me for another new (second) tire but didn't.  They even called dealer, made inquiry re wear parameters and said, \""you don't need it.\""\n\nSimilarly, had them change out pads and rotors on back.  They were honest and said, \""you still have about 25% left on front,\"" so again didn't take advantage of situation.\n\nDropped car off later in pm Saturday and they called first thing Sunday, done!\n\nGood job y'all."
1343	1	a	I've been to the lanuch buffet twice since this restaurant opened a few weeks ago and am quite impressed. It's a small space so their buffet is fairly limited, but everything on it is of very high quality - significantly better than any other Indian place in Oakland. Highlights include perfectly fluffy naan, moist and flavorful tandoori chicken, and a very bold chicken tikka masala. Owners/staff are very friendly. My one complaint is that they don't warm the food very well, and some of the items get cold during slow periods. Still, for $7 you can't find a better lanuch.
1344	1	a	My girlfriend and I had been planning on going to an Indian restaurant nearby this establishment, though after finding out it was closed we walked a short distance and decided to try this place. It was just opening up for dinner, so the service getting the food was a little slow, though all other aspects of the service was immaculate. The food was delicious and the atmosphere was terrific. The prices for some menu items were a little high, though well worth it (in my opinion).  If you're in the mood for Indian food I suggest this place highly.
1345	1	a	Chicken Korma Curry -\nAMAZING flavor!  Stopped in for a quick lunch and had Korma Curry on our mind.  The buffet looked wonderful - seven days a week til 4:00 for $7.99 - will try next time!
1346	0	a	I used to love this place, the guy who ran it was cool, honest and helpful. After today's initial experience with this new counter guy, I was hesitant to leave my car, but will likely not be back....\n\nThe service ended up being okay, but like I said, whatever it was about the new front desk guy, I felt like I was being talked down to and like I was on the verge of being shammed. The place used to be open on Sunday's, due to staffing at the moment they are not, so don't even try to book an appointment on line for Sunday, they will redirect you.\n\nI think I am going to find a new place to do oil changes and car tune ups...sad, I used to love going here.
1347	0	a	Expect to wait for hours. They are very thorough which is awesome but you will spend all day there for just an oil change. Free wifi though. The guy at the counter also wasn't very friendly.
1348	0	a	I ordered 2 tires on Monday, October 15th and was told that they would be coming from Victorville, CA (approximately 350 miles) and would be in around Thursday, October 18th. Come Thursday, I don't hear anything - I call them on Friday morning at 9:00 AM and the individual at the front desk tells me he'll check on the order and will call me right back. I finally get tired of waiting and call back at around 11:30 AM, only to be told that the order never got shipped and I was looking at Wednesday, Oct 24th. I needed the tires for a car show which I wasn't able to attend. Also, during this entire process, Pat didn't call me back one time - I had to keep calling. I can see once but this business acts like it doesn't want business. If I had any other way of getting these tires, I would not use this business. I will edit this review once the tires come in and they mount/balance them - I have a bad feeling about having to deal with these people...\n\n*Edit* The tires came in yesterday, October 24th at around 2:45 PM. I asked what time they closed because I needed the tires mounted/balanced ASAP. Although they closed at 7 PM, they would not get to them until the next day. I told them that this was unacceptable and that I needed the tires mounted and balanced that day - since they were already a week late due to their order screw-up. So I ended up taking the tires/wheels to Discount tire on Bell Road and had them mount/balance in under 1 hour. Then I was able to spend the rest of the evening prepping/dipping the wheels.\n\nMoral of the story:  I will NEVER go to Goodyear Auto Service Center again. Everything; from their failure to followup on my order or follow through and contact customers; to not making concessions to mount/balance my tires that day (I would try and make things as right as possible if I were a business); to me listening to the guy at the counter try and con an old lady into getting a 3-pack of alignments for $75.00 - it all adds up to me rating them at about 1.2 stars - I'll round down.
1349	0	a	Same report as others. Grumpy desk manager and they tried to sell me unnecessary services. The store manager needs some customer service lessons. Go to Big O tire down the road near Grand!!!
1350	1	a	Lot to choose from and for this person likeable flavors new to the pallet. Zatar/cheese on flatbread.\ncheese/fresh spinach on flatbread Soujok which is beef, garlic, chili peper and spices on flatbread with a true gift for your sensory perseption. I enjoyed Kenafa Nubalsi desert at two other restaurants. This place to me was SUPERIOR Kenafa  Also had nice tea with mint and pleasant bottle nixed fruit drink. Would kile to try everything but blindfold suggested in area of pastry case. Fortunately I put all my weight on in my ears!
1351	0	a	Stopped for a quick lunch yesterday and both husband and I thought it wasn't all that great.\n\nWe both got a burrito with guacamole and pico de gallo. I've had better meat before. It didn't even taste like asada and it was definitely way too salty. I was thirsty for hours.\n\nThere's a salsa bar (we tried a red salsa and a green one. Green one was OK. The red one tasted too much like tomato sauce. Nothing special) but you get no chips with your burrito, you have to pay extra for them.\n\nIt was our first time there and most likely we won't go back. There are better Mexican restaurants in town.
1352	0	a	With the hundreds of Mexican food options in the Valley of the sun, choose any except this one. A breakfast burrito cost me $6.49....nearly twice the cost of any other place. A friend ordered a sausage breakfast burrito...he ended up with hot dogs as sausage. Take it from someone who has had years of burrito experience, dont bother coming here.
1353	0	a	Now, I can't speak for the other clinics, but this place is terrible. First off, the quality of service is mediocre. They also force you to always see the same dentist and hygienist, so they can never schedule an appointment in a reasonable amount of time or when you need it, think 3 month waiting period, like you have some lasting relationship with someone you've only seen for 5 min once every 6 mos. \n\nI dread my dentist appointment because it means I'll have to move my whole schedule around to accommodate it and if something comes up, I have to wait weeks (at least) to get another appointment.\n\nThe only reason I go is because GHC forces you to use them for dental coverage, I think I'm going to drop GHC just because I hate going here for dental.
1354	0	a	Wow, so I did not end up going to this office because the phone service was terrible.  They were so rude and no helpful at all.\n\nThe receptionist barked at me about my lack of availability for appointment time.  They left me on hold for nearly twenty minutes.  \n\nI can not attest for anything else, but the receptionist has a terrible attitude.
1355	0	a	Dentist:\nService is very mediocre, you feel as though there is an assembly line and you are just a product that needs to get to the other end.\nThe staff are not pleasant, again pretty much In a rush to get you out the door and the insurance to pay.\nIf you need an appointment you'll have to wait for months ... Really ridiculous all around.  \n\nOrthodontist:\nOne of my kids needed orthodontic work (my third kid treated here) yet their prices are higher than most the other clinics, the orthodontist actually said to me they price their cost with benevolence as if to imply they are doing you a favor to get paid over $6k for a total of leas than 10 hours of work \n\nI'm glad we changed dentists and orthodontists, we put up with them for far too long; I recommend you seek other options if you can.
1356	0	a	"I would never trust them for more than cleaning my teeth! You walk in to get a service and you are told it costs $, you go home and then you get a $$$ bill. Very unprofessional staff and dentists. It is more of a business place rather than a \""care providing\"" clinic. If you want to go there, count your teeth before and after!"
1357	0	a	Disgusted I even have to choose a star. Horrible service. And the worker named roman is very unprofessional. He ignored me the first few minutes I was in there and then proceeded to make sexual comments towards me even after I told him I had a boyfriend. I was so disturbed by his behavior I had to run out of there without purchasing anything. DO NOT GO HERE!
1358	0	a	Clean shop, did fine for what I had done but I can't justify spending $30 for just a taper and lining. This place needs to get their pricing broken down better, astronomical prices for mediocre work. Also, no military discount... I doubt I'll give these guys a second chance.
1359	0	a	THE WORST Company EVER~! Cancel my phone & internet in Feb 2011, they kept billing me until July. I called twice every month telling them I have cancel and to stop taking $ from my bank account. They tell me, my canceling order is pending & frozen in their system with an error. So FIX IT. They can't fix it & spend me to every damn department to get it fix. Still not fix & it's Sept. Trying to get my refund is a joke. No one knows what's going on in my case. I tell them there should be LOTS of notes on my acct. They just keep transferring me to other departments. Or tell me to hold & get disconnected. Please wait about a month. Everything should be fix by then. Well it's SEPT and NOTHING IS FIX YET. I still didn't get my refund of $354.69 This company is ridiculous. \n\nUpdate: Sept 29 Call back today and still no refund. Still can't fix the problem & give me, my refund. Now they have another BS to give me. I think I heard it all from them =T \n\nUPDATE: 10/25/11 Call today 1st agent didn't know what he was talking about give me mad BS & didn't even ask for my name or acct #. Transferred me to another department. They said to wait 90 days. I told them I been waiting since FEB to now. SO she transferred me to another department. All that agent can say is that is our policy you just have to wait there isn't anything we can do about it. Are you serious this is so beyond RIDICULOUS~! \n\nUpdate: 11/4 still waiting for my check. =T \n\nUpdate finally got a check in Jan 2012, Waited almost a full year to get my refund and no interest no apology from them nothing.
1360	0	a	Cheaper than cox and for obvious reasons!!!! Century link is horrible, first off I waited almost 2 weeks for them to come out and hook up my service. The technician that came out was actually super nice, knew what he was doing, great customer service. I signed up for  cable, phone, and internet with them. besides the face that my bill changed each month,  and I noticed I was getting charged for using *69 (which I had added the *69 feature) and when I called to inquire about that and why my bill was dramatically different. The rep I spoke with told me that I did in fact have the feature however I never called to activate it so I had been charged each time I had used it, and then she gave me several reasons to why my billing was always another amount each month. I then requested for them to cancel my service and pick up their equipment  and I called cox and had them connect my services again yet I continued to get bills from century link, each time I called ( about 4 times total) to have them cancel my service they said ok and someone would pick up the equipment, 5 months later I am now getting calls and letters from collections and I still have the equipment sitting in my apartment waiting to be picked up. I even told them I work in the office where I live so they can call me or stop by the office to pick it up if I am not home. This company is a joke cox may not be the best company but century link is the WORST!!!!
1361	0	a	BEWARE!!  Even if you get a decent monthly rate when you sign up, they will add various fees.  When I called I specifically told them that I only needed a few months of service.  They quoted me a rate, then when I received my first bill there was a connection fee (around $25 I believe), then after I cancelled my service after the two months I needed, they charged me a CANCELLATION fee as well!!
1362	0	a	I contacted them via email about the hidden charges.  They refunded the disconnect fee.
1363	0	a	they say if you type something in capitals you are either yelling or emphasizing.  in my situation it is both!!  so hear me loudly...***the worst service ever!***  i can sit here and write this long list of things that they've done wrong.  but for anyone to take the time out to write these things is just enough said! escalation is a joke.  all it means is we have a lot of other clients more important than you!  even though we know that you are at our mercy, that doesn't matter what matters is that we are going to make the calling center so difficult that you will just have to call in 3-4 times after being transferred all over the usa to the wrong departments! and there is nothing you can say or do but wait! *********wow*********
1364	0	a	"Century Link is consistently unreliable and uncooperative.  Their \""customer service\"" people seem to work off of scripts, and they don't care about, or even understand, personal service.  Every time I have contacted them about a problem, they have been consistently uncooperative.  If you are finally able to deal with an actual technician, the technicians themselves are usually pretty decent and try to be helpful, but the customer service people are horrendous and utterly frustrating to deal with.  I would advise anyone to stay away from this company."
1365	0	a	So frustrating. Consistently one of if not THE worst customer service lines I've had the displeasure of dealing with. It takes forever to speak to someone and that's after waiting and being transferred around to the right department. Somehow I always get sent by a rep to some random voicemail. Our phone line and internet service go down whenever it rains in Vegas. It never fails. I can always count on our phone and internet not working whenever there's a thunderstorm.  I can also always count on them to take their time  sending a tech the next day to our house if at all. Absolutely the worst phone/internet service I've ever had. Total garbage. I'm done with this company.
1366	0	a	"My bill goes to CenturyLink in Phoenix, but that's likely just a billing center, so I'll write my experience here.\n\nI switched to CenturyLink for only home internet at the urging of a DirecTV customer service agent when I called into them to cancel/save on my bill. I was offered a \""bundle\"" discount through DirecTV for using CenturyLink for my home internet. I previously had Cox internet and was fine with the price, the service, etc. I switched because it was going to save me around $15 on my DirecTV bill and was about the same price as my internet with Cox was ($39/month).\n\nOur home internet was installed/connected by a tech on Sept 16, and she was professional. Unfortunately that's when we were told that our perfectly good, nearly new Zoom router was not \""compatible\"" with CenturyLink's DSL. I was never told that on the phone. She informs us that they can either charge us about a $6/month router rental fee or we can buy it for about $100. OK, whatever.\n\nInternet is working, seems about as fast as they said it would be (10 MB/s downlad speed). HOWEVER, when I get my first bill it was not the approximate $150 I expected ($45 for Oct-Nov pre-billed, about $35 or so for the partial month of service in Sept, the $60 installation fee DirecTV  informed us of, and any applicable taxes). NOPE, it was for $184.48. They charged us MORE for the partial month of service (Sept 16-Oct 8) than for the full month of service! \n\nI called into them to inquire, waited 12 minutes and after about 2 minutes of actual discussion with a customer service rep the call was abruptly disconnected. I was sitting still in my house, with full signal on my phone. WTH? I call back, wait on the phone again for about 10 minutes, and I get another rep so I have to start my story all over. She is in the midst of going through the charges (rather ineffectively) and explaining why it was so much (she confirmd that yes, they don't \""discount\"" partial months when they prorate them, which is why my first 23 days of service actually cost MORE than the full 30 day month did...how does that make any sense?!) The call disconnects again!!! Note that once again, I have full signal, full battery and was completely stationary during the call.\n\nI immediately call DirecTV, get someone after only about 3 minutes of waiitng and surprise, surprise: I talk to him for about 10 minutes with NO issues of the call dropping. Clearly it was CenturyLink's phones that disconnected. Luckily, the agent at DirecTV was at least sympathetic to my concerns and troubles with the two dropped phone calls, so he said he'd put in a request for them to look at my inquiry and call me back in the next few days. Nothing so far and it's been one week.\n\nI have worked out to the penny what I think my bill should be ($151.25) and once I do get ahold of someone at CenturyLink, I intend for them to adjust this or I'll be opening a complaint with the BBB and likely cancelling my DirecTV simply because they talked me into switching to CenturyLink.\n\nI'll keep you all posted on things...wish me luck!"
1367	1	a	This place is amazing! Not only they provide update Chinese (Cantonese/Mandarin) songs, but also English songs.  The decorations are pretty and colorful. The rooms are nice and clean. The drinks are really good and I enjoyed the food. \n\nMy favorites would be the chicken wings, gyoza, curry fish balls and the duck wings! \nThis place is good for parties and celebration. Highly recommended their mocktails. \n\nThis is going to be my new hangout place that can have great food and karaoke at the same time!
1368	0	a	Pizza a Metro recently opened up (used to be Via's pizza). My brother had told me he went for a pizza (pie) there to try it out. They have a woodstove that they cook their pizzas in. He was very impressed. So.. I took a chance and brought my daughter along.  The restaurant is really lovely inside and has linen table cloths and napkins. The staff are very nice and very attentive. Of course there was only one other couple there at the time. So not sure how they would measure up to a full house.\nMy daughter ordered her usual.. lasagna and I ordered a pizza. Now I will say this.. their sauce on the lasagna was in one word.. A-M-A-Z-I-N-G!!!!! \nHowever their need to tighten up their technique when it comes to both dishes. The pasta was WAY OVER COOKED. And the pizza was not cooked completely.  When you pick up a piece of pie and it hangs down to the floor... there is a problem there. I ended up taking the outer crust and dipping it into the sauce... because again.. it was AMAZING! If they can perfect their cooking methods.. I will be back, but not until then.
1369	1	a	Very tasty wood fired pizza. Pasta pomodoro was good but not great. My son very much enjoyed his calzone. Service was very attentive which brings this review up from a three and a half to a four. The feel was an odd mix of fine dining and casual with white tablecloths and kids running in and out from the patio to the dining room. \nWe would probably return for the pizza.
1370	0	a	I really wanted to like this place since it is so close to my house, but alas, it shall not be. Ok so the ambiance and service were fine. Why only one star? Because I think that the bare minimum that a pizza place should provide is edible pizza. The pizza was simply horrible. To echo the comments of several others, they don't seem to know how to work the oven. The crust was almost raw and the whole pizza was barely warm. I was treating several relatives and was totally embarrassed about the whole thing. Hopefully, they figure out how to run the oven and can turn it around.
1371	1	a	The food was yummy! We ordered a caprese  salad, which was super fresh! And a pepperoni mushroom pizza, it was thin and crispy! The service was great, waiter was attentive and the restaurant is super clean and has a great ambiance. We will definitely be coming again!
1372	0	a	"Nothing to write home about, don't even know why I am writing this review.  I wanted woodfire pizza, and unfortunately, there are few in the East valley.  The pizza could have been good if the crust was crispier and less chewy, even my dog had a hard time chewing it.  Also, I ordered a specialty drink \""cherry martini\""  Let's not get crazy folks!! This was marischino (sp) cherries with the juice, and vodka, tasted like a bad air freshener.  Also, the antipasto plate looked like everything was from a can, mushrooms, olives, eggplant, the only thing I liked was the mozzarella, but I had to ask for olive oil and balsamic, and some little bread points they had because without those fillers it would have been bland and I would have left hungry.  The ants and crickets jumping at my feet and biting my toes while on the patio had more personality than the server.\n\nThat's all!  I shouldn't go into an Italian restaurant and have to critique the whole menu.  How can pizza go wrong?"
1373	0	a	Nice place...they had someone playing a guitar that couldn't sing.. so that was interesting. ..let's start with the food...I had spaghetti. .it was very watery and no flavor until I added salt...my dish was served with no bread. .didn't seem right...The service. .I don't have any restaurant experience but I could tell the staff is disorganized and running into each or over each other..I don't recommend this place or would I come back and I live 2 blocks away...
1374	0	a	If they spent as much attention to their food as their atmosphere this place would be good, but it's not. They might have just served us MREs now that I think about it...
1375	0	a	The wait for service and food was excruciatingly long.  When the wood fired pizza arrived (pizza kid was working as fast as he could in his defense) the crust was severely undercooked, bordering on raw dough.  \n\nManager was very nice and apologetic about the long wait for food, and gave us a free desert.  We passed on the dessert, as two hours was far too long to be there.  The manager in turn gave us a free dessert coupon.  Nice staff trying to make this a nice place.\n\nKitchen staff needs some training.  I will be a VERY long time before I try this place again.
1376	1	a	9/10/14  7:30 PM\n\nSame great tasting food, different location.  It's 5 minutes from our house.  My boyfriend's mom told us about this gem 3 years ago.  We've fallen in love with the experience & the food.  Very happy to find a place that we can ALL eat healthy without having an allergic reaction.\n\nI personally like to get the Bento boxes (starting $9) add chicken, steak, fried rice & grilled veggies. Their fried rice is the closest thing I'm used to for REALLY good fried rice.  It's similar to what we're used to on the East Coast. Their sweet garlic sauce is awesome,  but I enjoy the food just how it is.  They have plenty sauces to sample, I usually put a tiny bit in the cup & go up again if I like it. Sweet garlic is my favorite. \n\nThe portions are right, priced reasonably & served fresh. Can't wait to go back again. Now we live closer too. I wish these guys the best of luck with their new location. It's a beautiful new atmosphere & centrally located. They deserve it.
1377	0	a	I ordered a vento box that everyone was so crazy about  and that was the most horrible food ever tasted  i even spend a day at  my hotelroom  since i got food poison for all of you out there make worth your money for the price i paid i would have gone to eat at panda express at least i know that they are not pretended  to call themselves something they are not  like volcano advertise false statements like  they say they sell teppanyaki food these people  need urgently take some classes before call themselves teppenyaki chefs they do not know that is that at all
1378	1	a	Fantastic people who care about great food and health. I love this place, and the sauce bar. Chicken Bowls for life!
1379	1	a	My boyfriend took me here one day, because it's his favorite lunch place. I can see why he likes it so much. All the food is really and tastes healthy. Healthy AND good. I usually get the bento box either with steak, chicken, or salmon. The portions are huge so make sure you don't overorder. They even have this little sauce bar type area so you can make your own sauces for your food.

1381	0	a	"Originally I wasn't going to even bother writing about my experience at Brutus, however a friend of mine posted his disdain with the restaurant on their Facebook and was met with ridicule. So here's is my very unhappy review of my experience at this establishment. \n\nMy boyfriend and I showed up a bit ahead of our group; we were to be six in total. The hostess told us a table would be available in twenty minutes. 15 minutes later a waiter came to get us to bring us to the back of the restaurant to a great booth that would have been perfect because unlike the noisy restaurant the back was secluded and quiet. We sat down after a little confusing from patrons already seated in the back (they had to move over to the smaller booth cause they were only three) we ordered drinks and waited; our friends showed up and were ready to order drinks when we were told we needed to move to another table to set a bigger group in the back, they proceeded to squish us into a both that clearly didn't fit six . We ordered drinks again and proceeded to look at the menu; which was mediocre at best the grilled cheese is pre-made and they didn't have any pizza pockets left, only the veggie option. Why does a bacon restaurant offer veggie options. Odd. But ok. We asked for bacon on the side, which we never got and we ordered the ten dollar bacon bowl which is so deceiving cause you don't see it, it's covered by the bowl (not how is was Advertised in the paper) the waiter gave up on us, clearly not caring if we liked our food or needed more drinks. Seeing as our drinks sat on the bar for about 15 minutes. Once the waiter delivered out drinks he spilt one drink on our friend and didn't apologize and was more concerned with cleaning up the floor. Overall really not impressed. \n\nWhat made me actually write this review was after my friend posted on Facebook the person In charge of the Facebook page posted a link of justin Bieber's song baby. My friend replied asking if they were trying to insult him and they replied with a \""what it's a good song\"" \n\nReally not impressed with this restaurant. Don't even bother going here it's definitely over hyped and not worth it"
1382	0	a	so now, they are showing hockey games on hockey nights.. its not like we are lacking in places to see games around town..
1383	0	a	Brutus bar ...ils ont malheureusement, \u00e0 mon avis, cr\u00e9\u00e9 trop d'attentes avec leur concept bacon. Le menu est ordinaire, la bouffe correct, les drinks OK. Les serveurs semblent un peu immature et ne sont pas trop attentionn\u00e9s. Impossible de faire des changements sur le menu (dans le genre d'avoir un \u00e0-c\u00f4t\u00e9 salade au lieu des frites !!). La moiti\u00e9 du menu n'a pas de bacon et impossible de demander du bacon \u00e0 grignoter avant minuit (lorsque la cuisine ferme), car sinon ils manquent de bacon avant m\u00eame que la nuit arrive...belle ironie. Leur dessert de beigne au bacon est cependant une r\u00e9ussite (quoique tr\u00e8s cochon). Aussi, vu la nouveaut\u00e9 du bar dont l'ouverture \u00e9tait attendue, l'ambiance est au rendez-vous. \nJe m'attendais \u00e0 plus que ce que j'ai eu. Aller prendre un verre OK...aller manger boff.
1384	1	a	Awesome ambience. Awesome food. Definitely want to go back because literally every food item is a must-try.
1385	1	a	Have been 2 times since they opened, the place is delicious.  Eggs benedict was perfect, hash browns are still hands down the best in town, fresh squeezed orange juice was like liquid gold, coffee is Lavazza - good stuff, not the watery junk most places have.  I had to ask the guy next to me what he was eating... chorizo maple french toast, CAN'T WAIT to go back & try that, looked so so good.  They also have chocolate covered bacon.  SO excited about this place
1386	1	a	All I can say is wow! Great place. Service is incredible. Food is incredible. They're super accommodating. If I could give six stars I would.\n\nThe omelette I had was amazing. They somehow get them fluffy and not too heavy. Highly recommend. I chose roasted garlic, toasted almonds, and grilled asparagus. The balsamic reduction on top was delicious.\n\nHash browns are homemade and top notch.\n\nMy wife got the Melt Away and it was equally delicious. The veggies were really good.\n\nOrange juice is fresh squeezed and tastes like heaven.\n\nI cannot recommend enough.
1387	1	a	Just found a great new breakfast spot in Scottsdale that just opened recently-Eggstacy.  Great menu, excellent food - I had the breakfast burrito with fruit; the best I've ever had.  Amazing service from Britni and Chris.  This place is a homerun.  Goodbye Butterfield's
1388	1	a	I tried this wonderful new breakfast and lunch spot in Scottsdale for the first time and thoroughly enjoyed it.  The menu is excellent and the food preparation and presentation was superb.  I had a terrific breakfast burrito with fruit which was fresh and served with a generous helping of sliced avacado.  Every plate I noticed being served looked exquisite.  My servers, Britni and Chris were also wonderful which just made the experience all that more enjoyable.  Also, unlike many other breakfast spots Eggstasy does accept reservations.  If you're a Scottsdale breakfast person you'll be pleased you gave Eggstasy a try.
1389	1	a	This is our second visit to Eggstasy and it's just getting better. Peter Varros, the owner, is always out and about, checking on customers and spreading serious joy. He is great and obviously knows what he's doing. \n\nHad the panini today...and the wheat pancakes....and corned beef hash with hash browns....and a fruit crepe...geez. All so very fresh and good. I'm stuffed. The portions are really huge and probably should be cut down by a third. \n\nHad the orange juice today and it was truly fresh-squeezed and almost mango-colored. They must be using the good Valencia oranges. Yum. Hard to find fresh-squeezed anything in the Valley. \n\nOur waitress, Tara, was professional, warm and attentive without being overly so. Nice staff. \n\nThis place is starting out very well. Lovely location, nice natural light from the windows (we always get there early enough to get a window seat!), noisy, but in a happy way. \n\nHopefully, it will be here for a very long time. God knows, the Valley needs a decent breakfast place....this is our new choice. Next time, it's lunch!
1390	1	a	This place is great! Gave up Good Egg for this morning spot! Peter is awesome already knows our orders and you can see they really want their customers to be happy! Big shout out to Iliya he is a good employee there.
1391	1	a	This place is definitely  as good as all the reviews say! Some of the best food you'll ever taste .....and huge portions! The coffee is amazing ...! Keep up the good work !!!!!
1392	1	a	We rarely go out to breakfast but I love to do so and the menu caused my husband to remark that we'll have to come back because there are so many things he wants to try! Yay!\n\nI had an omelet (yummy) which I easily shared with my two kids: ages 2 and 4, and still had some leftover. I appreciated that our server suggested sharing, as opposed to swindling us into kids meals instead (though well have to get the Mickey pancakes next time just because they looked fun and yummy). My husband had the salmon eggs Benedict and he said it was fantastic. The orange juice was generous and fresh squeezed and omg the hashbrowns?? Even if the rest of the food was horrible I'd be coming back for the hashbrowns. Best I've ever had, ever. My potato hating husband even devoured them. \nThe owner, or person I assumed was the owner, was very present. He was helpful working with his staff by clearing plates and also making the rounds to check in with guests. Super nice guy!\n\nKid friendly, delicious, great vibe, we'll be back!
1393	0	a	Service was fine but the worst corn beef hash I have ever had. Really ruined the whole meal. The server was polite but didn't seem to know what to do. There are so many better options around here.
1394	1	a	Came to Eggstasy for breakfast with my husband. The four stars are primarily for the service. Our waitress was friendly and accommodating. Because we came in on a Monday morning, the restaurant was not super busy. \n\nI ordered the basic eggs Benedict and my husband had the corned beef hash. The Benedict and hash browns were just okay. Nothing special with the flavor. My husband liked the way the corned beef hash was prepared (not undercooked and with a little crispness).  \n\nWe also ordered a mimosa and Bloody Mary drinks. The first Bloody Mary drink needed to be redone. There was not enough spice or tomato flavor. The Bloody Mary comes with a chocolate covered piece of bacon. That was okay (maybe too much chocolate coating).\n\nThere are a lot of choices on the menu and because this place is new, I believe they are still finding their signature flavor. I'd be willing to give it another try.
1395	0	a	I was so happy we chose to go here at first. Eggstacy offered a wonderful brunch, full menu with lots of exciting choices, and friendly service. We sat at the bar where there was only one bar tender - apparently the other left sick - and for the most part the service was very accommodating. I got an omlette that was massive, and they give you the choice between toast or pancakes. The sourdough toast I ordered was paired with fresh whipped butter and an individual sized jar of jam. If you order pancakes as your side, be prepared for a full, two-cake plate with whipped cream.\n\n  The wait was not bad at all at first - maybe 15, 20 minutes. The more we have visited, the worse the wait times have become. Expect to wait 40 minutes for your food to arrive, and then watch the waiters ask every table on the way if the order is theres or not. The staff is so poorly trained and managed that its almost comical. The only other downside is a question of the general cleanliness of the restaurant and an odd restroom set up. The bang-for-your-buck factor, along with the quality of food, is great. Just not sure of its worth the circus that ensues.
1396	1	a	Wow!! That food was incredible! With every sandwich not only do you get your choice of fries or fruit but you also get soup with it and it was great!\n\nAtmosphere is good, they have a great patio that's large and perfect to sit outside when our weather isn't so hot. Service was very slow but food made it worth it. Deff going back!
1397	0	a	We went on Sunday and it took over an hour from the moment we ordered to get our food. Our waiter was horrible and the manager did not do anything to make up for the slow service and long wait. People were walking out because the food was taking too long. We ended up getting our food to go because we had lost our appetite. Although the food was good we will never come back. No concept of hospitality/customer service.
1398	0	a	"Went on a recommendation from a friend, who said it was good.  He was dead wrong.  I have three words for the owner.  Simplify your menu!  It's like they are trying to be 7 restaurants wrapped into one.  Why 1 star?  Well, the food took almost 45 minutes.  I can deal with a long wait if the staff is still attentive, apologetic in some fashion and most importantly that when my food comes it is hot and prepared properly.  I'm guessing that trying to accommodate what looks to be over 100 menu items out of that kitchen would be the cause for the long wait.  Next reason for the 1 star, when my food did come it tasted like it was all mixed together and undercooked.  Tried a benedict and the egg was barely poached, like runny snot water looking eggs.  The hollandaise was broken and never should have been served.  Tried the \""homemade\"" has browns and they tasted like a greasy burger?  Not sure if they are cooked on the same cooking surface or if the cooks don't change gloves. The restaurant was pretty busy, but what breakfast place isn't on the weekends.  Butterfields, Pancake House, Breakfast Club, Scramble and Snooze all make this place look like it's held together with shoe laces.  Sorry, but won't be back."
1399	1	a	We tried this place yesterday for breakfast & everything was delicious. Service was excellent. We got a chance to sit outside since the weather was fab. We would say this place is the best new breakfast spot in Scottsdale. We will be back.
1400	0	a	We came here today for the first time. The reviews looked great and it's super close to our house. The experience started out really well. There was a 30 min wait for 11:15am on a Sunday and the host was very nice, we told her we were going to look around in the kids store (KidStop) to keep our 4 & 2 year old occupied, she was so nice to walk down there to get us when our table opened up she sat us and our waitress greeted us promptly. We took about 10 min to order because it was our first time and the menu is pretty big with lots of delicious looking items. We then ordered, nothing complicated but this is when the problems began....an HOUR went by and we still didn't have our food and ALL the tables around us that ordered after us were getting their food. I was a restaurant manager before and I know that's not acceptable.  I went to try to get our waitress but she was avoiding us like we weren't her table. Another server brought my meal by itself and we waited 5 min before I sad anything to our waitress and she assured me the rest of the food was on its way. I told her just get my kids food out (it was just 2 Mickey Mouse pancakes) b/c they were hungry. Well we waited another 5 min before the rest of the food came out. The manager walked by and asked how everything was so we told him nicely and his response was, sorry! I know it's not an excuse but our kitchen is slammed! Said nothing and did nothing. After waiting for over an hour and for how hungry we were I would have expected the food to taste amazing but it was bland and disappointing. We will not be going back for $70 for 2 adults and 2 kids! If you want amazing breakfast food go to Butterfields. Their wait to get a table might be longer but Butterfields food comes out in 5 min from when it's ordered and the food is delicious and consistent. I don't know how Butterfields kitchen is so efficient but Eggstasy needs to take note from their operations and table turn. Long story short Eggstasy was not worth the wait or $ for the quality of food and the lack of care with the manager and server. And the thing that made me most upset is the issue was never addressed or acknowledged. We had to say something in order to get a lame excuse.
1401	1	a	If you want a quiet breakfast this place is not for you. If you want great food then come here. In addition to traditional breakfast fare there is a huge selection of unusual omelettes and specialty crepes. Good service. A little pricey for breakfast but definitely worth it.
1402	0	a	"We were excited to try this, but our experience was less than the \""surreal dining experience\"" promoted on the menu. Our party of two waited 25 minutes to be seated at the bar alongside people who arrived after but we're seated before us. We were greeted by three of the 8 or so people working behind the bar, none of whom offered us any beverages until I had asked three times for water and coffee. (Our server actually argued with me about my request stating that being seated is not a guarantee of fast service.) The beef brisket biscuits and gravy we ordered was actually sausage gravy, and the truffle French toast with asparagus and fried egg was good but not great. The highlight was the coffee, but not even that was worth the wait and poor service."
1403	0	a	Really neat space, but SO loud.  Could barely hear the person sitting three feet away from me.  \n\nThe service was super slow and there were obvious kitchen / server / management issues.  \n\nWe waited nearly 50 minutes for our food.  We weren't offered a discount, a drink or anything while we painfully waited while the staff was imploding.  \n\nAt least the food was really tasty when it finally arrived!!  Perhaps I will give them another shot, but not anytime soon.
1404	1	a	Pumpkin Cheesecake Pancakes may be one of the greatest things I have ever eaten in my life. They are a perfect combination of sweet but not too sweet. This is going to the top of my list of breakfast joints. Eggs were fluffy and nice large portions were served. Nothing like enjoying breakfast outside in the beautiful Arizona weather. There are some issues with service, not fast and not all that attentive but the pros greatly outnumber the cons.
1405	1	a	Delicious food + grapefruit mimosas + a bartender that looks like Jon Snow = an amazing Sunday.\n\nI typically don't comment on servers/bartenders looks because that invites all sorts of attention, but DAMN the bartenders here were some good lookin' boys. \n\nAnyway. I'm engaged. Ahem.\n\nMy best friend lives a couple blocks away so we walked over on Sunday morning. It looked like there would have been a lengthy wait, but they had 2 seats open at the bar outside, which was perfect. We made friends with the salty old gent to my right and proceeded to peruse the menu, which had MANY options. I was almost overwhelmed.\n\nWe ordered:\n\n- Chocolate covered bacon: Do it. Don't ask questions. Thank me later. (You're welcome.)\n- Joe P's Protein Cakes: Gluten free! Berries! FOUR OF THEM! (Too much, if you ask me.) They were very thick, so if I had known there were 4 of them I might have ordered something smaller.\n- Chicks in Blankets: Chicken sausage inside pancakes. Yum!\n- Coffee: my first cup wasn't that hot but the second one was, and both were delicious.\n- Grapefruit mimosas: Just the right amount of bitter and sweet. I could have had a few of those without thinking twice.\n\nA great thing about the bar: there are hooks underneath! I always loath having to hold my purse or put it on the bar, so this was welcome.\n\nMy ONLY complaint is that it was sometimes difficult to get the attention of the servers/bartenders. But they were nice to look at so it really wasn't an issue.\n\nTL;DR: Decently priced, delicious food and drinks, but sometimes the wait might be long.
1406	0	a	Pretty disappointed.  Over crowded,  omelet was dry, and waitress not very attentive.  Most of the people I was with were not very happy with their meals.  Portions were very substantial, that is a plus.
1407	0	a	Not what I expected. The service was soooo slow and the food was just OK .   It took about an hour to serve us our food.
1408	0	a	This place is beautiful yet the food was mediocre. We left there and we were very unhappy! The food took forever to come out (being with two young kids was not fun with the long wait), our bill came out to $80 with tip ( 2 kids and 2 adults). The omlete was over cooked and didn't taste good at all (don't remember what the name was but it had a balsamic glaze on it). Never again coming her again!
1409	0	a	I really wanted to like this place, I really did. It looked so cool and had a neat menu. I didn't mind the 30 minute wait for my table, but...\nFirst of all the place was absolutely chaotic! Servers, food runners and bussers running into each other. I watched a table get wiped down 3 times by 3 different people with a dirty cloth that smelled like a school cafeteria. There seemed to be no communication with each other bc everyone seemed confused. I ordered a juice which took longer than it should bc they have one juice area and it was crowded with servers. \nNow for what I really minded...\nMy food took about 35 minutes to come out and when it did, it was all wrong and tasted terrible. Hash browns are made in house but even after ordering them crispy, they came out wet and undercooked in the center. The only thing crispy was the outside. My eggs were ordered over medium but came out so undercooked. Just white slime on top. The sausage links are butterflied and you get 2 links instead of 3 like every other breakfast place. They obviously slice them so it looks like more. I didnt really mind that bc I can never finish 3, but I didn't like the taste. My English muffin was thick and doughy, not toasted. DISASTER! I just sent it back and asked for a pancake after they offered me something else. It never came...\nIt was a complete waste of an hour and a half that I could have had for holiday shopping!  The 2 stars are for the really nice hostesses up front
1410	0	a	Went here on Friday morning as my GF and I are looking for a solid new breakfast place in Scottsdale.  Many have been tried, none have succeeded so far.  So we found Eggstasy.  Let me say this first...it wasn't terrible.  The pancakes were decent.  The Ultimate Omelet that we had was very fresh tasting, which is a plus.  The food was actually fine.  So why the 2 stars? (Really, i would have given 2.5 if I could)  I just didn't like the atmosphere.  What is it with places in Scottsdale that have an overall douchey hipster feel to it?  It a breakfast joint for God's sake!  Why the need for the odd christmas decor? (upside down christmas trees?) And what the fuck was up with the 'coffee'?  It's some sludge that couldn't be fixed.  Fucking awful.  The little ray of sunshine that was our waitress wasn't all that great either.  Most places I don't think that are that great, I just don't go back to, but I want to give this place another shot.  One more note.  If the old lady who came around to say hello to us happens to be the owner, please take a moment to appear as an owner, and not some other customer just making the rounds.  Nothing about you coming to our table made me feel like you were the owner of the place, considering all I saw you doing before was sitting at another table across the way, as if you were just another customer.
1411	0	a	Finally a new breakfast place!  But oh, the disappointment...\nHave tried Eggsasy 3 times, hoping each time that the next visit would be better.  \nThe decor was great, but wish they would have put as much effort into the food.  \nHostesses dressed like nightclub cocktail waitresses at 8:00 in the morning?  Um, ok.\nMenu was very large and had lots of options, unfortunately it has gotten them in trouble, as nothing I have ordered was any where near delicious.  Super loud in the dining room.  And very exspensive for sub-par food.  This kitchen needs to revamp the menu so they can focus on quality, not quantity!
1412	1	a	I really like this joint, with HUGE portions and a really interesting menu....something for everyone. I had a proper eggs Benedict and my date had corned beef hash and eggs....the hash browns are delishooooo and the bread is extra special, certainly from a local bakery and thickly sliced. We had to try the grits and they were really good...cheesy and chorizo, but we could not eat them all. Split them if you have 4 people. Reason for 4 stars? Dirty coffee cup, fork, and glass. Nice bright new place with dirty dishes?!?!
1413	0	a	The place was freezing cold.  The service was very poor, we almost got up to get our own coffee we sat so long waiting.  The Whole Wheat French toast is to be avoided, it came off the light menu.  It is a whole wheat bread in egg whites with fresh fruit.  What I got was 3 thick pieces of bread VERY lightly toasted with almost no egg on them at all.  The fruit is dumped onto the bread (not mentioned in item description).  So what you end up with is toast with syrup.  The decor is, well there is none.  The walls are all completely blank of any and everything.  I do not even remember a mirror in the bathroom.  As I was leaving I almost got knocked over by a waitress as she bulled past me without even looking up or acknowledging she almost hit me.  I was sad because I really wanted to like this place.  I may go again and see if it changes or if it was just a bad day.  Oh and the place was so insanely loud and noisy that it was hard to speak to the people at my table.
1414	0	a	How this place has 4 overall stars is beyond me.  I took my son here a few weeks ago & I'm still ticked off about our experience.  First off, let me start with the only positive thing I have for this restaurant...it has a very cool modern look and feel, which I like.\nNow for the rest of our experience...the music is so loud you can barely hear anything else, so I opted to sit outside.  The patio is quite large, but has absolutely no shading from the sun, it's Arizona, the sun is out 95% of the year!  I had to move my son 3 times to try & keep the sun out of his eyes.  Next, it took over 10 minutes for anyone to come over & greet us, and take a drink order.  When the waiter finally came by, I could barely hear him or understand him because he was talking so soft, I swear he was on something by the way he was acting.  I asked if we could go ahead and place our food order since my son was getting really hungry & restless.  I ordered buttered noodles for my son and bacon and eggs for me, it took 40 minutes to get our food!!!  The place was not even that busy.  I will say that the eggs were really good, but when I picked up the bacon, the grease dripped off in a huge puddle, like it was not even drained off, yikes!  Now for my son's food, he will eat just about anything you put in front of him, but as soon as he put the noodles in his mouth he spit them right back out, I have no idea what they did to them, but he just wouldn't eat them.  I told the waiter when he finally walked by again that he just couldn't eat them & asked if I could I order something different & he said that was fine & he said he would take it off the check.  I asked him to see if they could rush it & 25 minutes later, still no food for my son, I called the waiter over & he said the kitchen was really busy & couldn't give him a timeframe as to when the food would be out (again, not a ton of people in there at this time), so I said to just cancel the new order & asked if I could have the check.  He brought the check & it still had the buttered noodles on it, so I called him over again and reminded him that he said he would take it off, he then proceeded to argue with me about taking it off the check, I asked to speak to a manager & he told me that no managers are employed there...what?!?!?!  He finally got snarky and said he would take it off.\nNot a good experience at all for us or for the other 4 tables around me from what I observed.
1415	0	a	Just had brunch...nothing eggstraordinary (pun intended)!  Hot chocolate was cold, service was a tad slow and Dali's omelette was boring!  If you are wanting brunch, there are many better places in this part of the world.
1416	1	a	Just stumbled upon this place by chance on a Sunday morning. Long wait is usually a good sign. The food was excellent. Very creative spins on the usual stuff. I had the stuffed brioche French toast and my wife had the salmon omelet. Both were excellent and had so many side dishes we have enough leftovers for dinner!
1417	1	a	Huge omelet portions and fresh squeezed OJ. If only I wasn't working I would have loved to taste a mimosa. The food was delicious; the menu is quite extensive. They have a pretty big outdoor patio that from what I heard gets pop'n for brunch. A must try while visiting Phoenix.
1418	1	a	I tried eggstacy this weekend and it was great. The menu was huge, which is great for picky eaters. There are a ton of things I could have tried. I went with the waffles, eggs and bacon. Great all around. I loved that the fresh fruit was in big chunks and nothing gross or wimpy like those generic little fruit bowls with Honeydew.  \n\nThe look & feel is great. The only exception is the group of tables next to the large kitchen opening, I wouldn't want to sit there, or at the tables that are essentially right in the doorway.
1419	1	a	New breakfast place on the Shea corridor. They have some real unique dishes with a European flavor. Really good coffee tho it can get a little loud in there. Get there by 10am or you will have a wait. Enjoy!
1420	1	a	DELICIOUS! really great service and HUGE portions. Very fresh and hip atmosphere. Lots of attention to detail. There is a huge out door seating area lots of interesting flavors for pancakes. I really wanted a coffee but didn't and the espresso smelled SO GOOD. This place is great!!! We went on our lunch hour and it was quick service for a large group!
1421	0	a	If this place thinks it's a spa, they are wrong. I waited 20 minutes to be asked to sit at a table, then asked to move. My nail tech said all of two words to me while talking to everyone else in a foreign language. There's a sign above the nail polish stating if you break one of their ancient bottles, you'll be paying for it. There's some decrepit lotions in a corner cabinet and a spray tan booth for sale. Yet, they were busy. My nails turned out fine ($15 for a fill) but I won't be back.
1422	0	a	Went once because it was close to home, definitely not going back. The man who did my nails was rude and said I was no fun because I didn't want wine. Really? I just wanted to have some quiet time and relax!
1423	0	a	Sooooo I think I missed the memo on this one. I'm a bit confused about all the hype surrounding this place. \n\nMy dining partner and I paid \u00a320 to drink out of plastic cups, eat with plastic forks and scoop our dinner off a tray in a chilly fast food environment. I had to eat with my jacket on (and I noticed everyone else in the place did too, so it wasn't just my reptilian temperature). How is this a good experience for the money? \n\nThere are plenty places that serve just as good burgers and chips for the same money in a much better environment, offering a far superior experience. \n\nThe food was ok. The chips were good, but my veggie burger was only luke warm when I got into it, the patty oozed out over the bun and without decent cutlery or a plate it was a bit of a nightmare to eat. \n\nSorry, but this did not impress me in the slightest and I came away feeling ripped off. If you want fast food go to McDonalds or Burger King and save yourself the cash. If you want half-decent grub then go to a pub or cafe and have a better experience for the money. The posh fast food idea doesn't do it for me at all.
1424	1	a	This place the only boba place next to my place, they are good but only have two sizes 16oz and 24oz pricing at 4.25 and 5.50...They don't have that much flavors but it could be because they are new.  I got thai tea and it's good... my friends got red guava and mango snow and they  really like it..... the place is cute and bright... they also have snack running from 5.95 to 6.95...
1425	0	a	I was looking forward to a Boba place near this side of town, but I was disappointed. I ordered  a 24 oz Lychee snow with Boba which came to about 6 bucks. I expected milk in my snow slush, but there wasn't  any. The Boba was 'eh' texture, not soft enough. The lychee flavor was there, but seemed syrupy with chunks of lychee. I also found a few big chunks of ice still at the bottom. I wouldn't recommend this place.
1426	1	a	Finally a new boba place by my house. It used to be Lollicup coffee and tea before, but I'm glad it's another boba place, probably with a new owner. I love their new interior design, they renovated the place.. (As you can see in the photos). Service was great, the girl who helped us was really friendly. She also said if we didn't like what she suggested, we can return it and exchange it to a different drink. The drink tasted really good but the boba needs improvement, usually boba are soft and chewy.. not all of the boba were chewy, some are hard in the middle. The egg rolls was delicious! It came out hot & fresh, i almost burnt my tongue!
1427	1	a	Wow. This place was due for a good boba place and its here! Clean and good boba; they even have a rewards type thing that I see all the boba places back in California have. I had the taro but would recommend milk tea or Thai tea for first time drinkers.
1428	0	a	"Went back to Jt boba house. Thought I would give them another chance. Omgad! I seriously wanna slam my drink on the counter & say, I WANT MY REFUND. But me, I know better not to do that. Anyways, went there last night and got myself a strawberry & kiwi flavor tea with boba & jam. I thought I would try jam because when I had it in Cali. Omg, I was amazing. Had it here, it was a failure. Everything about my drink was just a no no!!!! Plus I even asked my boyfriend how was his Thai tea. He said \"" it taste water down\"" then I asked my little sister in law how was her lychee drink. She said \"" I hardly can taste anything but water\"". Fix your drinks because its definitely not good at all. Never coming here unless someone pays for my drink but I probably just get myself a cup of water :)\n\nSincerely, a customer that knows what's good & whats not good"
1429	0	a	I was excited to hear there was a boba place opening near my house and I didn't have to travel all the way to Bombboba or Yo & I anymore just for good boba. My kids told me they've tried it when the place first opened and that the boba was terrible. I figured I'd give their milk tea boba a try, you can't mess up milk tea, right?! I was wrong. My milk tea was pretty weak though I've been told the boba has improved since they first opened. \n\nI asked the girl behind the counter about a menu item and she had no idea what I was talking about. Granted she wasn't Asian and didn't know what banh mi Or a Vietnamese sandwich was, but better training would help. Why have it on the menu and not have your employees be knowledgeable about it?!
1430	1	a	I love me some boba, so I was stoked to see this place pop up not so far from where I reside. Checked it out and thought it was pretty swell. I mean, they have a long list of flavors to choose from and they offer half off on any one item to Yelpers who write a review (and no, it doesn't say it has to be positive). If you like boba tea, and you like variety, I'd advise you to check this place out.
1431	1	a	Great place very great people! America's Best AMT crash courses,LLC recommends this place! The best boba drink is the house drink very good! Also, kenja was a great help and makes the drinks very delicious! JT boba did great on hiring staff.\n\nLocation needs to stand out more\nInside well maintained and clean \nFood was great! \nTvs inside great for kids and adults \nOverall 10+ stars on this location. \n\nAmerica's Best AMT Crash Courses,LLC
1432	1	a	I am on business trip in Avondale and find JT Boba House. \nDecoration is so modern and neat.\nService was very friendly and helpful.\nI tried their Taro Milk Tea with boba and I loved it!!\nTaro milk tea was so yummy and so as their boba.\nBoba is lightly sweetened with chewy texture. Just the way I like~~~\nIf I came to visit this area in the future, I will definitely come to this boba place again.\n\nI decided to come back today before I headed back to LA. I was told they serve green boba. It is so X'mas feel. So I decided to order Strawberry Snow with Green Boba. What else can make it look more like a X'mas color?!!! \nI was pleased by the drink presentation and took the first sip. OMG!! Strawberry Snow was so delicious~~~ : ) I could even tasted the small bits of strawberry pulp. Green boba was nice and chewy like their regular boba. I was fully satisfied by this holiday drink~~~~ Well done, JT Boba House!!!
1433	0	a	"Very disappointed but will give a pass.  After a phenomenal first experience two weeks ago at the new location in East Liberty, our second experience was the complete opposite.  I know its still in the soft opening phase but things need to turnaround pretty quickly.  The service was horrible.  It started with no wine glasses and went downhill from there.  the guacamole was almost inedible and the queso was also not very good.  My friends meal was missing two ingredients and they had to bring them on the side.  All of our meals were very dry.  Nothing about the meal was very good.  The waiter couldn't answer any questions because he kept saying he was \""vegan\"".  He also ran the same credit card through twice.  I know they are still working out the kinks but things need to improve quickly for this location to succeed.  We will go back but will be waiting for this to happen"
1434	0	a	"Had one of the worst dining experiences in recent memory here.  If they weren't claiming to still be in their soft opening I'd give them one star.  \n\nThe chips and guacamole were embarrassingly bad.  The chips were some sort of store bought Trader Joe's crappy tortilla chips.  At least have the decency to give me Tostitos.  The guacamole may have once been green but I'm not so sure.  The portion was tiny for $6, but frankly it didn't matter because it wasn't worth eating anyway.  My rice was dry, my veggie taco flaccid.  Their salsa verde was delicious.\n\nThe service was atrocious.  The place wasn't even full and our server was complaining about being swamped in the kitchen.  We ordered our entrees and waited...and waited...and every time a server walked out of the kitchen we hoped it was our food.  Our server headed for our table and let us know that she \""just found out\"" that they were out of chiles rellenos.  This was at a time when we should have been finishing up our meal, but instead we're starting from scratch.  I explained that we were in a bit of a hurry as we were trying to get to a concert, so please bring whatever can be made quickly.  Again too much time passed and eventually our mediocre food came.  And it took forever to pay the bill, of course.  All in all it took over an hour to get 7 tacos in a not full restaurant.\n\nI am in no way a high maintenance diner and I understand mistakes happen, and I'm completely open to giving restaurants a chance to make it right.  But once I explained we were in a hurry (due to their incredibly slow pace) there was no sense of urgency on their part.  I won't be heading back."
1435	0	a	I had very high hopes for this one: 500+ reviews and 95% likes is no easy task. (Urban Spoon)\nThis restaurant has now moved to Highland Ave in East Liberty.\nFirst, the service was very good. Our server was a bit shy and did not appear to be really experienced, but that was perfectly fine by me: she was very sweet and attentive.\nThe food pretty much sucked. The tortilla chips were very inauthentic and store bought tasting. It seemed like they just dumped them out of a bag. The salsa was okay. My jerk chicken burrito was okay but not all that exciting. The presentation left a bit to be desired: it was on a tiny plate with nothing on the side or on top or anything. More importantly, my husband had to send back his goat entree because it was very cold in the center, as if it had been frozen. When he got it the second time, it was hot, but didn't have the same spice as before and suddenly had a side of plantains but way less sauce than before. In the end, it was okay, but showed that there isn't really consistency in the kitchen.\nKeep your front of house people (although you probably didn't need FIVE people standing around...) but the kitchen needs to get their act together.
1436	0	a	"We dropped by last week to see what Casa Rasta is all about. Having read tons of rave reviews about their previous location, I was very excited to see that they had moved close-by.\n\nMy wife and I had an unexpected afternoon off, without the kids. I pulled out my phone, and consulted it for lunch suggestions. To my surprise, I saw that Casa Rasta had moved nearby, and we decided to check it out. \n\nWe rolled in for a late lunch and found the place to be quite empty - which was somewhat shocking. How could such a fabled place be empty? I admit we were a little worried... There was only one other table occupied there, but they seemed to be enjoying it, so we stayed.\n\nFrom the time we sat down at our table, to the time our orders were taken, it was at least 15-20 minutes. The waiter was friendly enough, but it just seemed like things were off at the restaurant. Not that I'm always in a hurry, but it would have been nice to get the ball rolling early with some drinks and an appetizer while we looked through the menu. Well, that didn't happen either. When we did get the chips and guacamole, they really did seem like Trader Joe's midlevel stuff. Would have been nice to have warm, salty and thin tortilla chips and guacamole that was freshly made table side, especially since the restaurant isn't too busy.\n\nWe ordered 4 tacos to share. They do offer a broad variety of different flavor options... but... they pretty much all tasted the same. The best ones were the jamaican jerk and conchinita pibil. The seasoning was off, and everything was actually rather bland. The corn tortillas for the soft tacos were decent, and held up well to the fillings.\n\nI guess it's hard to move away from your original spot and end up right next to a tex-mex place across the street. I would have liked to taste more \""fusion\"" between Caribbean and Mexican food, concentrating on really awesome new ideas, and tighten things up. I'm always looking for that next innovative spot which beckons my taste buds, but it has to be good, and it can't merely live off past successes.\n\nThere are lots of \""competitors\"" in this niche, with Patron just across the street and Smoke opening up soon in Lawrenceville - I hope Casa Rasta was just having an off day early during their soft opening days, and I wish them well. We will wait a few months to come back and see how things have changed, once they have had time to settle in."
1437	0	a	Another business across the street that I really wanted to like. The service was friendly.  They even had live music the night we went. But the food.\n\nWe had both kinds of salsa. It was okay. Chips were a little greasy but better than being from a bag.  Whatever.  I ordered some kind of taquitos after having no idea what the server was telling me.  Unfortunately, they were just not good. I'm a picky eater, but even +1 had to agree with me.  It had a smokey flavor in the way that your pap's scotch or dog bacon would.. as if they just poured it on. The rice and beans were okay, but no better if I microwaved them myself.\nI don't even remember what +1 ate, so it couldn't have been great. We even had churros for dessert (told you I was really trying here!); good, but undercooked. \n\nAfter the rave reviews of the Beechview location, you'd think this would do just as well.  I'm hoping this might be that new restaurant trouble, but for now, I'd avoid it.
1438	0	a	"We haven't even received our food yet and have been told that they are out of the following:\n1. Kids cups\n2. Guacamole (!)\n3. Avocado fries \n4. Quinoa and cilantro soup\n5. Red chorizo\n6. Red salsa (one of the two salsa options)\n\nWhen our facial expressions clearly registered disbelief, the explanation given was, \""We had a busy night last night so we ran out.\"" So this means they don't make fresh food for lunch when they run out of things?! We aren't here at an odd time either - it's Saturday at noon!\n\nIn this era of instant online reviews, one would think that a restaurant (especially in prime real estate) would make more of an effort.\n\nUpdate: The food is not redeeming. Hard rice, salty beans, and lukewarm entrees (clearly just barely defrosted). They forgot to bring out the chips we ordered. It was awful all-around."
1439	0	a	Damn shame, this place. I had been to the location in Beechview a couple of times and loved it, but the widely reported startup problems here persist. Service was clumsy and slow. \n\nOne of us had tacos, liked the pulled pork but didn't like the jerk chicken as much. \n\nOne of us ordered shrimp burrito; it arrived cold, and was dry and entirely unappealing. \n\nI ordered oxtails, clearly pulled from the refrigerator and quickly reheated, gristly and not as flavorful as I expected, served with rice in a nondescript tomato sauce along with a couple of slices of good fried plantain. I'm just hoping I don't get sick. \n\nMaybe there is a Peter Principle operating here. Prospects of these folks succeeding in Eastside as they did in Beechview, where the operation was less ambitious, seem low.
1440	0	a	"You can pass on this one. This is a product of the gentrification of east liberty and should be treated as such. It's fake fake fake.\nWent here for takeout with a craving for jerk chicken. I would have been much better served to drive a little farther to Impressionz on Broad street. The food was hotter than it should be to be so bland.  I ordered the jerk chicken but got the curry chicken by mistake. It was spicy but overall bland and overpriced. The portion size was also smaller than you would get elsewhere. The jambalaya was also very spicy but without real flavor. I also tried the avocado fries which could have been good but were too greasy. I didn't try any of the \""latin\"" dishes but I won't go back. There is really good Jamaican food in Pittsburgh but you will have to go to the \""hood\"" to get it. Don't go here for it."
1441	1	a	This is the best haircut I've ever had.  Adrienne was friendly, experienced, and very meticulous.  I'm looking forward to my next hair cut.
1442	1	a	Love love love my hair.   Can't say enough about the cut, the color and the service.  Adrienne rocks!   Don't know what I'm going to do this summer without her!

I chose Overnight Prints to actually get some business cards \""Overnight\""  Their advertising leads you to believe that you will get your cards overnight...as well as their High cost of shipping.

1445	0	a	My graphic designer helped me to order 100 business cards from here. I paid extra for heavy stock and rounded corners. I could only use half of the cards because the other half had horrible looking creases in them on the top. I sent a picture and asked for a resolution. The customer service person (James) kept making weird requests requiring me to jump through multiple vaguely described confusing hoops. I finally gave up, and my graphic designer ordered them from somewhere else at no additional cost to me. I think that overnight prints lost more than just my business by being ridiculous.

One minute 250 cards are about $35 dollars and the next  they are $150.! This company uses every trick in the book to deceive the customer."
1447	0	a	Will never use them again. Their shipping promises are for the birds. Do not count on the cards arriving when they say they will.
1448	0	a	I first used this company in about 2006 and have used it at least once a year and sometimes more, for business and personal projects.  This year I had post cards printed that included eight photos, only two of which are visible, the rest are too dark to be seen.  Although in the past there had been a quality problem, they had quickly resolved it, which gained my loyalty.  In this case after several back and forth correspondences I was ultimately told that they cannot guarantee a perfect color match and are unwilling to make it right.  This is not about a perfect match, it is about an unusable product which I will have to throw away.
1449	1	a	Enjoyed regular Greek salad for lunch today. Great food. Large portions. Indoor and outdoor seating available. Good prices. Friendly staff and clean. Definitely worth checking out.
1450	1	a	Very nice people , really glad to have them in the area. Great lamb and chicken pitas! Not much else to say that hasn't been said, Ive only had the sandwiches but will have many more.
1451	0	a	Never thrown away falafel, so this place was a new low for me. I had the falafel platter...there weren't many falafels (4) and they were terrible. Tasted more like hushpuppies.\n\nThe side salad (Greek, I guess) was covered with a shredded cheese of some kind (maybe feta?) but there was way too much of it...cheese with a side of lettuce. Hardly any red onion or tomato on it.\n\nI really wanted to like this place--and perhaps it is good for meat eaters because of the supposedly giant proportions but we won't go back. It was the worst falafel I've ever tasted.
1452	1	a	I absolutely love this place! Great food, great service, and huge portions. I usually get the village salad with grilled chicken on top, the salad is not on the menu but you have the option of ordering it. The gyro platter is huge and big enough for two people to share. Wonderful little place that I will continue to visit as long as I can get my village salad.
1453	0	a	"I stopped in at Nino's today for the first time. I am moving around the corner from them in a couple of weeks, so I thought I would try the new \""neighborhood\"" joint. \n\nI left unimpressed.  I ordered a gyro combo, with greek salad and drink.  The price was very reasonable, at $7.95.. I asked for both without tomatoes. When they brought the tray to my table a few minutes later, I immediately noticed tomatoes in the salad. The girl apologized and had them make me a new salad.  The gyro was on a \""standard\"", grocery store quality 6 inch pita. The meat, while a generous portion, was the generic, processed gyro meat. There was a very small amount of tzatziki  sauce on it, so the gyro was dry.. The salad was again a nice portion, but the cheese sprinkled on top did not taste like feta.. Maybe just a very bland goat cheese. None of the flavor that a good feta provides. And my biggest complaint on the salad was the dressing. I have had many a Greek Salad in my day, and they always come with an oil and vinegar based dressing, with oregano, lemon juice, etc.. This salad had what tasted like Ranch as the dressing. \n\nI try to frequent small, mom and pop owned businesses when i can. But I won't pay my hard earned money for something that doesn't live up to my expectations.. \n\nIf you want some good, inexpensive Greek food, try Greka Pita at Camelback Colonade instead.."
1454	0	a	Let me start off by saying the food was really pretty good.  I love gyro's and theirs were tasty.  The downside was the service was really slow.  The first time I went I thought maybe it was because they just opened and needed to get their service groove on.  the second time I went again it took about 30 minutes to get my take out order.  It was later in the day and no other customers were ahead of me.  I feel like that location is just cursed to not be successful.  It has been 3 or 4 different places in the last few years.  It is a shame that it takes so long to get your food from them because the location is close to my apartment and I love me some Greek food.  If the owner or employees reply and let me know they have improved their speed I would give them another chance.  Otherwise I will keep looking for good Greek food in Phoenix.
1455	0	a	Is this place still open? This the 3rd time in the last week that it's not open at this time?
1456	1	a	nice hawaiian food, should try that anyway
1457	0	a	"#1 Hawaiian Barbecue. That's the name of this place.  I read on their website they opened a 2nd location on my side of town a few weeks ago. So while we were shopping in the area, we decided to check it out even though we already ate. \n\nIt's located in front of the Ross store in the shopping center near the airport. On the corner of Eastern and Oquendo. You can see the \""grand opening\"" flags from Eastern.\n\nFast casual place. Order and pay up front and seat yourself. The dining area sign says max capacity 50. There were about 2 other families dining in and I felt it was already cramped. The tables are too close together. Barely any walking space in between.  Cant imagine 50 persons in there. Place is clean though.\n\nThey serve the traditional favorites like bbq shortribs, kalua pork plate lunches with 2 scoop rice and 1 scoop mac salad. I thought it was cool I can skip the carbs and in place they include eggs. Great for those who want to boost their protein intake.\n \nTaste wise though it's between 'meh' and alright. It's missing a bit of the local 808 flavor and vibe for me.\n\nThe bbq shortribs I had wasn't the best quality. Then again the price was right for what I got. Judging by the Styrofoam boxes that I just threw out when I cleared out the fridge, safe to say that even my haole honey didn't think much of his Portuguese saugage and fried rice.  He has that dish all the time at other Hawaiian restaurants and  he cleans his plate. \n\nThe Taro smoothie was not too bad and the malasada I tried was okay. It's affordable though. It's just that I've had much better food at other places near me. \n\nStaff is nice but there was just a bit of a language barrier and ordering was a tad difficult. \n\nThe family that owns this place just opened a new Chinese restaurant next door though. Maybe I'll give that place a shot the next time I ever in the area. Cool points for having delivery service! Im just  not in no rush though for the dine in part."
1458	0	a	Typical copy cat Hawaiian food with similar menu of L&L but terrible greasy food and customer service. Save your good money and good stomach space for better food elsewhere. Still want HI food nearby, try L&L at Flamingo m Maryland.
1459	0	a	"Their name is \""#1 Hawaiian food\"" yet no one working there is Hawaiian. The food IS NOT Hawaiian. The girl upfront can't even answer your questions. My friend asked her if the chicken on the spicy chicken plate was breaded and she didn't know what we were talking about. The rice isn't sticky, it's hard, macaroni salad is bland, it's literally just Asian food trying to be Hawaiian. Ross J's is still #1 in town along with Aloha Specialties. This place is over priced and not authentic."
1460	0	a	First trip to El Tataki.  Atmosphere is trendy and nicely laid but, but feels unfinished and somewhat confused.  For example, white linens, polished concrete floors and walls,  great mix of music at a great volume for conversation, but 5 TVs playing football.  Are you trendy and a bit upscale or a sports bar?  Also, a giant heater laying on the floor and a neon open sign hanging from a nail in the ceiling with an extension cord running down the window make it feel like it is just unfinished.  \nThe food looks a bit messy.  My wife ordered shrimp tacos.  They were supposed to be just shrimp and pico  de gallo.  The tacos were a mess of chopped shrimp and sauteed pico de gallo.  Pico should not be cooked and shrimp should not be chopped in a taco.  The tacos were served with fried rice which was crunchy salty yet lacking any real flavor.\nI ordered a California roll, spicy tuna roll, and BSCR roll (a California roll with baked scallops on top).  I ate on piece of the california roll and stopped.  The rice was not sushi rice, the filling was pasty and tasted of mayonase.  The paper was tough and old as though the roll had been made the prior day.  If they can't get a california roll correct, I'm not gonna try the tuna.\nOverall, we left our meal unfinished and will not be back.  Very disappointing as the concept is very cool and the menu looks like it should be good.  Oh well.  Maybe they will make some changes and improvements to the quality and presentation of the food and we'll try again in the future.
1461	1	a	Came here just by chance and it was great I had the cielo mar y tierra roll and my wife had the tres quesos roll.  Service was great and we will be back again.
1462	1	a	What an experience! Let me start off by mentioning how cute the place is inside. The decor is really sheek and elegant with table cloths and big open windows. And then there's the food.... I got edamame, firecracker jalape\u00f1os and the mexican roll. I like spicy food and the sushi chef was more than happy to accommodate. He also told me he could do any traditional roll as well, but im not a traditional type of person so I went with a specialty roll. His roll was beautifully put together with a nice presentation. The firecracker jalape\u00f1os were excellent! Whole jalape\u00f1os cut in fourths and deep fried with cream cheese with a very nice sauce served on top (and not too much). On the side I was given an excellent mixed ponzu sauce that went great with everything!  My waiter was very attentive and pleasant! Not one complaint with the service! The owner was behind the bar and very friendly as well. Overall it was a great choice to eat!
1463	1	a	This place has a great concept. You can get a burrito and a sushi roll in one stop. The food was good and the waiter was attentive and nice. I wish they had some type of happy hour menu for lunch or something and they need to get horchata!
1464	1	a	"From the moment I walked in the door I was greeted by very friendly and welcoming service, the waiter took the time to ask if I had any questions about the menu and to recommend a few items. My drink order was taken very promptly and i was offered complimentary miso soup that was to die for. I decided to try a new roll tonight I went with the \""Culichi Roll\"" the plate was very presentable and I was highly pleased with the flavor. Truly do recommend this new restaurant if your in the mood for sushi or Mexican food. Will definitely be returning with more friends :)"
1465	1	a	Came here tonight with some friends and so glad we did! It wasn't a busy night for them, I don't know if it's just because it's a weekday or in a bad location. \n\nBut anyways, service was great the entire time we were there. No complaints at all, and thanks to our waiter for being so patient and giving us recommendations. We got 5 rolls for 5 people and we were stuffed. Here's what we got: (I might have forgotten some names...)\n\nGuamuchilito Roll- SO GOOD!\nGila Monster Roll- Very good, too rich to eat the whole roll by yourself though\nMileno Roll- Ehh...It's alright. Didn't know what I was eating really, and too cheesy\nVegas Roll- SO GOOD!\nMexican Roll- Good, a little spicey\n\nThe Vegas and Guamuchilito were my favorite tonight!!! MMM yummy rolls :)\n\nTheir credit card machines wasn't working, so they had to call it in, so it took a while for them to check us out, but we weren't in a hurry anyways. Also, it would be nice if they offer happy hour..I would go much more often! :)\n\nI would definitely recommend this place! Go give it a try!
1466	0	a	Terrible service. Not a busy night and the waitress took for ever to take out orders. Waitress did not no what alcohol was served. Waitress was rude, owner was rude.
1467	0	a	"The restaurant was empty an hour after the football game. This is a bad sign. We waited 30 min for our food. Our food was cold. One member of our party did not receive his meal with the remainder of the group. When the group complained the server said \""the cook is new and is messing everything up.\""  We paid for our drinks and left. Worst service ever. Horrible food. Several other parties walked out as well. Do not waste your time. Walk across the street to Gordon Biersch."
1468	0	a	Traffic was bad after the game. Decided to wait it out at this restaurant in the mean time. I would advise to just stay in your car or walk across the street to Gordon. Took an hour to get food and only got asked if we needed a round of beer once. My dad never even received his food. I understand when it's busy but the restaurant was almost empty. Upon receiving the food it was all ice cold. We told the gentlemen to take it all back and he said the cook is screwing everything up tonight. We told him to bring our check and we weren't  paying for this garbage. Another server dropped off the check and didn't say a word about the crappy food or service. A lot of the restaurants on this side of the road are out of business this one will be close behind. There were many others that got up and left with no management intervention.
1469	1	a	Very cool fusion sushi place!  Good food and good service. Definitely worth the stop.
1470	0	a	Visited for the first time today... Stopped in today for a couple California Rolls. Was in a rush to get back home for an online training class so I asked for them to go. Got home & they'd only given me the rolls. NO ginger, wasabi or anything. It occurred to me that perhaps this being a spot with sushi variations that perhaps they don't have it but I called anyway to ask. Server said that they DO have it, but only if you're dining in. :-0 I guess she heard the disappointment in my voice so she offered to pack some up if I wanted to come back. So we drove back & got the Ginger, Wasabi & Soy. Finally got back home & ate. Utterly disappointed. The nori was soggy & like, wilted & the flavor was more pungent than I've had before & because the rice was bland it really stood out. The wasabi was also horribly bland. No bite at all - the ginger had more punch than the wasabi! I always thought it was difficult to screw up a California roll, but I guess I was wrong! Some of the other menu items looked interesting though so I'm willing to trust that I just ordered too simple & am willing to try again with one of their specialties. That said - I won't make an effort to go again because the service sucked. I REALLY hate being inconvenienced for something I'm paying for.
1471	0	a	Use to be a small business fan of this place but our waitress(salene) was too busy flirting with the other customers to help us. The owner is related to her so our complaint went unresolved.  I've spent too much money there to be treated so disrespectfully.  Will never go back!
1472	1	a	"So I sit down and get an ice cold dos xx to get started after a stressed out day. My day was already getting better. The miso soup was delicious, The bartender recommends a roll called \""limon roll\"" and it was like he knew my taste buds. AMAZING!!!!!!! This roll didn't need Anything else, no soy, no sauce, no nothing. I get another beer, drink a glass of water, and I was on my way. Good experience I recommend this place to anyone that likes sushi or Mexican food (the tacos looked good) lol"
1473	1	a	Two nights ago feeling lazy about cooking, I was trying to decide where to dine that evening. I had thought about the new place, Jacques, but decided on the tried & true Woolghans in the Rampart casino.   Mistake!   While the food is serviceable, the service has gone downhill ! Long story short: I was suffering from diner's remorse for having overpaid for fish & chips and bad service.   Tonight, I dined @ Jacques . I ordered the seafood pasta.  The serving was generous, the pasta & seafood perfectly cooked, the tomato sauce was flavorful and light without overwhelming the pasta.  The price point with beverage and tip ran shy of $13....I felt redeemed from my bad dining choice of the previous night. While this is not a full service restaurant, the staff were pleasant and earnest in making a good impression-although I believe one staff person's question of whether I was having fun, I think,  meant to ask how I was enjoying my meal.   The decor is light and modern-a comfortable space.  It is exactly where you would want to go for a meal at the end of a busy work day or a simple evening out.  Jacques cafe is a no muss, no fuss, solid type of place.  No diner's remorse here......I will be back!
1474	0	a	"I had high hopes for Jacque's and it's great location.  Went for lunch with 4 friends.  The place is clean and tidy with decent new decor and ample seating, better use of space and decor than the last tenant, but held-over floor planning on the entry is confusing.  Here are the challenges that lead to this rating, in order of occurrence.  I hope they can fix them.\n\n1.  They seated us, then waited until we asked to send us back to the front where we were to order our own food at something of a counter, despite lots of wait staff.  Because the 'order yourself' Chipotle-style was not clear, it was aggravating.\n\n2.  There is no French food here.  The entire menu is variations on the American theme.  The categorization of French is a mistake.\n\n3.  Cappuccinos were served in big coffee mugs, basically a weak, too-much-milk latte with a little foam on top.\n\n4.  \""Asian Burger\"" was a dry, unseasoned small piece of lean ground beef that had been brushed with some kind of tempura or soy.  Nothing else asian about it.  \n\n5.  \""Salmon Burger\"" was dry, sparsely seasoned deep fried piece of fish on a bun with some lettuce.\n\n6.  SERVICE:  \n\nWhen one of our party asked them to fix the far-from-correct cappuccino, she was told \""I'll have to charge you for that.\""  \n\nWhen we were asked how everything was, we politely began to voice that the salmon sandwiches were not satisfactory (dry), but got hushed by the wait staff who told us \""I had it yesterday and it was good.\""  No offer of any kind to fix anything.\n\nSUGGESTIONS:\n\nJust take the orders at the tables and be done with it.  We ran up to the counter several times, sometimes while the wait staff was also arriving at the table.\n\nGet a barrista\n\nAdd some French food\n\nSeasoning, seasoning, seasoning\n\nTrain wait staff in customer service and satisfaction\n\nOverall, completely underwhelming to all in our party.  We were disappointed and hope the bugs can be worked out, as we'd love to return if they do."
1475	1	a	This is based only on one lunch time visit. \nThe line to order was short and quick. \nAs I had never been before I needed to scan the menu options for lunch. There is a small menu, but I prefer that. Too many choices become overwhelming.\nI settled on the brisket sandwich. It seemed that maybe the ingredients would not taste good together, but they tasted great.\nThe sandwich had brisket that was very tender with great flavor, sauerkraut, peppers, and cheese. I believe and aioli as well. The sandwich was delicious, the bread crunchy.\nIt comes with either a side salad or French fries. I chose the fries. \nIt was a lot of food. I ate half the sandwich, not many fries, they were good seasoned well. Just too filling.\nThe service was efficient. \nI look forward to going back to try another item from the lunch menu. \nThe prices were on point with the other places in the area.
1476	0	a	"We were super busy at work yesterday so our employer decided  to treat us to \""Free Food Friday\"". So we chose Jacques Cafe.  Once I got everyone's order,  I proceeded to call it in.  Whoever  took my order, was very friendly but it was as if she was not paying any attention to my order.  I was asked to repeat my order a few times and she kept apologizing, saying that her \""mind is drawing blanks right now\"". Here is what we ordered and what we received:\n1-Brisket Sandwich with mixed greens-\n1-Summerlin Soup-tasty soup,  but was a little too thin for my liking.\n1-Caesar Salad with Chicken (add avocado,  add bacon & add Asiago Cheese)-all we got was a Caesar salad  with some Chicken. None of the \""add-ons\"" were added to the salad.  But yet it was added to our receipt.\n2-East West Salad (add Chicken & bread on the side) No bread but the salad was very good.  I enjoyed the crispy chickpeas and dressing.  However,  If I ever order this salad again,  I will get it without the Shitake Mushrooms!! Totally made my salad smell like feet!! \nNot too excited for this place now that Ive tried it,  but \nI have given second chances before."
1477	0	a	2nd visit. Great food menu when I visited the 1st time! However, probably never ever going to sit at the bar ever again. Bartender had the bar skills of a 10 year old.  I sat at the bar, took the bartender 5 minutes to acknowledge me. I was the only one at the bar. Then when he finally acknowledged me, asked what I would like. I asked if he had any Moscato. He had no idea what that was. Then the phone rings, he answers then leaves me for ten minutes without taking my order. Then a server & a chef also passed by me asking if I needed anything. I told them I'd like to place an order as the bartender deserted me after I got trumped by a phone call that he took. They both giggled then moved on. What? Who trained them? Lack of customer service in a customer service, hospitality oriented city? Terrible!
1478	1	a	Drive in burger is absolutely delicious.. So much flavor! Sweet potato fries are on point. Not a fan of milkshakes but the peanut butter crunchy milkshake will make convert. Overall it's good, decent pricing and staff are friendly. Plus they have the cutest mason jars.
1479	0	a	"I've been here four times. Visits:  1) the food was tasty and quick. 2) This time I ordered carry out. When I got home food was missing from the order.  3) Ordered at the front desk. The food came out but was plated instead of to-go. After waiting nearly 10 minutes for the food to be boxed as originally requested I went to the counter to ask them what's up. The shaved headed cook in the kitchen wasn't happy with his staff and was telling then it took too long. I appreciated his acknowledgement and couldn't have agreed more. 4) Tonight I sat at the bar to order a beer and place a carry out order for my family. I was ignored by the blonde chick behind the bar for nearly 10 minutes while she focused solely on making a single smoothie for another customer. Not even as much as a smile or a \""Hello, I'll be right with you.\"" I walked out and am now waiting at Vintner Grill for my carry out order to appear. Fix your staff and you'll have a good place. Until then, I'm done."
1480	1	a	"Glad there's a healthy place nearby!!! \nMy beau surprised me with a nice meal after work from Jacques. This is what he ordered: \n-tofu avocado taco\n-garden burger\n-sweet potato fries\n-frozen yogurt with berries\n\nTofu tacos were delicious!!! Almost tasted like fish tacos! I could seriously eat those all day. Seasoning was just right especially when you add some lemon juice.\nGarden burger was also really good, although my only complaint was that the patty was too salty and a bit mushy. Wish that it was somewhat crispy to give the burger some texture.\nSweet potato fries were average, nothing special here.\nFrozen yogurt was great! But be warned... It doesn't taste like your average froyo, it tastes like actual yogurt that's still a touch sour, but is neutralized by the berry sauce or mochi that you add. I personally liked it, but then again I like \""different\"" tastes.\n\nJacques cafe was tasty and I'll definitely be back to try more of their dinner portion like pasta and short ribs. They also have a lunch menu that's under $10 so super affordable. And if your health conscious, all their foods are labeled with V (vegan) GF (gluten free)  A (ginger aioli). Good job, boyfriend!!!"
1481	0	a	"This could be a great place if they find a focus for their restaurant. I thought it was a French style coffee shop because of the name. They did have some French pastries, but the very small coffee selection menu was difficult to find, on a small chalkboard behind the register. They did not have an expansive coffee drink menu that you would expect from a \""cafe\"".  The food selection was also scattered. There was a few French items (the name \""Jacques\"" imparts it's a French place), but also pastas, sandwiches and burgers.  It's very nice inside and the staff were great, but I'm not really sure what this place is."
1482	0	a	Ordered salad and sweet potato fries, got 2 orders reg fries. Order taker could not tell me what was in veggie sandwich...said peppers, onions, lettuce and tomato. Wish small plates were available at lunch. Desperately in need of a manager on floor to oversee things and greet guest and tell them ordering process... People walk in and kinda wander around trying to figure out what to do. All the food was good so I think it's a case good back of house management but poor front of house. I sent an email to address on menu. got no response.. no webpage either...not smart in these times!
1483	0	a	Nice decor. The food is bland and super mediocre. Portions are small and overpriced. The menu is odd.  It's a shame because the spot looks great, too bad the food doesn't match. Would love another non-chain spot.
1484	0	a	I was excited to see they had spring rolls. I asked if they were NOT fried and wrapped in rice paper, and I was told they were.  When they arrived at the table, they were deep fried, in fact everything was deep fried.  How is this considered healthy?  I had a couple of bites before my stomach got queasy; I won't be back.  I gave an extra star for the staff was nice & friendly.
1485	0	a	"Giving two stars based on the food, location (walking distance from my house) and the decor are amazing... If it weren't for these things Id give negative stars, I've eaten here twice now and had very different experiences...\n\nA few days ago I came here for the first time and brought my mom and Andy. We were very impressed with the rustic decor and the outside setting. It's absolutely beautiful on the patio. \nWe had the butternut soup, that was phenomenal. Butternut squash with creme frise and leeks for garnish.  \nFor entrees we each had a different sandwich, I had the bbq brisket. I was expecting a bbq sauce since that's what the cashier told us.. but none of the less it was still great.\nAndy had the Pastrami sandwich which also was missing a sauce bit once we put their housemade Dijon mustard on it the sandwich was great. \nThe sweet potato fries are great as well! \n\nNow for the second trip...\n\nCame in last night (Tuesday around 7pm) and sat at the bar. We never received service, we waited about 10 minutes before we went up to the cashier. The girl told us the bartender never showed up so we had to order at the register. We ordered the calamari, shrimp tacos, and the butternut soup. I asked the girls (two blonde girls and one brunette) if there were any nuts in the tacos or the calamari. I AM DEATHLY ALLERGIC to tree nuts and peanuts. I've been admitted to the hospital twice with my throat closing due to my allergy. No one knew so they asked the cooks. They just shrugged and said there wasn't. When I asked if they were certain (i had forgotten my epipen at home because we walked to the restaurant) they started laughing at me. \nWe also ordered the Apricot Cider, so we took our drink and headed outside. When our food arrived we noticed the calamari was accompanied with a green sauce. The brunette told us it was a parsley sauce. We also noticed there weren't any leeks on the butternut soup... That made the soup very bland without the added flavor. \nWhen I tried a piece of Calamari dipped in the parsley sauce it really tasted like pesto. Andy and I headed inside to ask about it. Because pesto 90% of the time is made with Pine nuts. We were told yes it was pesto. Andy dialed 911 because no one knew if there were nuts in the pesto. NOT A SINGLE PERSON IN THE ENTIRE RESTAURANT KNEW. Then when I told the brunette girl my throat would literally close she LAUGHED and said oh don't be a drama queen, no it won't. ....\n\nWhat can I even say about that. 20 minutes later we finally found out the pesto was nut free. After me having a full blown freak out panic attack it completely ruined my experience here. When asked if they could bring us ice cream on the house we declined and the blonde girl asked what could she bring us and I jokingly said another drink, she immediately brought us another bottle of apricot cider with a receipt. Then said we could pay for that anytime. \n\nNow, I've worked in the service industry since I was 14. (13 Years now...) My professional opinion and advice is this, TRAIN YOUR STAFF. Especially the cooks. I can forgive a ditzy cashier girl but I can't forgive a \""chef\"" that has no idea what they're cooking. Hire a manager to oversee daily operations and handle guest issues. If this would have happened to anyone else I'm sure they wouldn't have been as nice as Andy and I. \n\nI want to come back. I liked the food and you can't beat the location. But these kinks need to be worked out before they kill someone, because no one is trained or held accountable."
1486	1	a	This is a cute cafe with organic food and a very relaxed atmosphere. You also have the option to dine outside which makes your experience even more relaxing.  Most of the menu items are gluten free and vegan which makes it a very healthy dining option. During lunch they offer combos, soup and salad or sandwich with soup or salad. I tried the summerlin soup which was just ok. However, the chicken sandwich was great, I would totally recommend it.  They also have a yummy selection of pastries and gelato! The customer service is great, they definitely try the best to connect with their customers and make you feel welcomed. \n Apparently they are also open for dinner!
1487	1	a	"I loved Jacque's restaurant from the moment I walked in. The food is organic, non GMO, hormone free and delicious! The counter service was great because they follow up with you after the order is placed. The staff is knowledgeable and very friendly. The restaurant looks amazing and the patio is gorgeous. I find it funny that there are so many reviews that talk about the lack of French food. I don't know where they are getting the idea that it's a French restaurant. It even says, \""casual american bistro\"" in several places. Maybe they have a reading problem.  I love the fact that they keep costs down by not employing waiters because you get the service without the cost. I asked for several things over the course of my meal and got everything in a quick and efficient manner. I will be returning for dinner and many days to come. Great job!"
1488	0	a	the place looks good and the prices make you believe you are in for a culinary treat.  you're not.  went today for sunday brunch.  small and scattered menu with nothing that stands out as a must try.  I opted for scrambled eggs.  I specifically asked that they be prepared soft and was assured they would be.  when they came out they were clearly overcooked as evidenced by the brown crust throughout and the unappetizing rubber texture.  the cashier that took my order asked if they were ok and she offered to have them replaced (I added a star for her efforts).  the new eggs that came out were equally bad as they were partially cooked and partially raw.  eggs are very hard to cook properly, however, there are literally thousands of youtube videos that show proper technique.  It can be done.   my companion's omelet was equally overcooked.  watch Jacques Pepin cook an omelet.  that's how it's done.  we also shared this thing that was a crabcake baked into some kind of pancake.  it was just weird.  way too much breading and the crabcake inside was blah.
1489	1	a	Here on a Sunday morning. Not very crowded   Nicely decorated, we enjoyed the ambiance and music. The menu said brunch and we were a bit confused thinking the LV buffet trough. But you order off a streamlined me it. \nThe Benedict had the freshest sauce I've ever tasted. The ham and egg omelet came with potatoes and fresh fruit. Very tasty. \nThe staff is very friendly and helpful. \nWe will have to try lunch and dinner another time.
1490	1	a	Excellent, healthy dishes and beautifully presented. Jacques is a master chef and artist. Love the ambiance.
1491	0	a	Is this place even open? Same problem they had when they were chill-n yogurt. Their yelp and grub hub both say they're open until 10, but when I show up at 8:15 they are closed. It's the only yogurt shop close to my house and I've never been so frustrated by a local business in my life. Get your shit together.
1492	1	a	I stopped by and checked out froyotime as I eat next door at zabbas frequently and noticed the new froyo shop going up.  It was really good, and the owners, who both were in the shop at the time, seemed like really nice people.  I had the Salted caramel and it was delicious, didnt even need toppings although they had a ton of those as well.  Will definitely be back!
1493	1	a	This place is great. It is fresh and clean and has a bright cheery feel. There is always a new flavor to try and lots of choices to choose from at the toppings bar. The owners are always friendly and great to talk to.
1494	0	a	Les plats principaux \u00e9taient corrects mais le service \u00e9tait, lent, mal organis\u00e9 et il y a eu plein d'erreurs. De plus les desserts n'\u00e9taient pas bon, la cr\u00e8me glac\u00e9e frite \u00e9tait liquide. Si je pouvais donner 0 \u00e9toiles je le ferais.
1495	1	a	My family is vegetarian and the food was amazing! We found our new fav Mexican food place in Laval! The music was loud and the place was happening. But there are booths available where a family can sit and have an amazing meal away from the speakers. Was disappointed with the spiceness level of their table sauces (4 kinda) and had to pay $1.50 extra for the hotter sauce. However the spicy(on request) vege burrito was delicious! My soft taco with cactus and avocado was savory and the spinach and cheese enchiladas was zesty! Will definitely come back.
1496	0	a	Nice decor, friendly service, good but far from great or unique pizzas; much needed\nsort of place in the area; BUT the noise level is beyond ridiculous. Was there for lunch at 1 pm mid-week, and sat at the bar with a friend. We were the only one's at the bar, and could barely hear ourselves speak. Anywhere else was much worse
1497	1	a	Le secret le mieux gard\u00e9 \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al. Excellentes pizzas qui rappellent l'Italie. Excellent service. Un must
1498	0	a	Just terrible. \n\nThe food wasn't bad, but for the price we paid - about 85 for two glasses of wine, two pizzas, and a salad, it didn't satisfy. The restaurant was much too noisy (they should have used acoustic tile!), but we made do. The service was lovely - they have an excellent set of waiters and waitresses who all had a great attitude, which is a rare find in Montreal!\n\nI genuinely felt bad for our waitress - she was clearly doing all she could to make sure that we were happy, but her manager (some fat, grumpy Italian guy) kept screaming at her and the other front of house staff. We just felt so terrible for all of them! It made for a rather uncomfortable meal.\n\nWhen our pizza arrived, we asked for fresh ground pepper. Turns out they don't have any. Our waitress said it was a decision of the management, which based on the rudeness we saw isn't at all surprising. \n\nBack to the food--- the wine selection was excellent, and we were mostly satisfied with our pizza. I ordered a primavera without cheese (vegan), and they were happy to accommodate. He had the margharita and said it wasn't bad, but wasn't the best he's had. As another reviewer said, nothing to write home about. \n\nOverall, it was ok, but I'd only recommend for people who are happy to spend upwards of $50 a person for a casual dining restaurant, and who don't mind witnessing a grown man throwing a tantrum.
1499	0	a	"SUCH a DISAPOINTMENT.  I wanted SO badly to love this place  as a local and pizza lover!!!!! This is my 2nd time eating here.  \nWe went in yesterday with our 3 year old- sat down and asked for pasta w/ butter and or parmesean cheese.  The answer was NO. ZERO kid friendly options in Westmount which has a lot of families makes no sense.  How can you not have pasta w/ simple parm cheese or butter? Thats nuts. Moving past that- we ordered the same soup as our first visit and salads. Taste just OK.\n\nService:\nAs we finish the salads, a server comes over and askes \""Would you now like some dessert or coffee\""? She obviously had no idea those are not main courses and no idea what we had ordered. \n\nI had ordered (just like our 1st visit) my pizza well done crispy. This didnt happen (same issue on our first visit) - The pizza came out soggy.  I literally took it to the oven myself where they fixed the problem.  \nTaste: Again, just \""Eh\"".  How can oven pizza not be amazing (none the less a margarita simple one) ? Such a shame.\n\nON THE TABLE displayed was  a picture of Nutella and Strawberries.  My 3 yr old said she would like that- i kindly asked for what was in the picture and the reply was that they do not sell strawberries and Nutella. OK so why picture it? \n\nCheck comes: Total 2 salads, 2 soups, 1 pizza (single sized), 1 Soda. Total $75. Overpriced. \n\nSide note- when you do get your act together- offer local delivery within a few blocks to get more business."
1500	0	a	Are they still open for business?  I've tried coming by a couple times but the lights are off and the doors are locked during business hours.  Not sure.
1501	1	a	2nd time seasoned veteran and still a blast~!\n\nAnother fun filled evening at Pinot's Palette!\n\nThis was a IGT team building event but its always good to see old friends! (IE Reid and Judy)\n\nWe had a new exciting experience of first, painting on our own or painting in pairs, all the canvas had different sizes and best of all, the painting was actually one whole picture! \n\nReid as promised bolted them together and we finally got it in! \n\nI am excited to post more photos up!\n\nHopefully there will be more styles of artwork like this! I can totally see this for couples or families to add a nice memory of a meaningful piece of art into everyone's homes :)\n\nIGT SALES OPS ROCKS! Yay!
1502	1	a	Had a lot of fun.  I'm not the best artist, but I think my painting turned out pretty good in the end.  Whether you are good or not though, it is a fun time.
1503	1	a	Awesome place with an awesome atmosphere, awesome staff and awesome classes! Okay, that's enough awesomes, but you get the picture! Ha, see what I did there?!\n\nLast night, I went with a date and it was an extraordinary experience. From beginning to end, it was just around crazy cool. My partner bought us two spots to paint Van Gough's Almond Blossoms. It was super easy, well, if you aren't trying to be perfect.\n\nAfter two hours, I was satisfied with my experience. They had great music playing, a good selection of wine for purchase and an available staff to aide at any moment. Seriously? \n\nPaint. Wine. Have fun! Best motto ever.\n\nIf you're looking for a date night activity, choose this place. I was a beginner and had a terrific experience. Oh, and bring something you don't mind getting dirty just in case! \n\nWhen you're finished with your painting, you get to take the canvas home and it's a great memento.\n\nFive stars. Hands down. I can't wait to check out another class!!
1504	1	a	I used to pretty much live at PSC and I ate Phillys at least 3 or 4 days a week. I've had a lot of sandwiches. The meat used here is better tasting, and a higher quality cut. The bread is phenomenal. Had a sandwich last night and the bread was toasted to perfection. Cheez whiz is cheez whiz. Their pizza bites were bomb. Looking forward to when they can serve booze as well. \n\nStaff is friendly and attentive. I'll be going back for sure. The decor is pretty awesome overall as well.
1505	0	a	We had horrible service. The employee stated any speciality pizza could be ordered by slice but failed to mention that you were charged per topping. Paid $25 for 2 slices and 2 drinks. Employees were swearing while we were seated behind them. And everyone unprofessional. Seemed at the time only employees friends were in the restaurant. Pizza was not worth the money
1506	1	a	"Wow! And by \""wow,\"" I mean WOW! This is easily one of the best pizza/cheesesteak joints in the area. \n\nJust ordered delivery from here. I've visited before as well, but wanted to sample a bunch of different things before a verdict. I got a slice of pizza, a cheesesteak, some mac and cheese bites, chicken fingers, and a fried s'more. I know it sounds like a lot - that's because it is a lot. I tend to order too much when I buy things online, also I was planning on leftovers and sharing with the gf. \n\nThe pizza \""slice\"" was 1/4 of a pizza. I'm not kidding. It was literally just a slice from a pizza cut into 4ths. Not sure if that's normal or what, but that's what I got. Pepperoni and Sausage - the dough is fantastic. And for a slice (which at most places would be a pizza that sat around for awhile re-heated - though I suspect they might have just made a fresh pie for my order), the dough was fresh with the right amount of chewy. The Sausage was very likely hand made because some pieces were gigantic and others were smaller. Great flavor - I prefer sausage to be a bit more spicy, but they were generous and it was definitely flavorful and delicious. The Pepperoni as well was abundant and traditional. The whole thing smacked of top quality ingredients. And for a slice, it was like getting a whole personal pizza. It was so big I thought there was a mistake.\n\nThe Philly was very authentic. Wit wiz and it didn't come with onions or peppers - just how I like it - you can add those things, but at most places I have to request they leave them off as I'm not a fan of onions. The meat was succulent and flavorful. The bread I think was imported from Philly and you could tell the difference. I haven't had bread like that locally. I know a couple other places in the Vally import Philly bread, but this was definitely unique and very good.\n\nThe chicken \""fingers\"" was a huge portion of fried chicken. Also very good. Mac and cheese bites - they weren't the frozen triangle sort - I think they made them in house? I'm not sure. They were excellent either way. I'm waiting on the s'more. I have to digest first - I merely sampled everything, and I'm filled to the gills with tons of extra food left over. It wasn't that expensive either. I feel like i would've paid about this for half as much food at most places. \n\nDelivery was within the promised time, and the driver was super nice. \n\nAs for my visit - the inside is decked out in really cool murals. They have a definite punk rock vibe here. It's very clean and modern, but meant to look kinda divey at the same time. I liked the atmosphere. They had patches up front (like punk kids would put on their jackets back in the day) with recognizable old school punk band logos but with the restaurant's name instead. Thought that was really cool and they let me take a few home. It gave me the nostalgia feels in my guts. \n\nI met the owner as well, and he was great. We chatted for a bit about the business and about old punk rock stuff. He seemed to be very passionate about the place. That's one of the best signs a place will stay clean, do well and have good food - the owner that gives a shit. I say that in many reviews, and it's consistently true. \n\nApparently there are a handful of other locations in another State, but this is the first one in Arizona. I really hope more pop up here - I think that's the plan. This is a very welcome addition to the local pizza scene. I am now a future regular here. \n\nAnd by the way - after reading some of the ridiculous orange head one star reviews for this place, I'm pretty convinced they are angry Pizza Hut or Domino's employees or something wondering where all their orders went (I thought yelp was supposed to filter out fakes). Mill Avenue Pizza game is strong right now with this and a handful of other great local joints. This place is totally legit, and top notch. Shop local - eat local. :)"
1507	0	a	"I have worked across the street at a bar for almost a year. This place opened and was convenient and the food was really good. However they take forever to get you anthing. Their service is horrible.  I have ordered for delivery twice now and it has taken well over an hour for one pizza. I live ten minutes from the place. Every time I call to see where it is at they say it has just left... I told the girl who answered you said that 25 minutes ago... she said \""well it will get there\"". Not professional and won't order again."
1508	0	a	Went here for the first time today, never again. Bought the veggie Stromboli and it is by far the worst meal I have had. Overpriced, excessive wait time (took 40 min for my order) and horrible food. The Stromboli was greasy and weirdly soggy. The dough has no flavor whatsoever and after 40 min I was served undercooked dough. Ended up throwing the Stromboli away because it was not even close to edible. After spending $10 on lunch, hungry was the last thing I expected to feel. Avoid this place if you want good food. I would give this place negative stars if I could. My friend ended up throwing his second slice of pizza as well.
1509	0	a	I think this is either the first or second time I have left a review for somebody but I felt I really needed to make the effort.  We were having to stay a few nights in Scottsdale and after a real tough day decided to just go to our hotel room and order a pizza.  I was able to order online and they gave us a delivery time.  A few minutes later that time was changed to an additional half hour but we excepted it.  We ordered the Supreme pizza which I think is the most expensive one on the menu and then were charge a delivery fee plus had to pay the gratuity online with a suggested 15%.  This made this the most expensive pizza either of us had ever ordered.  We were alright with that because we were hungry and tired and just wanted good food delivered.   This ended up being the the most expensive and worst pizza we had ever had.  We both agreed that a dollar microwavable pizza would have been better.  We threw out over half of the pizza because there was hardly any toppings on it and it was hard.  While eating it my tooth started to hurt and the next day I noticed I had actually broken the tooth on the pizza, which happened to be attached to a bridge so will eventually cost be lots of money.  We will continue to tell everybody we know in the Phoenix area to stay away.
1510	0	a	I LOVE pizza, and was looking forward to picking up a pie last night.  I'm sadly on a carb restricted diet, so I save up my calories for weekly treats like this, and this fell way short.  \n\nThe pizza was undercooked, the sauce was way to sweet, and the cheese only covered half the pizza.  I would say that Gus's Pizza in Tempe is comparable, or probably actually better, but Spinelli's prices were about twice as high. I don't mind paying for good pizza (Cibo, Joe's NY Pizza, Ciao Grazie, Il Bosco, etc.) but this pizza just made me sad and angry.\n\nTaking a look at the reviews it looks like an even mix between customers that shared my experience, and fake reviews from people that clearly must be friends of employees here.
1511	0	a	Went here on a Friday night, and it was busy. Not a big deal, it's Mill Ave on a Friday night. Everywhere is busy. It's a college town. My friends and I sat down, and waited 15 minutes for service. The only reason the server finally came over, is because we got another employee to bring someone over. I had gone up to the bar and asked if I could order food there, and was told no. Only for takeout. Well, that guy lied to me because I saw several people going up there and getting pizza slices and bringing them back to their tables. \n\nI ordered two beers since they were having specials, and was asked for my ID again even though I had on a wristband they made me get. Okay, fine. Then when I go back to get two more beers, I'm told I can only get one at a time. I said I just got two, and they try to tell me the liquor law states that I can only get one at a time. ANOTHER LIE. Seriously. You really expect every single person in the party to go up separately to get drinks when it's that busy? I just wanted two beers. I've been to bars all over Phoenix and nobody else has ever pulled that crap. \n\nThen we finally get to order, and it takes OVER AN HOUR for us to get some pizza slices. We were pissed. Then, on top of the wait time, the pizza was HORRIBLE. I've eaten at so many different pizza places in the Valley, and I swear to god even Pizza Hut has better pizza than this place. You can't even use being busy as an excuse for the pizza slices taking so long. All we had was cheese, and I have been to Venezia's Pizzeria in Tempe hundreds of times, and even on a super busy Friday night, I have never waited more than 10 minutes for my order when dining in. No excuses. \n\nServers/bartenders were rude, food was terrible, and the atmosphere is pretty douche-y/pretentious. I will never waste my money here ever again. Your business won't last long if you keep this crap up. You need servers that know how to handle several tables at once and can keep things organized. Seriously... I know this wasn't your first Friday night on Mill Ave. I have no idea how you don't have your crap together.
1512	0	a	Terrible customer service, you have to wait for the bartenders at least 10 minutes. And they are pretty rude and condescending
1513	1	a	Super friendly staff. Very happy to explain dishes and sauces to those that aren't familiar with Vietnamese food...or if you were too intimated to at other places. \n\nI had the lemongrass spicy beef cold noodles. Very yummy.\nMy partner had the oxtail pho, and she said the oxtail was very meaty and tastes like beef (and not fat).\n\nWe also shared a stir fried rice noodle with beef, and we couldn't stop shoveling it in our mouths fast enough. The fried springrolls  were OK (only gave us a couple lettuce leaves and mint, but were very happy to bring us cilantro & basil when we asked). \n\nThe Vietnamese iced coffee was nice and strong, just like it's supposed to be.  We will definitely be back, especially since it is so close to home.
1514	0	a	I don't know how this place got high reviews. Awful service, food was bad. We ordered Pho and Hu Tieu and the broth was plain full of MSG. They forgot to bring out chopsticks and we had to call them ourselves. They did not give us napkins even though we asked many times. The girl whom I thought was the manager was screaming in the kitchen and gave us bad attitudes. Will never ever ever come back again. Even Taco Bell's and McDonald's would be much better. Money wasted!
1515	0	a	I want to be nice and give this place two stars, but it was just terrible. This is a brand new vietnamese restaurant. For starters, you walk into this restaurant and everything seems to look okay, but then you sit down and there's overwhelming smell coming from the table, my guess is this place cleans their tables with dirty rags. The waiter then comes over with the menu and asks if we would like anything to drink, they don't have that many options for drinks......we then look at the menu and omg half if it is crossed out with a sharpie. This brand new restaurant already doesn't serve half the stuff on their menu. We decided to order egg rolls, pho, and a rice dish. We sat there as our food comes out and they never brought us serving plates, napkins, utensils or anything, how do they expect us to eat? The eggs rolls were confusing huge when they came out and on the first bite, it was like chinese style, with lots of veggies and no meat. When I go to a vietnamese restaurant, I would at least like to eat vietnamese egg rolls. Then the pho comes out (they charged $3 for 2 tiny pieces of ox tail) and visually, I thought the food was getting better, but then we had our first taste and the booth was awful, it tasted like water.....after drowning my bowl in hoisin sauce, it still had no taste. My rice dish with pork chops and egg custard didn't look too bad, but the most important part of a rice dish is the rice and it was the worst rice I have ever tasted. The pork chop were not too bad, but how am I supposed to enjoy it when the rice tasted awful. Now the egg custard, was not even made the right way. The top is supposed to have an orange color to it, and it was colorless here. Egg custard is supposed to have wonderful flavors to it, but here, it was completely bland. The workers also made the experience worst. They didn't seem to meet customers' needs. There was also one specific worker sitting at the able next to us coughing vigorously while we were eating and it sure made me lose my appetite. This place was just awful, and the only excuse they have right now, is that they are new. They have some serious changes that need to be made if they want to be successful. Workers need to put customers first and know what their needs are, the food variety needs to stop getting smaller because crossing out items does not help their business, the food quality and taste most definitely needs to improve and I'd start by learning how authentic vietnamese food should be prepared, and overall, this place needs to be improved. You guys are a new business and this is your perfect chance to improve it while it's still new. I'll be back in a few months and I hope I'll have better things to say.
1516	0	a	So I was happy a pho spot open up on the east side. . So before I take my wife there I tried it by myself and ordered the pho house special. So it comes out and theres ox tail in the pho , i thought whoa that's coo but as i dug deeper with my spoon because i had to wait for chopsticks that the black server forgot to give me . I counted 4 beef flanks, 1 tripe , 1 tendon and 2 ox tail bones and thought wow how cheap is that bowl of pho, they must be Chinese ...The broth tasted like water and sugar and noodles were so bland and not even cooked ....so as I'm struggling to eat this unknown bowl of pho, I'm about 2 minutes into it. The black server drops the check in front of me . Didn't even ask if I was happy with the food or not. I see the bill is freaking 13 dollars for one bowl of pho. I totally flip like wtf it's not worth no fukin 13 dollars for this crap. I go to complain like no its not 13 it's 8.50.. The server shows me on the menu another house special pho that says with oxtail . Wow now I totally feel gouged by him, I told him to get the owners or mangers  and they all hid from me ..I also told the server to send back that bowl of pho and get me the pho I ordered ... He looked at me and told me I had to pay for that bowl of pho first. Never in my life has a place ever made me pay for Un satisfaction in which I didn't even eat the pho . As I'm writing this review I'm thinking I should have just walked out  but I did pay for the pho fukin 13 dollars for that crap and they knew I didn't even eat it. They let me walk out pissed and angry and hungary shows who these people really are.  There not here to give good quality food but here to take your money. Please do not go here, I will be calling the health department on them every month because I'm out to put these people under. Really people , pho T do yourself a favor and close your doors now you'll save more money that way u fukin amateurs. All over one bowl of pho wtf.. Also shame on all of you that gave this place a good rating.
1517	0	a	Egg rolls delish, pho not so much. Pho was sweet with a flowery flavor. Ordered the egg rolls first, then pho and buhn. Egg rolls came out last. Would not go back except for egg rolls and the service. Very attentive service and really nice.
1518	0	a	Weak broth in the pho; it was like water. \nDecent bun, but small portions.\nServers confused and inefficient\nBill unceremoniously tossed on our table halfway through the meal, ensuring we ordered nothing else.\nWaiter pressed the pitcher up against the glasses while refilling the waters, ensuring that everyone in the place shared each other's germs.\n\nGuess I'm going back to my old places.
1519	1	a	I'm very happy there is a pho place on this side of town,  and this place is great!  The only down side is they only have 1 size pho. It's a family owned family operated restaurant and the food is great. I'll be going back often
1520	0	a	This pho restaurant is ok.
1521	0	a	So far 3 visits, one take-out experience. Pho Ga (Chicken) not on menu, but accommodated when requested. Portions small, and food $1-2 more expansive than most. Good spring roll, not worth stir-fry flat noodle, pho so-so. Service need a lot of training, like remembering to provide utensils at table or in takeouts. The place has no competition 4 mi. radius. It may either succeed or go out of business is next two years or less if they don't improve their business method. Good luck.
1522	0	a	"I was so disappointed when I had my favorite \""salads rolls\"" and the sauce came out tasting like snot! Very friendly though."
1523	0	a	Seems like a family run business which is like most pho restaurants. The young boy who seated and served us had no character. Almost robot like. His older sister who came in later actually seemed like she knew what she was doing. But all of my reviews on Asian restaurants are never based on customer service. \n\nSo, as far as the food goes, there were barely any pieces of steak and tendon and my broth tasted almost black licorice like. Price wise it was average about $8 for a small bowl. The Vietnamese iced coffee was good but can't really mess up on that too much. I was hoping for a home run with this place since its so close to my house but I was sorely disappointed. Guess I gotta keep trekking across town to find the perfect pho.
1524	1	a	My friends and I took our kids to Sunday brunch.  The restaurant has lots of TVs, games and a kids corner.  The kids had fun playing ski ball and playing in the little kids corner.  The service was great and staff was friendly.  All of our food was delicious.  Definitely a great spot to catch the game!
1525	1	a	We had a great experience at this new restaurant. Located in the up-and-coming Foote Addition Neighborhood of Central Phoenix, the food was way better than we expected.  We started with the Wild Boar Sliders and the Steak and Fontina Quesadillas.  Both were excellent. I ordered the Rabbit Sloppy Joe and my husband ordered the Bison Beef and Bacon Burger. I was surprised at how good both were. Portions were large and prices very reasonable. The front glass windows open for cooler nights and there are plenty of TVs to watch the various sports games playing. They also had a good happy hour menu. Parking is in the back. Overall, very impressed and we will definitely be back.
1526	0	a	"Sunday 11am. \n\nMy husband and I walked into the \""sports grill\"" for Football Sunday, noticed the empty bar and attempted to take a seat. The lovely bartender tells us \""the steeler game is over there\"" and points to a corner in the room. There were two people seated at a 20 top bar and you're turning us away?? The three tv's over the bar were all tuned to the same game. OK. \n\nWe sat at in the corner we were directed after the hostess, who turned out to be our server, provided some off the mark excuse about why they can't change the tv's. Listen guys, I get the tv thing, but when your establishment is empty, you may want to consider bending the rules. Our server advised us that the lunch menu was beginning at 11 and their 9 item brunch menu until 12. As soon as I decide on my food choice, she rushes over to say we can't order lunch... At 11... I felt forced to order the breakfast burrito since 2 of the options included hot/cold cereal... Really? I have that at home. No lie. I really do. \n\nSo after what seems to be a lifetime... I had to use the restroom. When I came back, apparently the manager had stopped by apologizing for the lunch menu not being available to us... Well me. He bought our meal before it arrived. Our food arrived and it looked gross. Tortilla barely cooked, eggs were rubbery and salsa was bland. Even though I was starving, I still only ate half. Now, the best part... While I finished my half of burrito, at 1145, the obnoxiously drunk table we were forced to sit next too got their food. Guess what they got?!? LUNCH!! Not just lunch, blt's. The specific menu item I wanted, yet denied. Also, I wasn't offered another cocktail until I was finished eating. \n\nI don't get the five star reviews. The food was not good. If it was taken care of already, I would have sent it back. Service was slow and the bartender was rude. \n \nMaybe in six months I'll consider returning.... IF they are are open."
1527	1	a	Welcome to the neighborhood! Just on the outskirts of Arcadia, but is as urban and modern as they come! This is my go-to spot for ice cold beer on tap, football, and to get my wings on with their Honey Hot bbq sauce! The best on the planet! \n\nIf you're looking for a cool sports bar, with a hot visual aid--that be Madison working the bar, and the owner (Ryan) making his rounds to make sure that his guests are satisfied, then you can't go wrong here! \n\nOh, and they have USB ports to charge your phone at the bar, and at some of the booths! AWESOME!\n\nIf you're up to trying different food, like Buffalo and wild boar, then you want to give it a go here! They have wild boar and buffalo!
1528	0	a	Tonight was my second visit and last. I don't like to bad mouth local businesses, but I have a big problem with this place. First off, if you look on their website they advertise that they show every Pac-12 and Big 10 football game. That's funny, because tonight when I went in they didn't have on Stanford vs Utah or Michigan State vs Maryland. What's even worse, they didn't even have on Notre Dame, who by the way was playing a Big 10 team or Auburn vs Georgia (two teams ranked in the top 15). That's Notre Dame football and the ESPN SEC Saturday night football game and I have to ask to put them both on? Think about that. I had to ask the manager to put on ESPN for me. At sports bar or grill whatever you want to call it....Are you kidding me? That's just bad.\n\nMore so there wasn't sound from the games - instead they play cheesy music like Bon Jovi (Bad Medicine nonetheless) and Tom Petty - songs you've heard a million times before. I came in to watch football - not listen to cheese! Speaking of sound - On my first visit - the owner felt the need to have the the Cowboys vs Giants game with sound on the big screen instead of the Cardinals game. Mind you, that's the first place Arizona Cardinals were are talking about! The local team - hello??? Not cool. \n\nFood is totally hit or miss. The servers are friendly and there aren't enough televisions either. Lots of unused wall space and TV's could be bigger. Hard to see more than one TV at once. Yes, they have nice bathrooms and a children's corner, but that's about the best things regarding the interior. Get it together or you'll be going out-of-business. On this second visit, the place was dead on a Saturday night at dinner time.
1529	1	a	Checked this place out at the recommendation of a friend and I wasn't disappointed. The menu has some fun big game items like wild boar and pork carnitas street tacos, rabbit sloppy joe, and so much more.  For those of you with a sweet tooth try the cronut desert.  They offer a weekend brunch from 9-12 and a reverse happy hour that starts at ten.  If you want a flavorful spicy addition to your meal try the habanero hot sauce. \nThis is also a great place to catch a ball game or to hang out with friends while enjoying drinks and the fun of wild game without having the work of the hunt.
1530	0	a	This place was fun until one of the owners took out the skee ball machine because our group kept winning the $.50 beers all night long. Thanks and won't be going to this bar again.
1531	0	a	I entered the facility with my 6 mo old pup and she desperately wanted to leave.  There was no one there to greet us.  I waited several minutes in the lobby, no one.  I decided to go to the back and still couldn't find a staff person.  I was horrified to see that a dog was on the treadmill unsupervised!  All of the other dogs were in kennels.  I went next door to the office and there was the trainer hanging out.  I expressed my concern about the unsupervised dog on the treadmill and the trainer and the office person dismissed my concern.  It is a cold, unwelcoming place similar to the pound.  No way would I leave my precious girl there.  I envisioned a place where dogs could play and socialize and get some training as well.  Boy was I wrong.
1532	1	a	I have eaten every type of food they offer from salads to pizza and hoagies.  I have ordered more times than i can count and look forward to my next order. This is my favorite place to order from downtown and I recommend it to and guests at my work looking for best local pizza place. I have never had a bad experience from this place and the food tastes very good and homemade. They even make their own salad dressings. I Recommend to everyone!!!
1533	0	a	Horrible!!!\n\nWent through two managers before anything began. I should have known at that point not to use them. They promised to have my small bathroom tiled in a couple of hours. It's now been 6 days, and they have not finished. I am a teacher and have had to take two and a half days off to meet with them. They promised they would be here today. Again, no show!  I have to wait to have tile installed before carpet is installed. Will have to take another day off to do that. \nThey laid tile up to the baseboard rather than removing baseboard. I didn't catch this until it was too late. When I called them on it, I was told most people like it that way and that it was an extra charge. Really? Most people like shoddy workmanship to save a couple of bucks? I don't think so. \nThey left all kinds of garbage. Didn't clean up anything or replace the toilet they removed. I am beyond disgusted!  I will now have to hire someone else to complete the work. \nNever, ever hire this company unless you are a gluten for punishment!\n\nVery unhappy customer
1534	0	a	Would give no stars based upon the service we received.  It was absolutely the worst service I've had.  Ignored, had to ask for service at bar after very long wait.  Ordered wine, appetizers, and entrees.  All food came at once.  What good restaurant does that?  Food not hot.  No wine, had to ask for it after food arrived.  Asked for salt and never brought it.  No return to see if food was OK or needed anything.  Very very disappointing for a brand new place with what should be good food and atmosphere.  Food was poorly tarnished by the service.  Such a shame.
1535	0	a	Went there tonight was greeted promptly and got drinks, waited 15 minutes then got up went to the bar ans asked if we could have our order taken. The server finally came over took our order 2 appteizers and two dinners and a glass of rose. Our dinner cam 10 minutes later all of it came together. We had to ask for the wine he finally brought it asked for salt he never brought it I went to the bar to get them. Our server never came back to ask if everything was ok. I am in the restaurant business I understand things happen but this is some of the worst service I think I ever had. I don't think we will be back and not recommend it. I so wanted to like it.
1536	0	a	The brisket was quite good but too fatty. The french fries were alright but there wasn't enough ketchup. The service was slow and somewhat inattentive. There was no ambience in this restaurant. There was no music or mood lighting. FOXNews was on TV and it was just kind of dull. Overall I can say I won't be back.
1537	1	a	Went for dinner last evening. This is wonderful restaurant. They have been open about 4 week. The service was excellent, atmosphere was excellent, can't beat the prices and most important the food was outstanding!  We drove from Surprise and will definitely go back frequently. Was well worth the 35 mile each way drive. If you fancy Calamari you will be in AWE of this dish. And a very generous serving, shared by 4. I had the Pork Belly tacos for my entree, superb!  Others had shrimp poorboy, and pork roast sandwich. Everyone loved their food. Not one complaint. Give it a try, you will not be disappointed.
1538	1	a	Gave them a second chance.  A complete 180 degree difference. Came in on Saturday evening and it was very busy again, but the service was outstanding as was the food.  I observed others diners around us also getting great service.  They definitely made changes.  The food was great also.  Had the deviled eggs again and they were still great.  The pork belly tacos were fantastic as was the pot sticker posole.  I wanted to lick the bowl.  There was a filet mignon special on the menu tonight.  I want to try everything on the menu now.  It is so nice having a great restaurant like this in downtown Glendale so close to home.  Will be back again and agaiin.  Thanks Tom Harvey for opening this restaurant and the great service.
1539	1	a	Getting caught up on my reviews!!!\n\nMet up here with a dear friend recently.  It is a really cute place and I am so glad they have decided to invest in downtown Glendale.  We went during the week, around 5 PM, for catch-up and some beverages.  The menu is small and we ordered a burrata and some deviled eggs.  My friend had wine and I had some cocktails which were lovely.  We met the chef, who shared some of his ideas with us.  The meal itself was enjoyable all around.  \n\nI DO have a suggestion though:  our hostess was not very involved during our time there.  It's SO important to engage first-time customers; familiarity with the menu and the ability to make recommendations when asked are the way to create return business.  Ours was virtually non-existent and couldn't answer the most basic questions.  You may want to revisit her training as you build your clientele.\n\nBest of luck to you, Cuff!
1540	1	a	Had first dining experience here last night while we watched Glendale Glitters light up. Very impressed with the food. Especially the deviled eggs and calamari. Very flavorful. Also tried the beef brisket which was also packed with flavor. We were at table up front near window which was perfect to watch festivities. Definitely recommend!
1541	1	a	Awesome, awesome food. It's so nice to have a great restaurant in downtown Glendale that is reasonably priced and delicious!! Check out happy hour, we plan on being regulars!!
1542	0	a	We sat at the bar and I had the shrimp and grits, my friend had the eggplant parmesan sandwich .. both were good.  Beer and wine list is limited, but has some good selections.  The wait staff and customer service needs improvement.  They weren't busy and it took forever (after motioning them several times) to order a round of drinks, food, and water (typically customary).  It took them 15 minutes (I actually timed it) to ask us if we wanted some more water or drinks (they were visibly empty and we tried to get their attention multiple times).  We closed our tab, paid, signed the check and several minutes later the bartender alerted me that they mis-ran the check and forgot to add one of the beers.  Now, I eat out a lot .. any decent restaurant would have just not said anything or would have not requested additional payment for a $5 beer after the customer closed a $50 tab.  They re-ran the check and made me re-pay/sign for it .. and then it got billed twice to me.  Normally I would have just tipped the bartender the different in amount (but she was too dull to process that concept).  Amusingly, our food was rung through a second time and came out again.  Also, a reasonable restaurant would have maybe offered to box it up for us as it was their mistake -- nope, they continued to act totally clueless and probably just threw it in the trash.\n\nThis place has a cool atmosphere and could be really good if they get their customer service act together.  The chef/owner was clueless and didn't even walk over and apologize -- rude.
1543	1	a	Had a great experience here! Waiter was perfect; knowledgeable and there when needed, but not clingy. Food was really excellent; especially the brisket. Lots of delicious flavor. Solid homemade chocolate cake was a delicious ending.
1544	1	a	Yummy food, great service, highly recommend!\n\nOrdered for pick up food for 8 people and they got it all right with a good price too.\n\nHighly recommend the enchilada combo!
1545	1	a	Great service, fresh ingredients, food made to order and correct. Wonderful staff. We are from Napoleon, MI visiting family and everyone was very pleased with their meals.\nHighly recommend for an affordable, yummy meal.
1546	1	a	Armando is amazing! I pulled my neck muscle the first time I went in to see him. He magically soothed out my pain & made me very relax. It is crazy what a great massage can do to your body. I'm going back to him routinely for my monthly fix! He also accommodated to my request needing the day of appointment!
1547	1	a	Was really impressed with the massage from Armando! I've tried out a few different masseurs that I've found on yelp or groupon and so far this has been the best one. I got a 60 min massage at the yelp deal for $45 which made my wallet happy :) In all, I will be back. I work 12+ hours plus on my feet so it's nice to have a place to go to get some very much needed muscle tension relief. Oh and the heated massage table was awesome!! Def worth a try!
1548	0	a	I did not like this place at all. My husband & daughter also didn't like it. It's flavorless. It's like half assed American Mexican food at Salsarita's or QDoba prices. Trust me, just go to a QDoba.
1549	0	a	I am not impressed with this Moe's restaurant!! There was old food dripped around the edges of the food bar, and I saw the employees push the old food back into the fresh food instead of cleaning it up and throwing it away. The salsa bar is also never full and rarely clean. The management needs to get a handle on this restaurant! I understand it is fairly new, but the employees and managers really could do a better job maintaining cleanliness. I live in fort mill and I pass by this Moe's to go to the Rock Hill location because the food is fresher and the staff is more organized and friendlier. I was really excited for the Fort Mill Moe's to open, but I do not want to spend anymore money there until the service picks up. They're are a lot of great Mexican restaurants in Fort Mill and Moe's has a lot to compete with. I love Moe's so I really hope this location steps their game up!
1550	1	a	Randy is extremely kind, patient and honest.  He did everything he said he would and didn't try throwing in some extra fees at the end that were not previously discussed.  He cleaned our floors wonderfully and I would absolutely recommend him to friends and family!
1551	0	a	We ordered from this place off of grubhub. Although their delivery was done in a very timely manner they didn't put much effort in their food. The rolled tacos were hard and chewy instead of crunchy & apparently CHEESE cost a lot of money because in my Super Nachos order they forgot it. There was literally 25% of what there should've been not to mention it looked like a 3yr old put the order together. The cheese was also lacking in my boyfriends quesadilla. I would've ordered extra cheese right off the bat but they change an extra $3.00 just for that. So make sure you look at your order before you get it delivered or picked up.
1552	0	a	Well we ordered off of paypal sounded fun and new so we tried it. When I ordered I was given a time of completion. That time was 35 minutes.  So when I picked up at that time. My food was cold. The person that brought it to me said he didn't think I was coming. It had been ready for a long time. Needless to say by the time I got it home it was very cold. So cold that my cheese was not stringy and was just stuck there. The guacamole was just brown and black pieces of cut up avocado. That was on our fries, burritos, and the rolled tacos. (Please refer to the pictures I posted ) I ordered an extra side of pico de gallo @ $3.00 a side. I received a cup full of liquid salsa. Not the typical Freash chopped  tamatoes, onions jalape\u00f1os and cilantro. Very disappointing because I ordered an side of $3 chips to eat with the fresh version of pico. Then I asked for extra green salsa. I was told there was plenty in there for me I wouldn't need any more. Mind you I ordered 4 California burritos, 2 Carne asda fries, 3 rolled tacos, a $3 side of beans, and a $3 side of rice. I was feeding 7 people.  So yes I did need more and we did run out. $60 bucks wasted on garbage.  Over priced for the quality of the food!!!! WON'T BE DINING HERE AGAIN! Even though the paypal part was great. The food and services was awful.
1553	0	a	Guys there's nothing to see or do here in the winter right now, heads up. It's just some wooden rocking chairs and a wooden carousel mouldering under the snow near the market. Looking forward to seeing what they do with this space come spring 2015!
1554	0	a	"Wow, generally speaking, this is probably one of the most crooked places I've been to in Vegas! Please note, do not buy the Groupon here, you will get hoodwinked!! I've never had so much trouble using one until I came to this spot.\n\nFirst, I would like to say that the employees are not at fault for the confusion, I think the owner of this location is the main culprit in the poor customer service. They are creating ridiculous rules for their customers. So the groupon is for 5 for 10. On my first visit, the tall guy wouldn't add tax into the total price of the meal. I was like \""fine\"". I was able to macguyver my ordering until the total before tax was 9.98. They guy was like \""our minimum is 10 dollars before you can use it\"" I was thinking \""what a great way to nickel and dime your customers\""! The tall guy was rude and confrontational to a customer in front of me.\n\n\nThe next day, I came back to use up the groupon and fortunately the tall guy wasn't working at that time. I wasn't impressed with the food during the last visit, so just decided to order sides and dessert. I was then told that I could not use the groupon because it was not a \""food item\""....\n...\n.......\n..............\n\nSo ice cream and sides aren't food? Apparently not I guess. He then told me the groupon is available only for the numbered items, 1-14, on the menu, no sides, drinks, salads or anything else..\n\nI was about to bust out my Cris Carter, \""Cmon man!\""\nThe shorter guy with glasses proceeded to apologize saying those are the rules set by the management there. I understood.\n\nFood wise, there is nothing to talk about here, everything is mediocre. Very bland and disappointing. I do have to say the Rose tea was really good.\n\nI've done the math here. Mediocre food + shady, non-customer oriented iron handed management with a concern only with a bottom line = 2 stars!! And I thought I was being generous. In the words of Terminus \""Never again\""."
1555	1	a	Food is full of flavor. I am in love with this spot. You can tell they cooked the food with love despite it being fast food. I will definitely be revisiting this spot when i'm in this area!!!
1556	1	a	Very helpful staff, food prepared after ordering, very flavorful. Would highly recommend!
1557	0	a	"They have specials listed on a whiteboard when you enter the restaurant. I ordered the gyro and asked to have feta on it, they said they couldn't put feta on the sandwich but could give me a side for 1.99. I thought that was a little odd but blew it off and decided against it. I grabbed a can of soda that came with the meal and sat down. The place was clean and looked well maintained, even had a nice smell inside. The food came quickly and the server was friendly. The special, which was listed as \""gyro, fries, and a can of soda\"" was actually an over sized pita bread cut in half with very little filling. The little meat that was there didn't have much flavor so you basically just get a lot of pita bread and little else. The fries ended up being the highlight because they had an ok seasoning on them but there were very few of them in the little paper tray they came served in. It was not an expensive meal, but I guess you get what you pay for. I think this place does a disservice to its customers by not listing what you actually get when you order. No one likes being misled by ordering a gyro and receiving half of one, even if it is in an over sized pita."
1558	1	a	"New favorite place! The food is so good I could have hurt myself eating it, gorging until my stomach exploded or I suffered multiple foodgasms, whichever came first. \n\nThe man behind the counter was super sweet, patiently explaining everything to us newbies (I didn't have the heart to explain that I have had Persian before. My husband was really into it so I just let them chat.) Prices are on par, portions generous. I watched them prepare it. All is clean and above board. Fresh, on-the-spot. Did not see any of the issues that the other yelpers, who I am assuming are rival restaurateurs, saw.\n\nIt is very very flavorful with lots of sauces and anything extra that you could ask for, including an amazing green sauce that I could drink. So, Mr. Thought-it-was-too-bland needs to quit smoking.\n\nAs for the people who are incapable of reading the menu or their Groupon conditions (and every Groupon has insane conditions, they must, Groupon goes out of their way to screw the small business owner and while Groupon rakes in the dough, these struggling businesses actually lose money on people like you), I don't think the restaurant should have to suffer for your illiteracy. Go back to school, learn how to spell words like \""its\"", then use your new skills to read the small print, then and only then write Yelp reviews.\n\nOk, back to the food: Can't wait to try everything on the menu. Organic, healthy, tasty, yum."
1559	0	a	Absolutely ridiculous.  I love Gyros and this place opened close to home - I was stoked!  Finally got a chance to try it out and went in to order a Gyro.  I walked to the register and said I will take a Gyro sandwich.  I was told that I couldn't buy just a sandwich unless I had a coupon (????).  I was confused and asked what do you mean - I just want a sandwich.  He preceded to tell me that I could not order just a sandwich.  I informed him that I didn't want the other stuff and I would just throw them away and I got a deer in the headlights look so I asked for the owners phone number.\n\nI called the owner and he informed me of the same policy.  It reminded me of the Jack Nicholson Five Easy Pieces schtick about holding the chicken  \n\nNeedless to say, I ended up buying a Gyro sandwich (only) at Kyklos at the mall.
1560	1	a	This is a great space with great people and most importantly, an excellent coach. Barrett bring years of experience as an athlete and coach to CFBD, and it is evident in his great instruction and support. I highly recommend checking CFBD out!
1561	1	a	Love this place!  The owner (Barrett) is very nice and really knowledgable.  He does a great job teaching the right form on all of the exercises he uses.  The workouts are great and maybe best of all they are alway different each day!!
1562	1	a	Corey most certainly went the extra mile to make a sale for us on this house. He worked open houses, cooperated with other realtors, kept things moving and advised us with the offers that came in. He gets an A+ from us and we would most certainly employ him again.\nRichard and Nancy DeBusman
1563	0	a	"Good beer. Nice facility. Service is substandard at best. It took our waitress 40 minutes to greet our table...40! I timed it. And no one came over to clean our table from the previous guests...we cleaned it ourselves.  A 1/3 of the menu had big \""X's\"" on the menu items that were not available....weird??? Not impressed with the service at all. We actually left to go eat somewhere else. It's very loud inside too. Makes it hard to have a conversation. Hopefully these are just growing pains in their new location. But they better step it up or they'll be out of business."
1564	0	a	I had HIGH hopes for OMB in its new location. I've enjoyed coming to OMB to participate in Yoga on Tap and always enjoyed the atmosphere and vibe at the old location. However, I visited the new location over Labor Day weekend and didn't experience the same treatment as I did at the old location. The layout is beautiful, the bathrooms are clean, the grass is green, but the service is TERRIBLE. \n\nI was sitting inside with about 6 other people. It took 15 minutes to get someone even to notice that we were sitting there (the place wasn't even that crowded). After asking 3 people if could get some help, a very pleasant woman came by and helped us. We all ordered flights (4 smaller beers that give you the opportunity to taste a variety). When the beers finally arrived a different server brought them....totally fine, but she didn't know who ordered what and she didn't even know what beers were in each flight. So none of us even got what we had ordered. Then we ordered food and all of our orders were wrong. I was very disappointed and a little embarassed since I brought friends there from out of town. \n\nMy advice to you --- save yourself some time and head over to Triple C, NoDa Brewery or any other lovely brewery Charlotte has to offer. I'll give OMB a few months to smooth out those kinks before returning back.
1565	1	a	I planned a couple's Stock the Bar shower here with a friend of mine and overall we think the event was a success! Thanks to their beautiful new space, delicious brews, and brewery tour, the guests had a pretty good time! Really, REALLY love their new space! They did an amazing job.\n\nThe food that we ordered ended up being just right even though we were a little worried about the menu they provided for us to choose from for our party. The Chef came out to deliver some of the items and I always think it's a great touch when the Chef comes to check on you. \n\nOne star was knocked off for service. Although the servers were really nice and Gina the manager, was phenomenal, seriously, VERY accommodating... they kept switching servers on us- like 3 times and for a party of 18-20 it was very confusing for our guests. Had we had 3 servers helping us the whole time it would have been one thing, but we had one server for an hour, then another server, than another at the end. I chalk this up to them just getting accustom to the new space though. I am sure there are some growing pains that have gotten or will get worked out.  \n\nAlthough we didn't need to use it because our party was more casual and smaller, their event space seems awesome for an event too! Highly recommend looking into it if you're planning an event!
1566	0	a	"Tremendous new space and tremendous intentions do not translate into a tremendous experience.\n\nBackground: Been drinking craft beer since the late 80s rebirth, OMB from the outset of its founding. Still have an original growler somewhere. Yet this new brauhaus -- roughly down the street from the old -- has to go in the disappointment checkbox. And for the oddest of reasons.\n\nIt seems someone has elevated a parody of Teutonic aloofness and detachment to the new OMB standard. How else to explain menus, walls, anything devoid of info on the beers? The single POS station for a huge space? The frazzled servers just trying to make do rather than make good? Just not a good vibe.\n\nIt starts with staffing. If you are gonna have table service inside a space of this size you need a minimum of four waiters and four bussers/runners -- great that you have a guy floating around to \""explain\"" the beers, but if you'd PRINT THAT info somewhere (and it looked like there was as empty space in the menus where that shoulda been on the Sunday afternoon we visited) then you can stick him back behind the bar.\n\nStress on the wait staff was evident from the dropped orders (my German potato salad I was really looking forward to got morphed into the house-made potato CHIPS, which are awesome and evil, but still) and the lost beer refill sales.\n\nAnd the beer. Look, I love fresh, local craft beer. But. Somewhere along the way OMB has decided to up the malt and cut the hops. The beers are almost universally too sweet and flat -- at least this batch. The Mecktoberfest remains a decent take on the style, but maybe the move has jarred the output. Either that or stale kegs are not getting dumped in time -- dunno the exact deal, but overall the beer was only meh to good when it should be outstanding across the board.\n\nWhat was outstanding? The German fare on the menu. Shockingly so. A brat that was actually cooked properly -- a little char, firm and rendered thru to the middle; not burnt and raw -- and crazy pretzel parts. Do start with a pretzel app ($3.50) to nosh, but skip the beer cheese add-on ($5.25) which was universally judged less interesting than the mustard, and save almost $2. The pretzel melt was high at $10 (Black forest ham, Swiss cheese & spicy mustard served in between a soft pretzel) but damn good. In retrospect, order a pretzel and two of the melts and a party of four can nosh and drink a good long, happy time.\n\nLess successful was the Southwest turkey wrap ($9) primarily because the smoked chili sauce was insanely hot. A mystery on our visit -- all the wing options were X-ed out. Fine. But the takeaway remains -- go German on the munchies.\n\nThis space remains tremendously popular, even if I do not quite know why. Might be sustainable for a long time at current quality levels. Might not. I'll give it another go in a few months regardless."
1567	1	a	This is a pretty cool place.  The patio is huge and perfect for day drinking/spending a cool evening. They do not have a huge selection of beers, but I like several of the ones they offer. They serve food as well. It is standard pub fair but does the trick. The facility is brand new and very great atmosphere. The service is excellent. I will be back :)
1568	0	a	A group of friends and I went here two weekends ago. Since it was a beautiful Saturday, we wanted to sit outside while enjoying their food. Seeing as it was around 2pm, we were ready for lunch, having just come from another brewery! We had heard that they had German-style food, and we were excited. We found out that in order to have lunch from Olde Meck while outside, you had to sit on the sidewalk and not on the gravel. We waited for a table to open up, and then the 9 of us sat down at the table. \nWe were greeted promptly, and the waitress took our drink orders. She came back a little later and took our food order. Several of my friends ordered a plate where you can order two different types of sausage and two side items. After waiting a little bit, my wrap came out and my friend's burger came out. The rest of the group had ordered the different types of sausage. I hate to say this, but there was extreme confusion between the kitchen and the food runners. Unfortunetly, almost none of the sausages were on the correct plate with their correct side dishes. What was frustrating for my friends was that they didn't know what the type of sausages were supposed to look like; they just knew what they had ordered. It took a really long time, and one of my friends getting very upset with the waitress and manager, before everyone got their correct food. By then, we all just wanted to go. We ended up getting the entire meal comped, which was very nice of them, but it was still frustrating. \nMy husband likes their beer, so we may go back again to try the beer. I just wouldn't recommend the restaurant aspect of Olde Meck.
1569	1	a	Good beer, awesome outdoor area, good live music....you can't go wrong! Highly recommended.
1570	1	a	Love love love the new beir garden. Friendly staff and the best beer going. The sample plates are also amazing. Love that we can also bring the dogs, even if it is outside. Would love to see some live music even if its just a low key open mic
1571	1	a	Super impressed! What a great new venue and fun to be had by all!\n\nMy husband, pup, and I made a casual stop on a sunny Saturday afternoon. This was the place to be! There were lots of pups, families, couples, and groups of friends taking advantage of the day. \n\nThere is indoor seating with tvs and table food service. While outside, there is a little pop-up bar and food truck station (their own brand). There are about 3 corn holes set up. There is a grassy area for your pup with complimentary doggie bags. Also, if you want to bring your own picnic blanket, do so. Plenty of families were setting up blankets. As you can tell, I was very impressed by the overall atmosphere. \n\nIf you are lucky enough to bike there, they have bike racks ready for you. \n\nOrder local brew, get some tasty bites, and have a terrific time here!
1572	0	a	Lately every time we have came the inside tables all day reserved, yet there is never anyone ever sitting at the tables. Because of this we have left twice for this inconvenience of service
1573	1	a	Fantastic environment.  The bratwurst were fantastic and even you do not like sauerkraut try it;  it is out standing.   Oh and the beer superb! !
1574	0	a	I was really upset with them. A few of us got there early and grab drinks at the bar and didn't get ID at the bar. After others came in we got a table ordered more drinks and never got ID they gave us the drinks. About 20 minutes after we sat down the waiter came over and asked for IDs. After my friend noticed she didn't have hers on her she told him and her boyfriend took her drink before she touched it and drank it himself. After that we tried calling the waiter over to order food and he kept ignoring us. Then he got his manger over to check again. And at that point he was checking mine and didn't give it back right away and started to ask me where I lived. I don't care that he did this. But the fight the waiter kept walking passed us and then told us that if we didn't lie about our age it wouldn't have been a problem. At that point we all got upset and asked who was lying about age. He then told us there was someone there that had told him. When we asked to know who told him that he got his manger. When his manger came over he told us that if we wanted to stay we weren't allowed to have anymore drinks. Upon that we asked for our checks and he told them we could order food Togo. After this I don't think I'll be going back. They were very rude to my friends and me.
1575	0	a	"The sign on the building says \""Now Open\"" however I just to go in to check it out and the place is NOT OPEN! ugh. What a joke! I've also learned that they will not be having Group Fitness Classes or even Child Care. What the heck??? Is this just going to be a body building gym or what?? Every time I try to get some information out of the staff under the tent that don't seem to know whats going on! How frustrating! If your Looking for group classes like I am this place is not for you!!"
1576	0	a	I javent been to this one but the one in surprise i didnt like. One of the trainers would hit on all the girls which i feel victim to made me feel uncomfortable to workout
1577	0	a	So now that this place is open I decided to check it out. Not going to lie I was extremely let down for how long this place took to get opened up. All that waiting for just a crappy turn out! \n\nFirst off... Why wouldn't you have kids daycare or most of all even fitness classes??? I was told by Ivan the general manager that I could take classes and leave me kids at the other location ... HAVE YOU SEEN IT??!! I DON'T want to use the old location it's disgusting and I don't ever want to step foot inside it! \n\nBest advise I can give is to shop around there are a couple other gyms close by that are nicer with group classes and offer the day care for kids.
1578	0	a	What a dump! I walk in the guy working the front desk looks at me and walks around the corner. I looked around was not impressed. I'll keep driving to golds !
1579	0	a	It took over 45 minutes for the food to come out.  I ordered the chicken fried chicken.  The chicken was so rubbery and the crust was soggy.  My eggs were over done and the toast was burnt. Will never go there again for breakfast.
1580	0	a	I really wish that I could write a glowing review about Eggs and More BUT we waited in the lobby for 15 minutes to be seated (no hostess). Each of the 2 wait staff told us we will be with you in just a minute. They were taking care of a handful of customers, maybe 6-10 each. After waiting 15 minutes in a less than busy restaurant we left to go to a place that would actually seat and serve us. It will be a long time until we try this place again!!!!!
1581	0	a	If I could give ZERO stars I would. First, they don't have a kids menu. A 4 year old cannot eat an adult meal! We ordered the ultimate omelette: egg, bacon, sausage, ham, onion, peppers, tomatoes, mushrooms and cheese. The meal came with hashbrowns and toast. We ordered the omelette without peppers and tomatoes. When the waitress brought the food the omelette was no more than 1/2 inch thick. No fluffiness, dry, over cooked and they forgot the onions and mushrooms. It was horrible! The hashbrowns were cold and the toast wasn't even good. This was about 4pm on a Friday and we were the only people there besides the wait staff. We sat right across from where the waitresses bring the food from the kitchen. The owner calls all the staff to the food pick up area for what I  assuming is a staff meeting. He is talking loud enough that we hear every word he says. As he talks to them he starts telling them about how in years past he smoked pot and did cocaine. I can not believe what we are hearing, nor can I imagine any circumstance where this shod be told to the staff. If you want your employees and customers to respect you, leave your private life private. When the waitress brought our check I asked her if that man doing the talking was the boss. She said yes and started laughing. I told her the whole conversation was inappropriate, she agreed and apologized. You know what, I could care less, from what I saw and had to eat I will bet this place is closed in less than year. We will not return!
1582	0	a	First time we tried to eat here we walked out. They had wait staff walking out....A real mess! Decided to give it a go one more time. ...should have kept going.....just awful!! Crab cakes were truly awful with the crab cake benedict,  asked for eggs medium....hard as a rock. Food was Luke warm, butter wouldn't melt on my husband's pancake. No excuse for cold food...\nvery few customers.  This place won't make it if they don't straighten up. Very disappointed. ..we REALLY NEED a GOOD breakfast place on the west side.....This ain't it!!!
1583	0	a	Decided to try this breakfast place. Bad idea. We always go somewhere else but they were crowded. Walked in to eggs n more and there were about 3 groups ahead of us. The restaurant was empty but they did not seat us. After waiting about 15 minutes they sat us and it took over and hour to get our food. This place needs staff and a better manager. EXCUSES!! Horrible. Will not return.
1584	0	a	"I arrived at about 2:30 PM. As I got out of my car, I saw a male employee lock the door and run back inside the restaurant, obviously hoping that I wouldn't see him. Even though there were only two other cars in the parking lot, there were no obvious signs suggesting they were closed. I was determined to try a new mom & pop eatery, so walked to the entrance and tried opening the front door, just in case... It would not budge. No employee had the courtesy to tell me why they locked their door and they had no signs indicating why they were closed. A simple \""sorry, we were slow, so we decided to call it a day\"" would have sufficed, but I guess that's too much to ask. \nGiven the semi-obscure location of this restaurant, in a shopping center with a vacant anchor tenant, I would think they would be eager to take all the business they can get. Perhaps this attitude mirrors the service I would have received (or lack, thereof) had I been let in. I never had a chance to taste their food, so I'll have to assume that its quality reflects their poor attitude. I can't justify giving them a rating above one star. It looks like my breakfast choices in Goodyear will continue to remain north of I-10. \nI wouldn't be surprised if this place closes permanently by the end of 2014."
1585	0	a	Management is horrible, owner was sitting around watching television. It was dirty, the host had to come and get my drinks. The server was described by my kids as emotionless. The food was cold and flavorless. The silverware was dirty as well, the smell around the restaurant was filthy as well it smelled like an old sewer. I would not recommended anyone to come in here. This place is not going to last. From my understanding all of the owners previous restaurants had closed down, this ones not going to be any different so it seems. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON HERE, DO YOURSELF A FAVOR.
1586	0	a	This was the second time my mom and I went to this restaurant.  First time was grand opening and the wait and and disorganized was unbelievable. So we figured it was do to its just opening. Well we went back today to see if it had gotten any better and I will admit our wait time to be seated was an improvement but once we got a table and then it went down hill from there.  First off no one came to see if we wanted any drinks as we waited the staff seemed to even not notice us at all and went to 5 other tables of guest that came after us. At this point we got frustrated and got up and left.  So my opinion of the place is nkw we will never go back seeing there staff has no value of how to serve there guest
1587	0	a	We decided to try Eggs and more, we had a coupon but forgot to present it when we ordered, the coupon does say to present when ordering but the waitress was really nice and said that she would get the boss to override the check so she could accept it. I could not believe how rude the boss was, he came out to the table and made a scene and ruined our appetite. We will never go back and we will bad mouth this so called resturant to everyone we know. The food was terrible, the only thing that was good about this place was the waitress.
1588	0	a	Aweful service.  Tables weren't clean. Watched them touch the silverware on the top as they wrapped. Tables were left uncleared for 20 minutes at a time when there was a huge line waiting.  Waited an hour for our food. Never got it. We got up and walked out. Not happy with this place. Would never recommend it to anyone.
1589	0	a	Zero stars. Didn't eat here cause after standing by hostess station for 15 minutes, decided to leave. The waitresses saw us, but never even acknowledged us - the 6 tables they were serving must've been too much to handle as it was. There were a few other people who walked in and waited behind us. They too left. \n\nMy prediction is this place will not last unless they up their service!
1590	0	a	If I could give it less than one star, I would.\nThe place is horrible.  We stood and waited for the hostess while she was chatting.  Her pants were too small as was her top and she had to keep pulling her pants up.  I thought that I was in a strip joint, she had so much skin showing between her pants and top.\nWe finally got seated.  On a Saturday morning, there were only about 6-8 tables with people.  They were small groups of two, besides.  Anyway, when we finally got to order, we waited 35 minutes for our food to come out!  The hash browns were anemic and in a puddle of oil.  The coffee was nasty.  The food is just awful.  There is absolutely nothing that could get me to go back.
1591	0	a	I don't know where to start,  so I will just say not everybody should open up there own restaurant. They seem to have no cue what they are doing. I will give them another chance if they are still in business in a few months
1592	0	a	We decided to try this after always seeing only a few cars in the lot. My husband ordered the hungry man plate.. hash browns were mush, bacon and sausage were fine but there was a hair in the eggs. Waitress came back exchanged it for a club sandwich which was ok. My sister in law ordered Philly cheese steak with fries and it also had a hair on it. I ordered the same thing and mine was fine maybe needed a lil more salt.. best thing was the fries.. my brother ordered the steak and eggs and said it was good. The kids' plates were also ok. As I got up my foot fell in a hole! It looked like it used to be a drain  but literally covered it with a thin piece of carpet! We will not be back there. For the price and quality we would've been better at Dennys or Ihop.
1593	0	a	We went there on 11/22/14 for breakfest and the sign on the door said they business is closed.  The Landlord took repossession of the business for failure to pay rent.
1594	0	a	I am not surprised that this place is closed and the locks have been changed.  Food was awful.  Service was awful.  There is nothing good that I could say about this place.  Maybe if the owner had every been present instead of worrying about opening a new restaurant,  he would have had more control.
1595	0	a	Let me just say I'm new to yelp and figured I must add a review.\nI been to this new location 3 times now and I can say I don't want to return. \nWent in a week ago to get my usual salad and while ordering my food I had to yell for them to hear me. I got to the cashier and she was very nice and told me the next time I come in I have a free meal on my stamp card considering I had 9 before I went in there. So I came in today to get my free meal and bought one also for a friend, a different cashier told me I would buy one meal and get one free. After paying I asked for a new stamp card and she handed me one with no stamps? Confused, I asked for a stamp and she told me I didn't have enough on my previous card to get one and argued with me. I had 10 stamps enough for one free and I bought a meal, but yet she couldn't give me a new stamp for the one I bought? Horrible customer service. Get it together.
1596	0	a	The food is the same as any other Cafe Rio however the service is awful. In the middle of my order the food line person left. 10 minutes later another new employee came over and had no idea what order was who's. In the meantime  the food sat there getting cold. If you haven't been there yet go soon as I believe this location won't last long.
1597	0	a	I give one star for a recommendation we were given by one of their employees to try the chicken and the gal at the cash register for knocking off a few bucks for the hasstle we had.  So excited this opened in a spot in the Vons plaza that has sat vacant since Starbucks came and went.  We almost walked out seeing the line but since the food is so good we decided to stay and wait and wait and wait for 20 minutes.  My husband is a steak kind of guy and after waiting we were told sorry we are out of steak.  I said for him to check with his manager and was told it would be another 20 minutes before it was ready.  What was interesting everyone was at their posts but the grill often times was left unattended. You should never run out of steak - come on.  So, here we are stuck if we didn't wait long we would have walked out.  We complained and then suggested they let everyone know in line.  It looked like to me there were not enough workers and no management on site.  I think undercover boss needs to come in and check this place out.  I will say we liked what we got all fresh food but after waiting and being hungry you are really eating so fast not enjoying the food.  Please get more help here.
1598	0	a	I have been to cafe rio on Stephanie never a problem excited because this one is close to my house, ordered a cheese  enchilada and taco total confusion on line and just in general rude! Sat down enchilada was cold on the inside so I ask them to warm it and the manager took it and threw it in the trash remade it and took so long now my taco was cold so my husband takes my taco up and the the manager mumbles something rude under her breath about remaking it and when my husband ask for the manager she throws a business card at him and says that's me! The dining room is freezing! Won't go back to this one till they make some changes! They really need a new manager!
1599	0	a	My wife just left the restaurant with 4 meals. All meals had no rice because they ran out. Called to complain and the manager was rude and told me that there was a sign stating no rice available. Wrong! There was no sign! Manager would not offer any free meal just chips and salsa. I will never give them.my business again! I'll patronize Wahoos right down the  street from now on!\n\nDon't come into our neighborhood and be all full of yourself and expect our business!
1600	0	a	Been waiting for a long time for a place like this to be in my area and now that it is, I'm very disappointed.  The service was horrible, and nobody there looked like they were in charge.  The food was decent, though not as good as other cafe Rio's in the valley.
1601	0	a	My burrito was given to someone else and I caught the mistake. Then our chips were not cooked so we asked for done ones and the manager comes back with a smart alec answer telling his cooks we want them extra crispy. No buddy, we just don't want them raw!!! The drive to Stephanie is world it. When you get the right food though it is very good.
1602	0	a	I've been coming to cafe rio since someone stole his idea and called it cafe cabo. So it's been years. And I've been to the eastern location as well as the one in Stephanie. This one is TERRIBLE! a bunch of teenagers running the back. One yelling at her coworkers screaming profanities. \n\nThe food was not as good as the other ones. My guacamole was black and old. Ew. \n\nAnd the WORST part of it all was the straws. Whoever owns this one must be too cheap. All the other locations have individually wrapped straws... This one has a pile of straws in the straw container UNWRAPPED! EW! Is that even complying with health codes?! So disgusting. All the peoples dirty hands ugh so gross. Needless to say I won't be returning to this one. \n\n\nEw.
1603	0	a	So, I have been to more than a few Caf\u00e9 Rios all over the valley and even out of state, and unfortunately this place doesn't do the name justice. You would think being a chain the food would all be the same, unfortunately this was much lower quality than any of the other establishments I have been to. The beans were undercooked, their assembly line was terrible, beans in the rice, cilantro in the cheese, a cup in the house dressing.. I didn't really want to complete the order, but my fianc\u00e9 insisted. \n\nAside from the mediocre food the service was horrible, they threw the salad together like taking my order was annoying to them. The worst part was the straws.. Not individually wrapped.. I don't know if this is the manager's doing or the owner's.. Either way, the Caf\u00e9 Rio name will only take you so far. Hopefully you aren't failing on purpose.
1604	1	a	I like this place its not Authentic mexican food if thats what you are expecting you are an idiot , food is good and i like it not so impress with the youngtas working there tho they slack the lady that cleans can be more helpful than the kids working in the kitchen .
1605	0	a	If you're craving CR don't stop at this location. The food assembly line is DISGUSTING! Rice in the beans, cheese in the cilantro,  plastic lids in the guac AND the sever had a hard time keeping her messy gloved finger out of the dressing....gross.\n\nThis location is a disappointment.
1606	0	a	I live really close to this location and was looking forward to it opening. I have gone to it a hand full of times now and they have been out of grilled chicken and grilled steak every time I have tried lunch and dinner times. Completely unacceptable especially for a new location that should be on top of their game.
1607	0	a	"Not so happy with this location right now. I went to get the special of the day (coconut shrimp) only to be \""greeted\"" by an employee I had to speak too first. I walked  and she looked at me as though I had a third eye, so I said \""hello\"" to her. I ordered the shrimp and they are out of the mango salsa that comes with it.. Only the main topping.. No big deal. Then, I decide to treat myself to dessert, key lime pie. They're put of pie. I then inquire the chocolate flan. Guess what? Don't have that either and no other desserts are made yet. It's 3pm. Alright.. Get home and try the rice. HARD and crunchy. They need to get it together! I even asked when they would have desserts for if there is a time of day things that I think should also be made are made. The cashier said anytime, just not now. Awesome. Thank you.."
1608	0	a	We have attended this location 3 different times. Unfortunately every time the people working the counter are extremely slow and the food is either too salty or under cooked (rice). This location needs to get its act together to keep up with the businesses around the area.
1609	0	a	We were thrilled to finally get a Cafe Rio in our area.  However, after several visits we are ready to say goodbye to our new location and travel back to the Stephanie or Eastern locations.  The service here is horrible, the restaurant is freezing cold and the food is less than mediocre.  The servers are rude and when I ask for extra pico, I am treated like I am asking for something impossible!  \n\nIt is time for management to step-up and take control and make some much needed changes!!!
1610	0	a	I've been to this cafe rio several times and although the food isn't great, it's a closer drive than the cafe rio on Stephanie. Most times, their rice is hard, beans are undercooked or just look like they have been sitting out for days. Even the area where they make the food looks super unsanitary. Today I waited 30 minutes in line only to get to order and find out they're out of pork and chicken. If you're going to be out of something, you should at least tell the people waiting in line! I wouldn't suggest this location. I'd rather take the drive for better food and service.
1611	0	a	We thought we would try this location because it is close to our house. We walked in at 6:30 pm and was suprised it was not that busy. We stood in a short line of 10 people and it still took 30 minutes to get our meal. My wife ordered chicken nachos and they were out of chicken and we had to wait for Kevin to cook it. The staff were nice but you can tell they are uninspired and lack direction. Never coming to this location again.
1612	0	a	"Drive a couple extra minutes and go to Stephanie or Eastern.\n\nWe went there on Friday 10/17 around 8 PM. From the time we walked in, all the employees were scrambling around doing their side work to close up shop even though they closed two hours later. The young woman behind the counter making our food could not hear us multiple times, which is fine, but at least have a little common courtesy. The word \""what?\"" came out of her mouth about 16 times throughout the time we ordered. She was unfamiliar with the menu and how to prepare the food. She turned my daughter's quesadilla into what looked like pile of regurgitated cheese, chicken, and flour tortilla. \n\nThey said they had no steak for my burrito and I was not told they were making more or more was on its way. I doubt they ran out that early on a Friday night and I'm sure they were just simply too lazy to cook more. When we checked out, the girl at the register tried to charge us for two extra sides of chicken which were never ordered.\n\nInside and outside, the place looked a like a tornado tore through. Three of the tables still had trays with trash from previous guests that were there before. Both trash cans outside were overfilled with trash with some trash on the ground.\n\nIt wasn't a good experience for my family at all and I don't think it will change anytime soon. I'm going to Stephanie next time and recommend you go to another location also."
1613	0	a	Never had a worse experience at a Cafe Rio ever and I've been eating there for over 10 years. Walked in at 5:50 and didn't get my food until 6:27 and there were FIVE people in front of me in line. Staff was openly complaining about having to work on Halloween, picking up stuff off the ground with same gloves as handling food, ran out of all kinds of food by 6:30, kept burning things, food was scattered all over the place. They even let people come in the door about 6:15 and then told them at 6:30 they were closed. Whoever owns this one should never be allowed to own another one!
1614	0	a	"I love Cafe Rios food, but I've been dissapponted just about every time I've been to this location. I keep giving them a shot only based on the fact that they are newly opened and I understand that there are bugs to work out with training employees and such, but now that they've been open a couple months, there's just no excuse. Besides messy food assembly line, and poor customer service, the guacamole I got on my salad was brown and the lettuce wilted. And don't bother calling in an order. It does nothing. They wouldn't acknowledge that I was standing there waiting for my order and when they finally did, it was \""sorry.\"" THEN.....I had to go stand in line. Ugg! Skip this location and just drive down to Eastern or Stephanie. Seriously."
1615	0	a	"By far the worst experience I have ever had at a cafe rio! We walk in and aren't greeted by anyone and the place is a complete mess! The employees are just hanging around talking. We realize that there isn't very much of anything left, being that it was 8pm we figured they would be bringing out more, but NOPE. We asked the employee and she said they aren't making anymore food and suggest we go somewhere else. She then looked at my boyfriend and said \""she's too pretty to eat here just take her somewhere else\"" the girls behind the counter were extremely rude and unprofessional."
1616	0	a	Wow! OMG! Make it end! These are phrases I utter to myself whilst camping in the line at this particular Cafe Rio. I have no idea what transpired at this location but I would literally drive to the other side of town to get my Cafe Rio fix. I have been here a total of 3 times, each visit more disastrous than the last. One evening, like a Monday, they literally had no protein other than shredded chicken left. I also had to wait for lettuce. That's right kids, lettuce. Not sure if this is a franchise situation but owning the name and storefront doesn't excuse under staffing and poor inventory planning. Get it together!
1617	0	a	I went here because i had a coupon and to avoid Stephanie street.\nThe girls in the line are rude! mean and have no idea how to give a good costumer service! they don't listen or put attention to anything you are trying to say.\nThey act like if they were doing you a favor.\nI won't comeback to this location! i don't care driving to the Stephanie location, where they always welcome you with a smile and staff is friendly and food is great! :)
1618	0	a	Worse experience I have had at a Cafe Rio!\nStood in line which moved about 3feet in 25 minutes.\nWe left, along with many other people who were frustrated.\nGet it together!
1619	0	a	Let me start by saying that I love Cafe Rio in general.  I have frequented the Eastern, Maryland, Stephanie, St. George and Provo locations.  I am kind of a Cafe Rio veteran.\n\nBUT I HATE the Horizon location. It is a frustration almost very time I go there.  I live right next to this location and have been there about 10 times because it is convenient.  I've just about had enough.  I probably should drive right past this location and go to the Stephanie location.  Or, because that is too far, across the street and eat Thai or Mediterranean. \n\nI have read the reviews on Yelp, and I agree with them.  The main problems can be summed up as:\n\n1) They have horrible supply management and run out of basic ingredients all the time.\n\n2) They have horrible supply management and run out of basic ingredients all the time. (x2)\n\n3) They have horrible supply management and run out of basic ingredients all the time. (x3)\n\n4) They have horrible supply management and run out of basic ingredients all the time. (x4)\n\n5) They are sloppy on the line and tend to mix ingredients.  Not the end of the world, but a bit unpleasant.\n\nSo, out of the 10 times I have been there, they didn't have basic ingredients about 8 of those times.  My first time experiencing this, I had to wait for beans.  Another time I saw them run out of rice, which held up the line.  Twice I have waited for them to finish cooking pork while my family finished their meals.  I ended up with takeout.  I have seen them almost run out of cheese.\n\n I've seen them run out of tortillas. TORTILLAS!  That is, in part, what kept me in line for 25 minutes tonight.  (There were only about 15 people in the line when I got there.)  Tonight I decided I didn't want pork or chicken.  That leaves shredded beef and steak.  Guess what! After waiting 25 minutes in line and waiting for them to fix their tortilla shortage, I learned that they were out of steak AND beef.  I was told I would have to wait another 8 minutes for them to cook steak.  They didn't bother to give an ETA for the beef.  I ate pork.\n\nSo, if they run out of rice, beans, tortillas, meat and almost cheese, what kind of a Mexican restaurant is this location?  Those ingredients are kind of what it means to serve Mexican food...\n\nCAFE RIO CORPORATE!  PLEASE, GET SOMEONE IN YOUR HORIZON STORE WHO KNOWS HOW TO MANAGE THE LINE.  SOMEONE WHO CAN TRAIN YOUR STAFF TO ANTICIPATE WHEN THEY NEED TO START PREPARING THE FOOD SO YOU DON'T RUN OUT.  8 OUT OF 10 TIMES IS BAD!!!! REALLY, REALLY BAD!!!!  IT HASN'T IMPROVED SINCE YOU OPENED THIS LOCATION!\n\nI also think the people there are slow workers.\n\nThat being said, I really like Cafe Rio food.  And the people there seem to be friendly and apologetic.  Please, Cafe Rio Corporate, let me love this location!
1620	0	a	Service was awful!  I've heard it was bad, but it's worse than bad.  It's awful!  Food was okay.  I had to beg for my Chips and guacamole, which I paid $4.99 for.    We can eat anywhere in Henderson and Las Vegas and be treated 100% better.  So disappointed!
1621	0	a	I usually love Cafe Rio but this location is terrible. I ordered my usual tostada and I noticed that the guacamole was starting to brown. The girl behind the counter just scooped out the brown bits then put the guacamole back. Then one of the girls behind the counter ended up starting an argument with another one of the workers in the back. I left the building very uncomfortable. When I got home and started eating, the rice was hard and stale. The barbacoa was overcooked and chewy. Needless to say I will never be going back to this location. The Stephanie location is now the only one I'm going to.
1622	0	a	If I could give this location zero stars, I would. I have been a fan of Cafe Rio for a long time. Unfortunately, the Eastern location is the only one where I have gotten good, consistent service. \n\nThere was only five people ahead of me in line. For restaurants like this, that is not very many people at all. The style of eatery can be compared to chipotle. I've been served faster at the eastern location with lines out the door. The people on the line should have spent less time giggling with each other and more time focused on getting people's orders together. \n\nTheir whole food line was a mess. I had dressing spilled all over my dressing cup, grease and whatever else was on their counter all over my salad container, and food spilling from one container into others. One girl was swapping out the dressing, and did not care that it completely spilled into the cheese container. She acted like it did not even happen. My salad tastes okay, my only complaint about the food was my tortilla tastes really old and crunchy. \n\nThe line took so long because there was no one at the stations. When someone finally asked what we wanted, he slid our salads down the line to no one! We stood at the toppings station for a good while before someone came over to help. The manager was completely clueless. He wasn't assertive and didn't tell his staff that they should stay put at their stations to get the line moving. It doesn't take four people to switch out a cheese container.
1623	0	a	First, let me say that Cafe Rio as a whole is a good fast food choice.  I've been to other locations and have been satisfied.\nHowever, this location is very poorly managed.  Service is horrible, whatever the time of day and however many people are in line ahead of you, it's just painfully slow.  Amazing, really, given the 10-12 workers they have behind the counter. They are always out of items on the menu, and the obnoxious day manager just blames the night crew.  No apologies, no offer to try and make it right, just blame and a blank stare (pick something else! is implied, I guess).  I've given this place 5 or 6 chances now, but I won't be back.  Shame, really, since it's right down the street from where I live and would be very convenient.
1624	0	a	I love Cafe Rio but every time I visit this location the service is the worst! The assembly line was a mess food everywhere.  After I got my order I paid the cashier then she left and walked away as I continued to wait for my receipt I finally just pulled it off the computer.  They were out of salsa and they were consistently running out of meat.  It was Wednesday at 4:45 and I was maybe the 5th or 6th person in line and it took almost 40mins. Afterwards I watched who seemed to be the supervisor mess with itching his head under his hat with his gloves on and then serve others.  Gross never going there again.
1625	0	a	Good food but consistent poor service-nobody acts like they care-don't bother ordering online- it'll actually take you longer once you get there then if you went thru the service line-I'll drive further to avoid this location which is sad because we need good places in the neighborhood.
1626	0	a	Just picked up food from here about 9:00. \nFirst of all I ordered a barbacoa burrito and chips and queso. Went to pay he told me one price then switched it on me after he told me. Also thanks for serving me burnt queso dip. This is the worst cafe rio in town by far. Very inconsistent food and service the last few times I have been has been below par. Also your supposed to serve the same food an hour before you close that you do during the middle of the day. Don't give customers scraps because they come in late!
1627	0	a	"New manager, same problems since opening.  \n\nAsked for nachos with cheese and chicken.  First person in line rudely says there are no nachos so move down the line and we will get you some nachos.  Second person in line, the manager trying to keep things together, he takes control but I still end up am waiting for 15 minutes in the dining room.  He finally gets my nachos, melts the cheese and adds the chicken, then passes it down the line to a final third server.\n\nThe third server gets yelled at to get my nachos done and he picks up someone else's cheese only nachos and asks me what I want on them.  No one in the line has any idea what is going on in this restaurant, blind leading the blind.  I correct his mistake because I am watching for a switch.  I then ask him to \""add pico,\"" and he adds pinto beans.  I can't start over so I take the order the way it is and leave.  Total time from entry to exit is 45 minutes and there were only a few people in line!\n\nWhat can I say the place is poorly managed, it has been since it opened and it still is to this day.  Better watch your food in this place because they don't have a clue."
1628	0	a	This location has a poor staff.\n\nI now understand why people dine in.  It takes so long to get thru the ordering process and checking out that the food is cold by the time you get it.\n\nThe gal putting the extras on orders was a sloppy, inefficient, wasteful mess.  Spilling everything she grabbed into every other item bin.  Not to mention having a terrible attitude.  I understand these employees are all probably paid minimum wage and are 17 or under in age but when I pay $13.00 for a Burrito that isn't even better than Chipotle with the poor service I received, it can't justify going back.\n\nThe entire ordering and timing process needs to be examined and experience dramatic changes.  There was only 6 people in line in front of me and it took me 24mins from getting my order taken to checking out.
1629	0	a	So sad...such great food and this location is a mess. Took 20 minutes to order and get my food with ONE person in front of me. Lady working was unhappy to say the least, and I stood at the counter after my food was done for 3 minutes before somebody else came over to ring me up (she was busy talking to friend that came to see her). She short charged me...didn't ring up enchilada style nor the queso dip. Normally I would correct her but I wasn't about to waste my energy helping such a pathetic group of employees. There were TWO guys eating and the place was trashed. Dirty tables, napkins strewn all over the floor...\n\nI will never go back to this location. Stephanie St. location is 100x better in every way possible. \n\nBut hey, thanks for the free queso!
1630	1	a	"Great experience here as compared to the other local Ford dealers!  \n\nNo hard sell, honest did not try any \"" bait and switch\""  they worked very hard to be able to meet my price.  Work with salesman Tibor he's very knowledgeable and conscience.  Would highly recommend them.  I am very happy with my new C Max."
1631	0	a	Will never do business with Surprise ford. Found a F150 on car gurus for $37,956. Sent multiple emails about the truck and decided to go test drive it. I decided to go talk price and when they came out the price had gone from the 37,956 to 44,000. They didnt know how the truck was listed for 37,956. I got up and left. I dont have time to play games.
1632	0	a	I wrote a review, but it ended up under Nissan for some reason.\n\n Horrible experience here. Would not deal with us. Sales man even took his business card back.\n Bought my mustang at Peoria Ford the next day.\n\nI won't even go here for service now. I realize that it probably has the same owner as here, but I will deal with Peoria Ford.
1633	1	a	Inside is huge & they have plenty of tables even when it's busy. Baristas have always been very friendly which is much different from the Union Hills location. Plenty of parking too!
1634	0	a	The location is much easier to get to and out of then the now closed 7410 West Bell Road store. Inside is much larger than previous location.  \nHowever it is not nearly as good of service now. Half a** the drink making. I guess in this area not a lot of competition.  I just guess I expect more, living in Washington.
1635	0	a	Huge fan of starbucks but this location was the worst of the worst I've been too.  The barista was rude and clueless about the drinks and POS system.  Took her 10 min to ring up 2 drinks. She Over charged me for my drink and received the wrong drink at the end.  This almost made me hate starbucks as a whole.  Will still be a customer just never back here even if they got the last coffee bean in AZ.
1636	0	a	Ordered 5 drinks,  paid for 5 and only got 4...and they are not even answering their phone..very bad customers service will never go back to this Starbucks again
1637	1	a	I like this Starbucks. The drive thru is always lightning fast. The staff is efficient and friendly. And the location itself is pretty big for a Starbucks. I'm glad they opened a location close to work for me.
1638	1	a	I stopped by here for the soft-opening before the restaurant was open to the public. The atmosphere inside was a huge change from Longboards, which operated in the space not too long ago. \n\nInside is now wood grain floors and comfy dark leather booths. The booths are shaped in a semicircle which make the space feel more open than the standard square booths that most restaurants have. On the walls they have TVs playing Clint Eastwood western movies. And above the bar is a nice selection of Tequila bottles.\n\nI ended up trying multiple tacos, with my favorite being the short rib. They make the tortillas in house, and you can taste it in how fresh the tortillas are. I also enjoyed the chicken mole taco which had delicious pickled red onions on top. The tacos are slightly on the small side, but they sure are good.\n\nThe staff was friendly and very helpful in giving me suggestions for tequila to sip on. Overall, I was impressed with the food and service and look forward to trying them again.
1639	1	a	Great atmosphere, friendly service, really cool looking space but definitely use their valet or park on a side street and DO NOT PARK IN THE CONDO DECKS next door as they were towing cars tonight. Good to have a good taco place nearby as Cantina makes their move down to Park Rd.
1640	1	a	Awesome new restaurant in Dilworth!  I went there last night with a friend and after being open less than a week, the place was packed!  We were greeted immediately by the owner who gave us a description of the cocktails...he recommended the Bakersfield margarita and I'll probably never have anything else there...yummy!  The atmosphere is vibrant and casual with very friendly and knowledgeable staff.  I think this is going to be my new go-to spot in Dilworth for cocktails, good food and hanging with friends.
1641	1	a	Great atmosphere, great service (quick and knowledgeable), super tasty, fresh Mexican food! It is a small menu, but everything on it is delicious! Tons of beers on tap!\nParking isn't the greatest, but they do have valet across the street!
1642	1	a	Really enjoyed my dinner here tonight. For excellent mex-tex with a kick, order the queso with everything (jalapeno, beans, and chorizo) and the chochinita tacos. The home-made tortillas are fantastically made. Just one tortilla holds up the entire taco.
1643	0	a	Went there today for lunch and it was a really cool place with friendly staff and roll up glass garage doors opened to East Blvd, nice atmosphere, good chips and salsa. \nUnfortunatley it was nowhere near the BEST fish tacos in Charlotte like someone had  told me.   My  $4.00 Mahi taco only had a single finger sized piece of deep fried Mahi, raw corn tortilla, and  just tasted ok.  \n\nI'm sure it would be a fun place to get a drink and watch a game.\n\nCabo Fish tacos still has the best by far in my opinion.
1644	0	a	Neither food nor service are impressive, hopefully the drinks will keep this place alive until Spring. \n\nI dropped in Saturday as tacos sounded a great idea on the last of the warm fall days. When I sat at the bar & caught up with a friend for 5 to 10 minutes, it took the bartender asking to refill my friends' drinks for her to come over and even then I had to get her attention myself to get a menu or water.\n\nPerusing the menu was as disappointing. No entrees, chips & salsa are $3. Within 3 blocks is Moe's & Tijuana Flats. I get that Bakersfield's chips & salsa are made daily but do you really decide where to eat based exclusively on this side item? Tacos are $4 each and they're small. They are tasty, but flour tortillas aren't available, tacos are served on white corn tortillas only. \n\nMy friends had the short rib sandwich earlier and remarked it was good but a lot of bread. I ordered 3 tacos, one pastor and each style of chicken. They came out in a timely fashion and the pastor is a good example balanced with fresh pineapple. I couldn't tell the difference between the two chicken styles. Still peckish, I had the veggie tortilla of fried potatoes, black beans, guac and lettuce. It's quite a treat!\n\nI like the decor, the roll up doors and naked lights are a relaxed vibe. While I again waited for the bartender's attention to get my check, I noticed the bar back squeezing lemons for their margaritas. Since my friends stayed and had a pitcher they must be pretty good. It seems like a great place to drink which isn't my thing. \n\nGiven the lack of parking, other places with equally good pastor tacos at better prices (la unica on central) and no reservations you could very well hunt for parking, find it, and have an hour wait. **The manager sent a yelp compliment and clarified they have more valet spots than those at Berrybrook up to 40 spots total** Still I hope the owners have the cash to survive until spring when margaritas or beers with a gentle breeze blowing in off East Blvd is a great idea.
1645	1	a	"My wife is the one who suggested it and I do not get very excited for new places. When I saw the menu I didn't think there would be anything I would like. I actually had three of their tacos which were pretty awesome. My favorite one was the \""weird c word\"" (can't remember the name) which I highly recommend if you like spicy food. My PBR came in a boot which was pretty awesome. It was a cool atmosphere and the interior was pretty killer. I will definitely go back soon!"
1646	0	a	I was really looking forward to trying this place out! After hearing a rave review from my sister and her friend. I ordered a Bakersfield margarita and chorizo tostada. I have a insane love for anything with chorizo and tequila. But,the  food was cold and it was something I could have made at home myself and I  didn't taste the chorizo. The margarita was no better than the ones you get in the can. I'm not even sure if there was any tequila in there because it  tasted  like pure sour mix. I get easily buzzed and that margrita did nothing. My brother had the short rib sandwich he said the meat was good but the cibatta bread made the sandwich dry. The one star is for the service. Our waitress was knowledgeable and very kind. Can't say I will be going back there.
1647	0	a	Anticlimatic.  $10 for a glass of cheap cab? \nI won't be rushing back. That is for sure.
1648	1	a	I cannot say enough about the queso and chips. I don't know what the spices are but you can smell it a mile away and it is awesome. The crispy fish tacos are amazing. Order many. And to top it off Management gives good customer service.  Bravo!
1649	1	a	Lovely design and atmosphere. It is very inviting and social. Loved their whiskey selection and the red headed stranger was delicious. Their manhattan was okay until you ate some spicy tacos. The spice really brought out the sweetness and taste in the drink. I recommend getting this if you are eating. I went there with my SO, he had a short rib torta (very tasty) and I had the fish, pastor, and conchinita tacos.. all very good. They had fresh salsa and their queso app is delicious... I want that in and around my mouth, always. \n\nThis spot has had quite a few failed attempts in the past few years but I feel bakersfield may be able to break that curse. I will be returning.
1650	1	a	"I had never been to Longboards, or whatever ill-fated establishment failed in the location prior, but watching the renovations unfold from the street piqued my interest. \n\nThe space is well decorated with a vintage western vibe - garage door windows, antiques light fixtures, and distressed wood textures.\n\nStarted with the queso loaded with jalape\u00f1os, beans and chorizos to start. It was delicious. Beautiful, indulgent, cheesy deliciousness. Maybe the best queso I've ever had.\n\nSide note: $2 PBRs everyday in a glass boot - if that's your kind of thing.\n\nOrdered the mole and raja tacos. Enjoyed both, but they were a little smaller and not as stuffed as I had expected? Maybe they're bigger for dinner? I also enjoyed the few bites I had of the chicken chorizo tostada and will likely order that if I return.\n\nMaybe not the \""authentic Mexican street fare\"" like they claim, but if anything, go for the queso!"
1651	0	a	So. Much. Potential. With a long history in the food service industry, I am always sure to give a restaurant the benefit of the doubt, but Bakersfield has swung very hard, come very close, and missed. \n\nI've had a taco before, believe it or not, and this particular taco was certainly above average. The problem here lies with the atmosphere and service. My party placed their orders... Actually... Screamed their orders over the music (which was cranked to 11). When the food finally arrived, it was presented on one large tray and left to us to decipher what was what and whose was whose. \n\nI didn't mind the food, but the margarita was pretty weak, and the overall experience lacked polish and enthusiasm.\n\nI wish I could say I'll be back, as the restaurant's concept and mission are something I look for in a dining experience. However, the overall experience was a huge letdown... My future Mexican outings will be to Paco's Tacos.
1652	0	a	"I read the reviews of Bakersfield before going so I feel like I had a pretty good idea of what the vibe was.  in keeping with the Old Western theme of the place, we will go with the Good, the Bad, and the Ugly.  The good:  the interior is really cool- lots of wood with concrete counters to set your drink on in the bar area.  Our table was in the bar area and our service was good.  We started with queso and added the jalape\u00f1os.  It was very good!  I also had the corn chowder (it was pretty good), the Pollo Rojo taco (again, pretty good), and the short rib taco (very tasty).  It is a little weird that your order is served all together on a tray with your entire party's order.  They call it \""family style\"".  It's just odd.  The bad:  The noise!  I've been to loud restaurants, but this takes it to a whole different level.  I'm talking night club music blaring loud.  They play the music so loud that everyone has to talk really loud to hear each other, which just adds to the noise issue.  Our server could not hear us even when she was right next to us.  There is no reason in has to be so loud to the point that you can't hear each other.  The ugly:  the price of their \""premium\"" margarita.  At $13.00 a drink, I've had better.  I would probably give this place 3 stars, but because of the noise level, I'm not sure we will be back."
1653	0	a	Sadly, I have nothing good to say.  I have been to places with much better food, service and value in Charlotte.  The tacos you receive are about the size of a large cookie and they are $3-$4 EACH...and that does not include any sides.  No beans, no rice.  Nothing.  They are more along the lines of what you get on a dollar taco night somewhere.  They were cold - not that tacos are ever served extremely warm, but these were cold in a not good way.  Unlike any other mexican themed restaurant I have been to, you pay for the chips and salsa.  What I find more confusing, rather than frustrating, is that they GIVE you two bottles of salsa.  But when the chips come to the table, they contain two dishes of the same salsa.  It makes no sense.  Let me get on to the presentation....what you order is served family style.  6 of ordered tacos, some with special requests.  Instead of being served individually, the server points out what is what on the giant pizza tray of tacos.  The special order ones had toothpicks in them.  So there were were, sliding our tacos off the tray and onto our plates.  I could go on, but I just won't go back.  I had a sweet tea and 3 tacos and my total with tip was $18.  THAT IS RIDICULOUS.  Good luck Bakersfield.  You are a rip off in every way.
1654	0	a	Perhaps a victim of bad timing just after a trip home to California, the popular taqueria / bar has the interior and service that is buzzworthy, but the food fell flat for me. \nLet's start with the name - Bakersfield. In the 70s & 80s it and Fresno vied for the unenviable title of the armpit of California. Perhaps it's had a big renaissance and is a hip unknown treasure unbeknownst to me, but even my friends from Central Valley chuckled that we had a restaurant named Bakersfield and thought maybe it was a bad omen. \n\nThe exterior is super hip with the wood-slat awnings, garage door windows and lack of tacky signage. The interior has a warm cozy feel with lots of unfinished reclaimed wood, Edison bulbs hanging everywhere and a busy stream of patrons.  They really nailed the feel of the place and I hope they stay for a long while in this seemingly cursed spot. Finding parking is not easy when the Valet lot and street parking is full, so hopefully they might strike a deal with another local business to borrow space after hours. \n\nThe service is impeccable - very very fast food delivery and attentive service.  If you wish, you could get in and out for dinner in 30-40 minutes if you don't have to wait for a table and you're not drinking cerveza out of their adorable boot shaped glasses. \n\nBut the menu...ugh. First, I've never been to a taqueria that didn't give free chips. C'mon folks. Jack up the cost of each taco by 1 buck and give us free chips already. The prices are reasonable, so just build it in. Second, if you don't want a taco, you are really limited to tostada or 2 different tortas. The sides are also quite limited. We did have the corn chowder which really sticks to the ribs- perhaps the cheesiest, thickest chowder I've ever had. It is fantastic with their chipotle salsa on top. \n\nFor the main attraction, los tacos, they have 8(ish) different choices- two different chickens (mole & cider braised), pastor (pork & pineapple), two different vegetarian choices, a fish (mahi) and braised short rib.  My choices were really limited because I'm allergic to cilantro, so I had the mole with pickled onions and mahi without the slaw. Hubs had mahi, braised short rib, other chicken and pork. The tortilla are house made. Honestly, none of the tacos sang for us. The short rib was particularly dry, the mole was more acidic than smooth mole-ish like you want it to be, the cider braise was way vinegary, and the pork was fine.  The mahi was the top choice for both of us, though only comes with one fish finger in the middle, so don't expect to fill up on 2. Honestly, Pinky's & Cabo Fish Taco have better more filling choices.  \n \nI saved my rant for the end, so feel free to tune out now. [Steps on soapbox] As I said, maybe it was just because two weeks ago I was in the SF Bay Area and had 2 stellar flavorful taco experiences (Tacolicious and Magdaluna), and this just paled in comparison, but I don't think so. If Charlotte wants to be taken seriously as a World-Class city, we better put our big girl pants on and get some world-class cuisine. Smaller Durham and Chapel Hill even seem to be outpacing us. There's no reason why this town can't have a really good taco place or good Chinese place, etc. There's nothing magical about Californian tacos. At this point you can pretty much get every single ingredient here as you can there, so they should be just as good. Tex mex places especially have gotten lazy (hear me, Picante, Vida and Maverick Rock Taco??) and think if you put any crap in a shell people will like it or eat it.  Maybe it's that most of these places don't have that Mexican heritage? I'm trying to reach for a good reason. And no, I'm not a haughty Californian- I've now been in Charlotte longer than the Bay Area, so I'm rooting for Charlotte to get better. Sometimes we all need a kick in the pants. \n\nSo, Bakersfield, sorry for the tangent, but if you want to get serious about having good food in addition to a cool bar, recruit the guy from Burrito Factory to come in to help you with your menu/sauces. Until then, we won't be back.
1655	1	a	Have been here several times and everything each time has been great. The bartenders do a nice job keeping up. Was there last night, a Friday, and we got there just before the rush--about 615. They do a great job making fresh margaritas and definitely recommend a pitcher if we a groups of 3-4. They have a nice tequila selection (would love it even more if you would stock Ocho Tequila) and appear to have a good bourbon selection. \nThe guacamole is really good along with the sauces. I have now tried all of the tacos--favs are the braised beef and the mole tacos. The others are great too--full of flavor!  Typically very fast but I think they lost our order last night as it took a while and the manager came to apologize. Not a big deal as they were slammed. \nNot sure if they have improved the parking situation or not, we parked at the Teeter. Valet was full when we walked by.
1656	1	a	J'attendrais aussi un peu, mais en soit le restaurant est super beau, la bouffe est tr\u00e8s bonne avec des produits de grandes qualit\u00e9s. Bravo. Bon resto!!
1657	0	a	We ordered the basil pesto chicken pizza. Flavor wise it was okay. The main turn off how how greasy the base was. My hands were coated with grease and afterwards my mouth felt all greasy.
1658	1	a	They put on a great show. I've seen them three or four times and it is different each time. Teens and younger children love it as much as the adults. Truly an all ages event. I can't recommend this enough.
1659	0	a	I don't recommend this place at all. My friends and I ordered different menus but no one was satisfied.
1660	1	a	I came here once with my friends and we order bulgogi, gamjatang, and something else I can't remember. My friends were comparing this place to Minerva but I've never tried Minerva at this point and thought the food was on point! I did go to Minerva several weeks later and I thought the gamjatang was a lot better at Nuri Village - however I haven't had a lot of Korean food in my life. The service was really friendly, I liked the family vibe I got. The owner spoke some Korean with my friend which was nice.
1661	0	a	It was  decent  However  I did get charged  incorrectly  each  month. I addressed the issue each month and nothing  was solved I was still being forced to pay the extra $25 dollars. Other then that the staff was half on the friendly side and the property was decent.
1662	0	a	"I reserved judgment until my second visit. It's just not good. \n\nToday I ordered the kung pao noodle bowl with tofu. When they called my number, they had made it with chicken. I told them about the mistake and they re-made the dish. When I got it back it was mostly cold and just did not have good flavor. The way they slice their vegetables doesn't really make sense. The slices of red and green bell peppers were huge. It didn't taste fresh, and there was no depth of flavor, just a lot of sweet sauce. Nowhere close to real kung pao. The Lipton tea they have tastes very processed, and not \""fresh brewed\"" as it is labeled."
1663	0	a	Ate here for first time. My wife's parents owned a Chinese take out restaurant so speaking from that perspective. This place is just OK. Nothing special and over priced. I ordered extra protein (sumo protein) and did not appear I got much more. Also there was a plastic twisty in my food. They were apologetic and gave me a $10 gift certificate but won't be back.
1664	0	a	Standard wok place. My experience was that the udon noodles were mushy, there was hardly any chicken in my bowl and they have the fake syrup iced tea. The only two positives I've got are the fresh vegetables and the fast, friendly service. I won't likely go back.
1665	0	a	"Tried calling an order in ahead of time... Got a \""message inbox full\"" message 3 times. Ordered 2 entrees (kung pao chicken and crispy ckicken) to-go. The cashier ignored me for about 5 minutes while she took a phone order (the phones do work! I confirmed that the number I tried was accurate). They had a 'tip field' on the receipt... That bugs me at a take-out/semi-fast food type place. Food came out quick. Food was decent."
1666	0	a	Americana Asian food that's mediocre at best. The ambiance and decor are nice but the food and customer service aren't great.  We got the padthai and firecracker.  Padthai had zero flavor even and the firecracker was only a little better.  Definitely NOT spicy, even after dousing the padthai with siracha.  Noodles were a bit too al dente, as well.  The veggies are fresh though and the spring rolls were decent, although they forgot to include them when we picked up our order.  Speaking of that, the dude called out our number and another number so I went to the counter to pick up our food and he denied calling our number and acted perturbed that I was at the counter.  Go to firehouse subs next door and don't waste your hard earned money on this place.
1667	1	a	Just found my favorite new restaurant ,friendly staff , very healthy & Price is reasonable . Totally recommend it
1668	0	a	"If you're really paying attention to this review, do NOT eat here.  Honestly, this is the worst supposed \""Chinese\"" food I've ever had.  The service was awful, having to wait 20 minutes for food while the cashier kept saying \""sorry, sorry\"" all the while there was 5 or 6 people ahead of my buddy and I (that's busy?) I've eaten better food at a Chinese food place in a bad neighborhood that advertises $3 meals all the while the chef is in the back with a cigarette hanging out off his mouth, ya' know? Any way, I'm really sorry, but if I don't get sick from this place, I'll be surprised. Never again."
1669	0	a	The guy wiped his nose, didn't wash his hands, went ahead to make my food with his filthy hands. Freaking sick. Freaking sick. Freaking sick.
1670	1	a	Shakes at this place are amazing. It's not the most cost efficient place but to their defense they are located in a shopping mall on the strip. The staff is very friendly and helpful. They even made a shake they had never done before because I inquired about it. Overall cool place!
1671	1	a	My husband and I were just there. We absolutely loved our shakes! One of the best shakes I have ever had in my life actually!!! A little slower at getting the product out too you but the wait is worth it because they use actual product instead of all that other syrups and stuff. I will be a faithful customer when ever we are there. I will make sure I stop to get a shake for sure!!!!!  the owner is from England and has a cute accent and was the sweetest guy asked us if we wanted to try the ready to order donuts and they were amazing!!!!!!! Carmel ones are the best!!! Very cute place...!
1672	1	a	This place is amazing. I was called nature's care. They went through a minor renovation and they offer a few more services. I went in for a 30 min foot detox and 45 min foot massage.  Joyce is amazing. She recognized me when I walked in and gave me a mini tour of the upgrades. \nShe offers full body massages, facials(coming soon), and lymphatic massages now. Joyce had an appointment coming soon after I arrived so a lady named Ping gave me my massage. She was the nice lady. Just the right amount of pressure on my feet and calves( I've been working out alot lately). I asked her to massage me wrists once she concluded the foot massage. Not only was it no problem to accommodate my request, she gave both my arms a quick once over. I really appreciate it. It's time for a nap......lol. I've been to other foot massage places before and they don't compare to Essence Spa. I don't like how after the therapist is done, they always stalk you for a tip.  I'm not cheap by any stretch, but I only tip for quality service. Joyce and Ping certainly fit the bill.
1673	1	a	Detox foot baths are awesome!   Clean, comfortable,  welcoming environment.  Will be a regular customer.
1674	1	a	This is really a decent place. I was travelling with my boyfriend and got a couple's massage for only $100 and an facial for myself before we take off. ( which is their special package). The atmosphere is so relaxing, we fall in sleep like a baby.  Sophia is such a experienced and knowlegable esthetician. She made my face rejuvanated right away. They even do the most popular 3D permenant make up.  They offer so many services wish I had time to enjoy all. Will definetly come back.
1675	1	a	Happened to be in container park and decided to try out this brand new spot. The Perch has a menu outside to check out before going in. The decor is very nice. Service was okay. I had to ask to get a refill on water, that's a big red flag for me...they weren't that busy at the time either...anyways the Salmon app was very good! High quality salmon that melts in your mouth. Steak sandwich was pretty good, and I did like the fries with it. My mother got a (equivalent to Greek) salad and added shrimp...she enjoyed it but we didn't feel it was worth the price. Crime br\u00fbl\u00e9e for dessert was on point!! The manager/owner came by to ask about our experience and feedback which was nice. Since its brand new, I feel if the management is very observant with guests, menu items and prices and are open to changing little things were need be for the better, the restaurant will do very well.
1676	1	a	Fun place to try. They had a different kind of foods. Something different! I had the margarita pizza; was Delish!! Calamari and crab cakes my husband loved.  My husband had a IPA beer, he liked it a lot.  Kids menu price was very reasonable. Service was really attentive and good!
1677	1	a	The Perch is a nice place to grab a drink and a bite to eat. It has a casual yet upbeat atmosphere. The menu is simple however the food and service are very good!
1678	1	a	Ate there for the first time tonight. Very friendly staff with excellent food and service. We were served by Caitlyn (Kaitlin) not sure of the spelling. Great lager from Spain and great German Riesling sine. Desert was fantastic.
1679	1	a	Love this new place! Since we got siked out from the Wineyard being only open on Fridays which is a bummer, we were looking for a Tuesday night Happy Hour.  Heard about this opening and so glad we went.\n\nService and food were amazing!  Plus it's so cute! It was a perfect night to dine outside.  And while no happy hour, the prices are very reasonable.  We had 2 flatbreads which were both really good.  One with quail egg, spinach abs cheese, so yummy!  The other was a shrimp, cilantro and bean one, also very delicious.  Fries with garlic aioli was my fav, I will crave these and must go back!\n\nThe wine was perfectly chilled as we'll and everyone who greeted and served us was super nice! Definitely going back, will be a regular :)
1680	0	a	Another restaurant posting 11pm close but the kitchen closes @ 10pm. Obviously ran by mammalukes. wasted our time with these clowns arriving slightly after 10 to be denied... thanks the perch for wasting my time..
1681	1	a	Was initially concerned that this restaurant would be a bit too hipster-veggie for me upon seeing their scant menu. Turns out they're quite carnivore friendly and focus on doing a few things very well.\n\nHad the hanger steak frites, with garlic aeoli. Turns out the garlic aeoli goes better on the STEAK than the frites (fries), truly enhancing the flavor. Once I figured this out, I was good to go and had a delicious time. The fries are lightly salted, crisp, and tasty. \n\nThe service is great. I love how brightly lit the space is with clean lines and the pink-lit shelves behind the bar. So glad there's another restaurant outside of barbecue and Mexican at the Container Park. Can't wait to go again!
1682	0	a	WTF is up with LV restaurants stating over the phone the kitchen's open till 11, but refusing to serve guests at 10:22 after they rush across town??  We were looking forward to checking out this new spot, but after the bartender rebuffed us so arrogantly upon arrival, we're over it. See ya, Perch!
1683	1	a	So clean!  Great service!  The food is spot on Every Time!  Favorite is the beef tartare which seems totally scary because it's raw meat and a raw quill egg but it's freaking amazing unreal and I also like that Bianca flatbread and the Allegra flatbread the Allegra sounds totally weird like refried black beans shrimp who would think to put that all together on a pizza but it's on unbelievable you got to go in there you got to see it it's so fun it's so yummy it's so unique and it's so awesome and Chef Sonia is amazing!!!!
1684	0	a	I wish I could place the photo for reference here but I did add the photo to the collection. I was excited to try The Perch for the first time last night. I ordered their $20 Egg Salad with steak and ask for it to go. My destination was right in the park so this wasn't due to travel time but when I opened up my salad, I was extremely disappointed. The bread crostini were so hard I couldn't even eat them, literally could not even bite into it. The poached egg was still half raw and yolkless, couldn't eat it that either. The steak was really rare and looked like it had been squeezed together. The salad itself was seriously maybe 6 bites worth that included some bacon pieces, possibly less than 2oz of steak. This was not a refined $20 salad I was expecting, it was a $4 dollar salad at best. I will not be trying there food again because the lack of passion for the food clearly shows. Restaurants should be proud of the food they are putting out, even if it is to go.
1685	1	a	Steak Tartar was delicious. View and service were awesome as expected. My only concern was that it was very hard to hear in the enclosed dining area, though the music was not loud. I think it was the fact that it room is glass enclosed. I will be going back to work my way through the menu.
1686	1	a	Ordered beef tartare, hangar sandwich, angel hair, and juice. They were a bit slow in serving the angel hair. Wasn't a huge deal. Turns out they took it off our bill, took the drink off our bill, and gave us a complimentary belle flatbread and a complimenary torte cake. The food was pretty great too, for that matter.
1687	1	a	Great atmosphere, waitress Chelsy was beyond lovely and caring. The best! Will definitely come back any day :)
1688	0	a	This place is expensive and overrated.  Where do people get off with 5 stars?  The container park theme is awful.  Looks llke downtown LA.  Complete with a screaming crazy street person out in front.  The grounds look dirty and cheap.  \n\nPrices were outrageous for what you got.  Will never go back there again.  Had some crab louie salad.  So they cut an avocado in 2, slop a brown looking ball of god knows what into the pit area, and set it on top of some butter leaf lettuce.  Easily the worst I have ever seen in this type of fare.  My little friend got who knows what, but even she was put off by the food.  It looked bad from my side of the table.  \n\nMaybe this is the best you can do downtown, but I can get excellent, and tasty, dinner entrees at places like the Venetian for about the same money.  Better ambiance too.  I don't give a crap if it is supposed to be a cool hipster dive.  It was an awful experience and the food was downright repulsive.
1689	1	a	The former tenant was Blockbuster...which has since been renovated as a nice comfy clean Urgent Care PIus... sprained my wrist when I tripped and landed on on it while gardening. It was was quite swollen and painful, So I came in on a Friday morning at 9:30 am,,, and had to fill out the usual paperwork and paid my $50 deductible. There was one person getting treated and after 20 minutes, it was my turn.Suddenly lots of people came in... It could've been a long wait had I arrived an hour later.  Since it was 102 deg. outside, people seemed content waiting in an air conditioned place.\n\nThe young Medical Assistant (MA) looked like he was one of the skateboarders on any city street..but he was actually quite professional and upbeat, asking questions about my injury and taking vitals quickly.  The doc came in, and said that an x ray was needed,  The MA was also the x ray tech and was quit good at explaining what I had to do.  It took no more than 10 min. for that.  He put a custom made splint on my wrist, explaining what he was doing and how to take care of it and my injury.   I kinda sweated waiting for results of the x ray. A fracture could mean a cat, surgery, and/or a long road.\n\nIn 5 minutes...the doc came in and said the x rays showed no fractures.He prescribed Tramadol....though I may not use it.  Advil is fine. Overall this was a quick and easy experience.  Hope not to come back, but I would if I had to.
1690	0	a	"Do not go here!  If I could give zero stars I would.  The owner will talk you into buying bad quality hair that is far over priced.  I went in looking for a particular brand and I was talked out of it by being told that the brand I was looking for had a \""bad batch\"".  When I showed up at my hair appt 1 hr later my stylist refused to put it in.  I live in CA and drove to Las Vegas to get my hair done and was unable to do so because of this store. When I called to inquire about returning it I was lectured and actually yelled at by the owner himself.  He refused to return the hair stating they do not give money back.  I was not informed of the policy, it is not stated anywhere on the receipt, and did not see it in store.  This is how a local business with stiff competition down the street wants to do business.  Sounds like they will be going out of business if this is how the owner treats customers.  Canyon Falls is the place to go, they only sell top quality and do not treat their customers how Nicole's does."
1691	0	a	It's nice to have another beauty supply store in the area, but wen we walked in, they really didn't greet us.  Then finally someone asked if we needed any help, by then we already realized there prices are alot higher than Sally's.  And we felt like they were following us around like we were going to steal something!  I won't be spending my money in this store!
1692	0	a	Came here and was told that they hair I purchased was virgin Brazilian hair. I bought it as well as with some micro links. What a waste of time for me and my stylist. The extensions were out in and I didn't even last a day when I told my stylist that the hair was shedding and felt horrible. I threw out $200 so upset!!!! . I wouldn't recommend this place.
1693	1	a	Excellent food & service!!! We were seated immediately upon arrival even though the place was nearly full. We were handed menus and our server took our drink orders were taken right away without being pushy.\n\nThe entire time we were there we watched the staff work efficiently while maintaining a friendly attitude. Service was quick and excellent.\n\nNow food!!!! We ordered the Pho Special Combo, egg rolls, a pork sandwich and a chicken sandwich.\n\nThe rolls were crunchy on the outside and tender on the inside, without being oily or greasy. They are hands down the best I've had in all of Phoenix!!! The dipping sauce was thinner than I expected but full of great flavor! Sweet but not too sweet and the perfect compliment to the rolls.\n\nThe sandwiches were next, great value and great tasting both had tender meat and were also full of great flavors. The buns were a little too big. But overall no complaints.\n\nThe Pho was great, & aromatic. I could smell the cinnamon, cloves, anise a mile away! I was worried that the broth might actually be overpowering but it wasn't, the flavors were spot on and what I expect of a good pho.\n\nI will definitely be back here soon!
1694	1	a	This is really nice place, the atmosphere is nice.\nFood is really good, I had Quang Nam Noodle (N1) best noodle, also egg-roll is fantastic (I consider this is best in town!) \nService is great very friendly very attentive, the staff take your drink orders right away.\nThey just open few days but they meet my all my expectation so they deserve 5stars!\n\nHighly  recommended this place
1695	1	a	Wow!! I've had a lot of Pho in my life, but this place is by far the best EVER! This is my new fav spot. Don't change a thing owners, it's perfect!! \n\nFood 5 stars\nService 5 stars\nAmbience 5 stars \n\nWe had the red pork spring rolls, P.1 and yellow noodle dish was exotic but flavor was  scrumptious
1696	0	a	HIRE MORE SERVERS OMGGGGGGGGGGG\n\nPho is supposed to be quick. I don't understand why it takes more than 30 minutes to take an order and serve the dang food!!! \n\nFood was taking way too long so asked for togo but they forgot the things I asked them to include when they knew we were leaving early because we were in a rush. OMG..... So frustrating
1697	0	a	Let me start out by saying that this was one of the nicest pho places I've been to.  The place is clean and decorated nicely.  But ambiance aside, the food left much to be desired.  The spring rolls were mostly filled with noodles so you could barely taste the shrimp or pork.  Portion sizes seem way off for the prices.  It's not expensive, but when you compare to your standard pho places where a bowl is around $6-7, and this place charges $10, you're really paying for the atmosphere and not the food quality.  Because the food was not the greatest.  I think I'd rather go back to the hole-in-the-wall places that have out of this world pho than pay extra for lackluster broth and nice surroundings.
1698	1	a	Good Pho, a little light on the meat but a great presentation and taste. Really great portions for the price. The spice was great and ambiance was very clean, especially for a Vietnamese restaurant. I hope they last. I really enjoyed the food!
1699	0	a	Pho was alright. Took 30 mins for it.. It was a sunday & there were a couple big groups but the servers seemed to pay more attention to them & put us on the back burner. Passion fruit juice tastes like it was fresh. Very delicious. Really wanted to like this place (it's right by my house) but I've had better pho sadly.
1700	0	a	I wanted to like this place because it is literally a stones throw from my house but...I just can't do it.   The decor is great.  The bar looks cool.  Service is very good and friendly.   Even the apps are good.  But the main dishes are overpriced, small quantity and lacking flavor.  I didn't get the Pho...maybe that was my problem.   The menu is weak. Outside of the apps.  They have pho, vermicelli and rice dishes.  That's it.  Very very disappointed!  Chandler Pho is 100 times better.  I won't be back until they fix it.
1701	0	a	I was pretty\nExited to have a pho place to open near by. They have amazing decor. The service is ok but the first Time I went they took forever just to make pho and there were only a little bit of people. Food is not so good. The regular pho is about seven bucks but they serve it in a small bowl. The large is like a regular bowl I would get in other pho places. The pho had a somewhat plain taste and the noodles break apart too easily. The also clump together and made it that I was eating noodles that my grandma would cut up when I was young. I would not recommend this place. if u want to eat pho go to chandler pho.
1702	0	a	Place is nice enough, ambience was good...but I'm not here to eat the ambience. We ordered a variety of dishes including Pho, Bun, and another noodle dish. All the food was very bland, even their fish sauce tasted like it was watered down. \n\nService was slow as well, although the servers were very nice. The place wasn't packed but yet everything took forever. There were no utensils on the table, no napkins, and no condiments (hoisin sauce and sriracha). Every Vietnamese restaurant has these items on every table. \n\nThe only thing that was good was the coffee jello we got for dessert. \n\nThis place is closer to home, but I'd rather drive a little bit further and go to Pho Chandler...that place is good.
1703	0	a	I am a PHO-NATIC!  I have eaten at almost every Pho place in the Valley... I am soo happy when this place opened so close to my house! Then I was sadly VERY disappointed. Service was terrible, 45 min for egg rolls and a bowl of pho. Eggs rolls were ordered as an app. They came AFTER my pho. The fianc\u00e9 ordered the beef and rice dish, they took they same thin cuts of beef they put in the Pho Tai and cover it in sauce and service it with rice.. portion couldn't even feed a 3 year old, I had to take him the burger king after we left the restaurant.. Now back to the important thing.. the Pho.. Watered downed broth that tasted of nothing but greasy cinnamon, no deep pho flavor at all .. SO disappointed I will never go back.  It tasted like they were running out of broth and just poured a bunch of water in it to get them through the rush hour, GAG.
1704	0	a	We were the only people in there today.  Building interior is lovely. Our waitress was nice enough and attentive.  Food came out very quick, but our egg rolls were cold and they only give one piece of lettuce for two egg rolls.  We sent them back and asked for hot egg rolls. Shortly after our pho came out.  It was just okay.  Nothing to get excited about.  Then the fresh, hot egg rolls came out and they were bland.\nWith so many other options for pho nearby, we will choose one of our other favorites next time.
1705	1	a	We've been here a few times and it's great every single time. The Pho, rice, noodles are all very good. Very fresh spring rolls with excellent peanut sauce. Give them a try and judge for yourself.
1706	1	a	Spring rolls were fresh and delicious and I had the Pho with thinly sliced beef. The spring rolls and pho were delicious and the service was top notch!  My first and not last visit for sure!!
1707	0	a	Bad value. Did cost twice as much as other pho places in town and isn't half as good. In a vacuum, it's ok. But I just cannot recommend this place considering the competition such as Saigon pho or even pho Chandler
1708	0	a	Food looked good but tasted decent, but there were nats and mosquitos flying around in the restaurant so it was difficult to enjoy. I had to stop eating my meal bc they flew into my food, was very disappointed.
1709	1	a	My dogs love going to Learning Pawsibilities! They have great room to run and play, have lots of individual attention from everyone there and toys/agility equipment to keep them busy. They come home happily tired from a fun day of play. I completely trust my fur babies to Mirna and her team.\n\nCan't recommend enough!
1710	1	a	I took my Aussie, Tessa, for a couple of hours of day care.  She came back smiling and ready for a nap.  So this is really her review :)\nA really nice place with great gals running the show.
1711	1	a	LOVE this place. Very spacious with a helpful staff. Tables and chairs were set up for us by the stall. Bags plus bucket and mop for clean ups. Very nice folks. The dogs had a blast.
1712	1	a	Not going to lie, I did not trust this place one bit because come on - the place used to be a sex toy/clothing shop. In my mind, I just couldn't see how the place could be built for dog boarding but, Mirna (owner) proved me wrong.\n\nCentral Phoenix was seriously lacking a dog boarding center despite how dog-friendly the Biltmore/Arcadia businesses are and how apartment ridden this area is. I was going on vacation but moved from the 24/7 Gilbert Dogs area and needed to find somewhere closer than having to basically trek to Mexico just so my dog could be boarded.\n\nThis place was literally steps nearby and once again, I was wary due to the former business it used to be and how new it was with not many reviews. I first went to take a look at the the place and Mirna more than willingly gave me a tour. No dildos or bras surprisingly, but an actual agility/play area with more than 4 sections to move dogs around. 40 bucks a night is more expensive than most other places but if you look at their Facebook page, you'll see why.\n\nMy beast of a dog isn't exactly dog friendly after being attacked and finds other dogs annoying. I don't know where she got that from, definitely not me *eyes shifting*. It was my first time boarding and I nicely warned the staff that if they didn't update at least twice a day with pictures or videos of my beast breathing, I would assume that my dog was dead like Green Acres and start a one woman Ferguson Riot of my own. Mirna and the staff made sure she always had one on one enrichment and training and made sure to constantly upload the Facebook so I could breathe a little easier while I was away. \n\nWhat was probably the best part? My dog didn't come back home smelling like she came from the mighty St. River of Dog Pee. I used to hate that I had to give my beast a bath after Gilbert Dogs because she smelled worse than a skunk but she smelled so great I almost cried tears of joy as I smuggled my face into her fat rolls. \n\nDefinitely give it a try! They also offer Veterans discounts so yay!
1713	1	a	Alice's Attic is a new addition to this corner, but it's right next to Alice's teen center, which offers music lessons to the community. The Alice I'm talking about here is none other than Alice Cooper, who has gone from hard core rocker to hard core charitable dude and positive addition to the community! Alice's thrift store is just that--secondhand stuff, all proceeds go to the teen center. It's full of your average secondhand clothes, dishes, books and furniture.\n\nIn the back there's a special shelf full of stuff Alice Cooper has donated. Mostly shirts and hats. Some of it is even signed! There is also a nice video playing about the music center. I would come back here for Alice Cooper stuff! Or furniture, which was all decent quality and well priced. The staff was also very nice and helpful. Next time you're in a thrifty mood, check it out. It's for a good cause. And Alice Cooper's gently used baseball hats and tshirts sounds like a great gift idea to me.
1714	0	a	I like the idea, but many overpriced...non collectors items. Maybe more marketing for high quality funky donations would help success. \nNeedless to say I didn't find anything I wanted. \nI would love to see this thrift store succeed, because of the good work it does as well as I just love Alice.
1715	1	a	Really excellent baked goods! I live around the corner and I'm waiting for them to open this morning so I can go get my sweet fix. They were very nice and helpful when I went in. All of the offerings were extremely well decorated. Highly recommend.
1716	1	a	I followed my colorist from his previous salon and am so glad that I did - once you find a colorist you trust you follow them anywhere! Jason is AMAZING with color. I have all over platinum, which is deceptively difficult, and only trust Jason with my hair. I even have other hair are professionals asking where I get it done. \n\nThe salon is centrally located in Tempe off of Mill Ave. and has super close parking. \n\nDo yourself a favor and book with Jason and Shelley, you won't be disappointed.
1717	0	a	so today i was recommended by a Coworker that this place was a great place for shopping for a birthday present for my aunt. When I got to this place I was amazed how colorful the bags are and what a unique concept. So a few minutes shopping and I noticed I was the only one in the store. no workers or even shoppers. immediately I thought I was on a reality show either im going to get pranked or get spooked on. so 15 mins in I was ready to get checked out and not a single worker of this store on site. A few mins passed and finally a female worker comes out very angry. The lady didn't say hi just rang me up and went back to her office. I never experienced anything like this but I found it amusing.
1718	1	a	Went here for the first time yesterday and was very impressed. Used the drive through and had the interior cleaned and wheels dressed. Luis was amazing!!!! He's very detailed and takes him time to make sure everything is cleaned to perfection. I've never had such a great car wash for $15.
1719	0	a	"Went to get a smog check and failed because my check engine light was on... I had no idea that in the State of Nevada that it was an automatic \""No Pass\"" if your check engine light is on. Not only was the guy unfriendly, he was rude when he demanded the money as if I wasn't going to pay him & immediately told me the test failed after I handed him the cash. The people at Terrible Herbst on Flamingo were very helpful to try and assist me with the issue. I WILL NEVER AGAIN GIVE A DOLLAR OF MY MONEY TO THIS OASIS BUSINESS AGAIN! Not even for a car wash!! I'll go to Terrible Herbst instead!\n\n*I know it's \""illegal\"" for a smog tech to say anything to you, but I find it strange that the reasons you can fail are Posted all over the Nevada DMV site, but the smog techs are not allowed to mention what is openly posted on the web. What sense does that make? It's public information. I still refuse to do any business at Oasis since the guy was unfriendly & rude!"
1720	1	a	Awesome place!  Brand new bar at Sahara and Valley View near CVS and Office Depot.\n\nAll of the bartenders, the servers, and the manager are friendly people.  They have a huge selection of craft beers on tap plus all of the usual liquor.\n\nThe food is among the best you will find in Vegas and the prices are great also.  Tonight I had the pastrami egg rolls which were unbelievably delicious, and a cheeseburger which I loved also.\n\nCheck this place out, you will not be disappointed!
1721	1	a	I just love this place. Great staff great food and 52 craft beers on tap. What a great addition to the neighborhood. A must visit bar.
1722	1	a	The Bf & I invited a few friends and decided to check this place out. The place was a little hard to find, kind of hidden in the corner, but definitely worth the effort. \nGreat, extensive beer list. I really liked the kronenbourg 1664  Blanc with 5% alcohol. I also liked the beer content being in the menu. Plus they have Titos vodka... Yay!! \n\nThe spicy calamari was amazing. I only wish there was more of it because it was so good! The seaweed underneath complimented it perfectly. I also ordered one of the burgers, without a bun. Very flavorful. They were a little stingy on the fries, but since the bf kept stealing them I can't really complain too much. I think they were just so good that I wanted more of 'em. Yummy in my tummy! \n\nService was excellent, bartender Kristyne is friendly and fun. I wish this place was closer to my house, but either way I'll definitely be back. It was a Friday night, and the place was pretty busy. Good quality of people.
1723	0	a	"I want to love this place!  It's near my home and I love their  beer selection.  52 beers on tap you can't beat that . The problem is the food is terrible.  The burger has pork belly ground in leaving the burger greasy and excuse my French sh****! The fries are an inch to an inch and a half long leaving them too salty and when you dip them in ketchup your fingers have to get wet with the sh**** fries every time. I asked the manager what is good on the menu and he said \""to be honest with you nothing is that good\"" .  The truth hurts. I don't want to bad mouth the pub I want to love, but this is definitely a work in progress. Beer thumbs up, food thumbs down!"
1724	1	a	The bartenders are great, the atmosphere is laid back chill, the food is delicious,  the machines are hot and the 50+ beers are ice cold!! 'Nuff said. Dont believe theres a bar that cool? Go see for yourself!
1725	1	a	Great selection of beer and alcohol. NFL package on deck. Great eats.. Oh, and if you like to degen, they have video gaming. Even better, a system to play your own music and listen to your own TV that your game is on. Getting it right. Support
1726	0	a	"Beer selection is great and reasonably priced.\n\nWe ordered the calamari and the rueben egg roll, both $9. The food was very flavorful, but not much for the price. It was more \""bistro\"" trend than bar or normal restaurant servings.\n\nFood was put down and I had to wait for silverware. My drink was empty when the food arrived and I was not offered another until the plates were cleared. The bartender did not ask how anything was and passed us multiple times. I tried to get her attention with no luck.\n\nI might try this place again in a few months once they work a few things out. Was really looking forward to going and ended up very disappointed!"
1727	1	a	This bar is a hidden gem... Somewhere to definitely meet up for a quick bite and to watch sporting events. I am very happy to have found this place. Amazing service that can deliver knowledge on the quality of beer and food selection. Phil the bartender is my fave.. He always recommends the best beers on draft.
1728	1	a	I had a blast here the other night played darts with my friends. Drank some really good Joseph  James  Citra Rye Ale  got a free glass! Started getting hungry and I ordered the burger oh man oh man it was so juicy . I have never had a burger like it in my life.
1729	0	a	I have been to Rebel Republic a few times and found the staff to be okay, they often leave you unattended for long periods of time.  I also noticed they would run out of food from the already limited menu.  Overall not impressed with this location
1730	1	a	We stopped by for Sunday burgers and my husband wanted PBR on tap ( no sampling of the 52 other beers but note they also have 2 NA beers). We had 10 TVs in our sight, great server, delicious food and plenty to drink!  The calamari was tender inside a flavorful breading and the seaweed was a terrific complement.  One juicy burger, one pork tenderloin that was a crispy crust around a thick cutlet, and yummy fries.  We will be back !!
1731	1	a	Best damn sports bar in Vegas! 52 craft beers on tap and fantastic food. The Reuben egg rolls are the perfect accompaniment to a nice cold IPA. Great game day specials and Lacey and Missy are the best damn bartenders around. 16 TV's and all the games on. Love this place!
1732	1	a	I came here last week and ordered Kobe beef sliders and a beer. I would probably come here just for the Kobe beef sliders. They were so flavorful and I loved how the meat was formed into a crispy meatball. They also have an extensive selection of beer which I love because I've been getting more and more into beer lately! The waitress that helped us was very friendly and made a lot of recommendations for our beer/food selections. My boyfriend ordered a burger and fries and they ended up giving us two baskets of fries, just so we could both try them out. I really liked the texture of the fries and the fact that they were very thin and crispy, but they were a little too salty for my liking. I feel like that isn't usually how their fries are though since a lot of people say the fries are BOMB in their reviews. \n\nAfter we ate, the waitress recommended we check out the other side of the bar where they have dart boards. We grabbed some darts from the bartender and started playing. I definitely need some more practice, which gives me more of an excuse to come here!
1733	1	a	So many things to like about Rebel. I can't give it 5 stars because of the smoke. It's too much to ask to drink my Lagunitas Born Yesterday without secondhand smoking a dozen cigs but such is life. \n\nThe things they do have going for them though, are going splendidly. They have a great selection of taps and they usually have something new to try when I pop in. If they blow a keg of your favorite brew, never fear, chances are they have something equally good to replace it with. \n\nI'm not a huge fan of bar food so there aren't a ton of options here for me to chose from. I eat the fries. As far as french fries go, these are decent. They're fat steak fries not the annoying shoestring version. The fish tacos are a good option too but they aren't listed on the menu so I'm not sure if the tacos are there to stay. \n\nThe bartenders (a few of them at least) recognize me, which I like. They know what I drink and greet me with a sample if they have something new on tap they think I might enjoy. Cool. Go for the beer, stay cause the people pouring it are pretty cool.
1734	1	a	"I found out about this new little bar in an article \"" Top Ten Bars In Las Vegas\"". I was looking for something centrally located, off the strip with a great beer selection, decently priced, good food, and an enjoyable setting. This place exceeded my expectations! The beer knowledge of all the staff alone blew me away! The selection is impeccable. I have been searching high and low for New Belgium's Lips of Faith series La Folie ( a Brown Sour) and they have it on tap!!!! I had the BBQ sliders. Wow! The food was delicious. The presentation, the bold flavors, and the fact that their meats are slow cooked and smoked in house. I can't wait to try them all! Katy and Larry took amazing care of us and I will be returning on a regular basis! These guys did it right. Must check this bar out!"
1735	1	a	I hardly drink, but when I do, its  Rebel Republic!  Very nice place, great food, excellent bartenders.
1736	0	a	"I rarely write reviews and when i do...it's either i really really love you...or really really dislike you!!!\n\nFood: it was not bad...when they brought out my fiance's calamari, i thought it was chicken wings at first coz it was shaped odd (like a surfboard, instead of the strips/rings that im used to)...for $9, i expected a bigger portion. Good flavors, otherwise.\n\nThe korean bbq sandwich gets a thumbs up for me. \n\n$5 for a teeny kobe beef slider...really?\n\nMy fiance got one of their burgers (the Eastwood) and was not impressed. For the price we're paying, we're better off at Bachi burger. My fiance was not thrilled with the \""meh\"" burger so he was just nibbling at it. (since he did pay $13 for such a mediocre entree)\n\nI ordered a side of sweet potato fries. Our server/bartender Missy gave me regular fries instead and i pointed that out to her and she said she'll bring me the correct one....and i've never seen those fries for the rest of the night\n\nThis was our first stop of the night and it was cold outside and a bit chilly inside...so the kicker of it all was when Missy knocked a full glass of Dr. Pepper on my fiance's lap. Imagine, in the dead of winter, having an icy beverage spilled all over your jeans and you have plans to go later!!!! The busser was kind enough to mop the floors and apologize profusely.\n\nSo nearing the end of our meal, my fiance was the only left slowly munching on his mediocre burger. He was distracted talking to our big group of friends so tell me why Missy takes his burger and fries away without asking him!!! When she came back, he told her he wasnt done and she said \""i saw napkins on top of it and thought you were done\"". Liar! There wasnt any napkins of top of his burger. I saw her put a dirty napkin on top of it and took it away!\n\nShe apologized and offered to grab him another burger or take it off the tab.\n\nMy fiance works in the restaurant biz so instead of Missy telling the manager the issues we've been having at our table, we had to flag the manager down to complain! Why wasnt this automatic, Missy?? You should let your manager know when there are issues IMMEDIATELY because the you want to please your paying customers!!!!\n\nSo when my fiance explained to the manager what happened, tell me why this manager says, \""What would you like me to do about it?\""\n\nAs a manager, you should first, apologize then say something like \""let me take that off your bill\"". Why would you ask the customer what you want them to do? Dont you think it's embarrassing if the customer tells you...\""oh, you take that off my bill\"".....The right thing to do is tell the customer that u'll take it off immediately, especially considering all the cr*p that happened to us. (my fiance told me this is what their managers do for their customers to keep them happy & for them to come back at his restaurant. )\n\nThe crowd: Tell me why our friends were the most diverse ppl in that whole restaurant??...i think majority of the crowd that was there saturday night were bikers and dudes wearing swastika, neo nazi shirts.....not cool if you have a crew with black, asian and hispanic ppl....but then again, we probably just went on a cr*ptastic night.\n\nFor a better variety of beers and fantastic food at reasonable prices (esp during their happy hour)...ur better off at Yard House!\n\nOk...enough of my PMS...\n\ntime for a donut.\n\noink"
1737	1	a	Rebel is the Top Craft Beer Bar in the entire Las Vegas valley. Having been to over 90% of the bars and clubs in Las Vegas, in my profession, I have seen the best and the worst among Vegas Bars and Wannabe's. \n\nFirst Off, having the most knowledgeable in their Craft(PUN intended) and being certified at that, also not being so bad on the eyes, the Beer Slingers at Rebel are SECOND TO NONE! Just an example, Wendy, having a following the size of some local bands, has been know to cause riots due to the crowds of beer-lovers and Gamers that follow her. She knows her shit and can run with the Big Dogs, so don't underestimate her talents.\n\nThe food, yes somewhat on the pricey side, but then you are not getting frozen, pre-made crap that you get at other bars. You are getting scratch-made, gourmet bar food with a twist. You dont come to a Craft Beer Bar for the cheapest Beer available and you should not expect the cheapest food to go with it. If you want $2 Miller 64's and frozen/fried cheese sticks or poppers, I suggest PT's down the street.\n\nIn the 15+ years that I've been in Las Vegas, testing, critiquing, and everything else when it comes to Food, Bars, Nightlife, etc, I've seen Bars come and go in every part of the city. this location in particular has been a Doc Holidays, I believe a Loose Caboose or something similar and about 3 other things that have gone under in the time that Rebel has already been here. You can tell as soon as you walk in the door that there in a quality product here. There is no cheap decor and neon beer signs, everything is up to snuff and the people behind the bar have the same quality. You dont find Certified Craft Beer Bartenders at every corner Pub.\n\nThis place is going to be here a while!
1738	1	a	Tried the siu mai and bubble tea from here.  The siu mai was very good and each one was probably double normal size with a nice big shrimp on top. It seemed to using more meat than fat, which is not so common these days.  I also had the lychee bubble tea.   While there wasn't much lychee flavour, it had less ice than normal plus a strong tea flavour.  I actually quite enjoyed it. I would call it a blend of HK style tea (served cold) with tapioca and lychee. It was quite good (and popular as there was a lineup of 10 people when we arrived).\n\nOverall, if you are into food trucks, I recommend you check these guys out.
1739	1	a	Definitely worth the price\nOne of the most Reasonable priced truck with delicious food.\nTried their best seller, their shrimp and pork dumplings and it was incredible.\nLooked more like 2 gigantic meatballs but amazing food for price\n\nHighly recommended for next season
1740	0	a	its a dim sum mobile, how awesome is that? apparently, they forgot the awesome part of a dim sum mobile.\n\nits quite underwhelming. in terms of taste, its pretty bland for what you're paying and you only get one for each hand (so 2). thank god, its only 2 but at the same, i'm still quite hungry after this.\n\nit needs some love from the old lady pushing the cart!
1741	0	a	Delivery? Not unless you live within walking distance! This Jimmy Johns only delivers within a MILE radius, and the customer service sucks. Not a great idea to come to San Tan Valley and offer delivery, and then limit it to a MILE radius.
1742	0	a	Save your time and money. Sandwiches were bland at best. They offer no kids sandwiches nor will they customize a order to suit a child ( add lettuce and mayonnaise to a four dollar sandwich that comes with bread and meat only) All they had to say as well that's corporate for you. Apparently they're so freakishly fast because they cut every customer service corner they can. I personally will never step foot in a Jimmy John's again and I highly recommend you do the same.
1743	1	a	I work in the downtown area and order Jimmy John's a few times a week. Their sandwiches are delicious and so fresh. The delivery is very fast, and the people that work here are very nice. Always a great experience with this location.
1744	1	a	Amazing burgers! Left us wanting more. Meat was extremely fresh and the burger buns were soft with a toasted outside. We also had the ice cream sandwiches which were fantastic. All and all, great experience.
1745	1	a	"Came here opening day last Saturday! Located on the left side of the casino if you're coming in from the main entrance of the SLS Casino. \n\nParty of 3 lunchtime wait was about 45 mins. Leave your name & # w the hostess, get your gambling on, & they'll txt you when the table's ready. \n\nCocktails are $13. The mule that I ordered was alright. Seeing that it was opening day, I'm sure the kinks will be tweaked out. \n\n\nOrdered the Royale ($15). Consisted of braised short rib, truffle aioli & truffle cheese on a med-rare burg. Taste and consistency were pretty on point from my usual go-to locations here in LA. Never had the short rib before so that was a nice tasty addition. Sweet potato fries ($4) were good as well. They had all the sauces displayed out on a plate per usual w the small pho spoons. \n\nService was good. Each booth has a tv that in the future, you'll be able to request a channel change for a certain game I'm sure. Layout of the place is nice. Very open w a lot of tv's & a small lounge area in the middle of the restaurant that reminded me that there's an actual sports book in the restaurant. \n\n**PSA*** NO tots for at least a week!! Was very sad to find that out when I was there. Reason given from the waiter was that the training of the cooking staff had to be perfected before \""secret menu\"" items were brought out. That also means no burger special for a while too. \n\nOverall, it's your usual Umami burger restaurant w the sports book addition. Great burgers w a lot of other menu options as well. If you can't get to LA or NYC, this location will def get the job done for the Umami fix. ENJOY!!"
1746	0	a	"This is the third restaurant I have tried at SLS. I am a huge foodie and have searched high and low around town for the best burger. What is Umami up against? Fukuburger, Badger cafe, Burger Bar at Mandalay. These are all great burgers and all cost less. We ordered the \""Manly Burger\"" and an order of fried pickles. S O asked for regular ranch instead of jalape\u00f1o ranch for the fried pickles. Waitress said \""we don't have regular ranch\"". Ok, kinda odd at a multi million dollar new casino trying to impress but we carried on. The burger arrived and it was tiny! This is a freaking slider folks. The nerve of calling it \""The Manly Burger\""! Before I took my first bite I thought to myself for $14 this better be awesome for this price. It wasn't :( It was average at best. The fried pickles barely had any batter on them and tasted like warm soggy pickles. I got 5 pickle spears for $6! Come on guys, really? I have no problem paying high strip prices for a premium product (I.E. anything at the Wynn) but you gotta deliver a premium product. The waitress noticed we didn't eat the pickles and did take them off the bill. \n\nAtmosphere was ok and the service was good. I just can't figure out why people would pay these prices for micro servings that aren't amazing. \n\nGeneral lesson for SLS and any other new business. You can't charge ultra premium prices and not deliver 5 star food and service. I have now eaten at Cleo, Umami and The Griddle and I wouldn't recommend them to anybody for now. As a long time local I want The SLS to succeed. We need jobs and great showcase properties. Come on gang, pay attention!"
1747	0	a	It was okay... Nothing to get excited about. I love a good burger but this was just lacking in flavor for the price. The tempura onion rings were spot on though!
1748	0	a	Not very diverse staff and horrible service they should try and pick better employees, i will never go back. Food was ok i get better food at red robin
1749	0	a	I have been looking forward to this burger experience for quite awhile, and sadly I was let down.  We actually didn't even get our burgers.  Apparently they lost our ticket!?  Seemed disorganized from our arrival...  Twenty minutes waiting for a table in the restaurant, but noticed at least six tables wide open.   They will text you when your table is ready, which I think is cool.   Sat down, got the beverages in a pretty timely manner.  Fried pickles were tasty, full spears served with a garlicky jalapeno ranch sauce (too runny, but flavorful).   Then it just went downhill.  \n\nOur order of Cali Burger, Manly Burger and Manly Fries seems simple enought, right?   Well about 15 minutes after our pickle app, our fries arrived (very delish thin fries with beer cheese and bacon!).    Burgers should come out at the same time or shortly thereafter, right?   Waiting....waiting....fries gone... Have been there for an hour now....no burgers.  Got tired of waiting and just left frustrated.  Staff was apologetic, and Management offered to comp a full meal for us and our friends on the next visit, which I appreciate.   I'm not rushing to get back, maybe give it a month or more to iron out the kinks.
1750	0	a	"This is a sit down restaurant that I thought would be amazing since it's new, but my experience include a bunch of drunk guys next to us and very bad service.\n\nThe food took forever just for three burgers and it wasn't even busy. When we got our burgers, one of the orders was wrong. It's expensive for really tiny burgers. The lady also took my water and never came back with more water. Literally, they kept offering us free food to make up for their mistakes... it was pretty sad.\n\nI don't think I would ever come back for a \""better experience\"" as the waiter told me."
1751	0	a	I was really looking forward to this place. Heard great things about their Los Angeles location. It did\nNot live up to the hype. Ordered my burger medium and it was deliver cold. In addition we waited 25 minutes to be seated in an empty restaurant and couldn't get a booth even though they were all empty and everyone that got seated after us got a booth. Weird level of service. They better get their act together because we have many options for burgers that are actually good.
1752	0	a	"Horrible. Horrible service. \nWe're staying at SLS and decided to come here for lunch.. Wish we hadn't wasted our time. We come in, and it's not busy at all. We ask for a booth for 4 people, they seat us in a booth made for probably about 10. Huge table. Really? We asked for a smaller one but the hostess or whoever told us, \""Well they're all dirty so..\"" there were at least 5 dirty empty booths at the time so I asked if they could clean one maybe? Hostess seemed irritated that I god forbid even asked of such a thing.. and told us that if we wanted to wait that we could. .. ok.. \n\nSo we waited for them to clean the table. And waited. And waited. They finally do and we go to sit at the smaller booth, and one of the servers tell us \""uh, somebody is going to be sitting here...\"" we replied \""yeah, us.\"" Totally rude. Eh, whatever. \n\nWe get our drinks after waiting for at least 7 minutes for anybody to even realize we exist. From the busser. The server comes later to finally ask what we want. We order, and I'm watching the tables around us being sat.. at least 3 tables we all watched being ignored. Waiting at least 10 minutes to even get acknowledged. Are you kidding me?\n\nOne table ordered champagne, and the server didn't even know how to open the bottle. Had to take it into the back. The customers seemed confused. The people at those tables were still waiting to order food, looking around for anybody to help.. seriously there's so much to type but I can't even deal with writing the rest right now. Just irritating that customer service has gone down the CRAPPER."
1753	0	a	Was curious to try this restaurant, but should have taken the advice of previous reviewers and skipped it.  Service started out a bit slow and went downhill from there.  I had the original burger and hubby had the royale.  He said his was pretty good, but mine had zero flavor.  Thank goodness the fries were salty - at least it was some flavor!  Had to borrow the ketchup from the next table as we could not find someone to bring us any.  Our waitress didn't even come to check on us until we were nearly done.  Wasn't offered a refill on my tea until they brought the check.  The table next to us seemed to have issues with their experience as well.  For the money, there are far better places in Las Vegas.  Sticking to Bachi Burger!
1754	0	a	For starters I will say our service was great. Our server was very attentive ( even though she had too many tables to juggle). \n\nThe food and restaurant in the other hand was not a good experience. The food was decent but very small portions. A burger fries and drink plus desert still left me hungry. Not to mention way over priced ! $5 for a soda. The burger was decent but nothin to rave about. There are too many burger places in Vegas that are much better and most cheaper. I wouldn't waste your time with umami burger.\n\n\nI will say the ice cream sandwich was delicious though ! Even for $7
1755	0	a	"Terrible service, okay food, good drinks\n\nUmami Burger is basically a poor man's Bachi Burger, or a dressed up overpriced burger where you over pay because it is on the strip.  Combine this with a total lack of competent service, and you're in for a disappointing night.  As to the service, SLS apparently stands for \""Style, Luxury, Service,\"" but Umami Burger contorts that to \""Severely Lacking Service.\""  If you're local, eat at Bachi Burger before going to the SLS and you'll get a superior burger at better prices.  \n\nWhile I can appreciate that the restaurant just opened and it may be working out the kinks, the service was incredibly disappointing.  To top it off, a marketer for the restaurant went to the adjacent table to see if they were locals to give them information about local specials.  When we looked at her to catch her eye, she just looked at us, then ignored us, and walked away.  This was pretty much on par with the terrible service we also had from our server who had nothing but attitude and rarely came back to check on the table.  That said, the server was cognizant enough to smile and tell us that she hoped we had a great dining experience when she was dropping off the check.  \n\nUmami Burger, you just lost 8 customers who will never eat at  your establishment again.  From looking at the other reviews, it looks like you will be alienating your future customers.  At least you're consistent."
1756	0	a	We were so excited to try a restaurant at SLS. What a letdown. Terrible service. The waitress never came by the table after the food was brought out so we couldn't inform her that our burgers were cold and our orders were wrong. Our drinks hadn't been refilled at all. You'd think at $8 a beer they'd at least offer to get you another one. I know they're new, but at $15 a burger, they should have great service to compensate.
1757	0	a	Gross! Diva chefs won't accommodate minor requests .. All I wanted was different onions!!! Bland, tasteless and plain boring!\nWorst feeling.. Leaving a restaurant hungry
1758	0	a	"Terrible experience! This review is for the bar only. Came to the SLS on opening weekend. Went up to the bar that was facing the casino because there were too many people at the main bar. It wasn't too crowded but I stood there for a minute while the douchey bartender flirted with the girls sitting at the bar and poured them free shots. He took my drink order, told me one price then charged my card for a greater amount. When I questioned him he rudely stated \""Well I guess I just told you the wrong price.\"" After me expressing that this was not an acceptable answer he proceeded to say \""what do you want me to do, give you your money back?\"" Then pulled a few dollars out of his wallet and threw them at me. Having been to the SLS in Beverly Hills, I was definitely not expecting this type of service. I really expected better and hope that they improve."
1759	1	a	I'm familiar with this place from Los Angeles.  I had great service when I came.  They were a little out of sorts/ unorganized but it was opening weekend so I expected some hiccups. \nI like the burgers. The manly fries are killer. Ice cream sandwich with mint chip was good as well.  \nI'm sure you could probably customize some burgers to your liking if the menu items don't tickle your fancy.\nI will definitely come back.
1760	1	a	Great place to have a spectacular burger. Loved. Will be coming back!!!! Ask for Mandy, one of Vegas top 10 servers!
1761	0	a	I'm not a fan of Umami when I tried it a few times in L.A. years ago. My sister has never been and I can't say no to a free meal with family. You have to reserve a table (what?) or open-seating at the bar. I'd much rather stay at home and do homework than be here but since my sister already went out of her way to reserve a table, I showed up anyway.\n\nRandom thoughts: their house ketchup tastes like Filipino spaghetti; you only get 3g or protein per 100g (1 cup) of mushrooms which does not meet my protein needs therefore, I must stick with beef patty; I have low expectations of Umami Vegas thanks to Umami L.A.; Umami beer garden???; Umami buns look huge but press to deflate; they'll give you 4 different sauces: 1 spicy, 1 ranch, 1 garlic aioli that doesn't taste like garlic at all and house ketchup.\n\nThe Original:\nHouse ketchup, parmesan frico, shiitake mushroom, roasted tomato and caramelized onion. The frico adds crispness to an otherwise boring burger. 3/5\n\nThe Royale:\nBraised short rib, truffled aioli and truffle cheese. Again, not truffle-y enough. The short rib was a nice touch. 3/5\n\nTruffle Burger:\nTruffle cheese, truffled aioli and truffle glaze. Sounds like a lot of truffle but it sure didn't taste like it. It had a hint of truffle and that's it. 3/5\n\nTruffle Fries:\nI've had way better truffle fries elsewhere. The fries were soggy and lacked truffle flavor.  Get the smushed potatoes instead. 1/5\n\nSweet Potato Fries:\nSprinkled with sweet salt. This goes well with the spicy dipping sauce and the house ketchup. 3.5/5\n\nMies Vanilla Rohe:\nTahitian vanilla bean ice cream in between chocolate chip cookies. The cookie itself wasn't that great. The ice cream was ordinary. Hello, cavities! 2.5/5\n\nAt least in L.A. I've gotten better service, food was a bit quicker and my drink glass was never empty. Umami is a casual dining place but calling it a sports bar/beer garden and having that atmosphere is just blah. Flat screens everywhere with different football games on and Criminal Minds = headache! There are other better burger places in Vegas.
1762	1	a	I don't understand why this place got horrible reviews! Since we stepped in, the service was over the top. Our waitress was very friendly and takes her time to explain the menu. \n\nI ordered truffle fries and cali burger. I fell inlove!!! I love the unique taste. Makes me want more and more! Our glasses of water never got empty. \n\nFor dessert we had salted caramel and peanut butter ice cream sandwich. Both were very good! \n\nI will definitely come back!!!!
1763	0	a	Ordered to go and they had you wait standing by the reception desk,\ndidn't even offer you to sit down..waited for 1/2 hour standing.\nMy daughter was disappointed for the small burger she ordered.
1764	1	a	I was lucky enough to have Umami Burger via Room Service, so I can't really speak to the service. As for the delivery guy, he was super friendly, and the food came quickly.\n\nI ordered the Truffle Burger Royal (the one with the egg on top), the sweet potato fries, and the pickle platter.  Everything was just the right size, not too small, and not too large where you feel like death afterwords.  The fries were a little cold, but delicious. Really delicious.  Plus the temperature was totally forgivable, given the fact that I was able to enjoy them in the privacy of my hotel room.\n\nI found the burger to be something truly special, and would order it over, and over again if I could.  The meat was perfectly cooked, the egg was perfectly runny, and the compilation of ingredients was quite spectacular.\n\nThe only reason I can't give Umami Burger 5 stars, is because much like other people, I found the ketchup to be pretty gross.  I don't understand the reason for that exact recipe, or consistency, but I felt like it actually took away from the meal, rather than added to it. I'm a pretty big stickler for ketchup, so I really hope they decide to go another route.
1765	1	a	"Umami: \nnoun\na category of taste in food (besides sweet, sour, salt, and bitter), corresponding to the flavor of glutamates, especially monosodium glutamate. ???\n\nI wasn't sure what Umami meant, so my assumption was that this was going to be an Asian fusion burger. Nope, this is just a straight up burger with truffle oil randomly thrown in the mix. C'mon, you were thinking the same thing when you heard the name, \""Umami Burger\"". \n\nI came here with some friends and we started this meal off with a cornucopia of deep fried, carb loaded appetizers, Mmm Mmm my favorite. First up, the \""Smushed Potatoes\"" these were ok, but a tad flavorless. They look like a mini-baked potato and be careful when eating, I tried putting a whole one in my mouth and nearly lit my tongue on fire. These little pockets of heat are best cut in half and dipped in Umami house ketchup, which I liked a lot. It's ketchup, but with a mix of truffle oil and something spicy. We also ordered sweet potato fries and tempura fried onion rings. The sweet potato fries were cooked perfect, crispy and soft and the tempura coating on the onions was light, flaky and not too heavy. Overall, deep fried goodness. \n\nOn to the star of the show. I ordered the Truffle Burger, the hat trick of truffle oil infused beefy eats. This burger has; truffle aioli, truffle cheese, and coated in a truffle glaze. This burger was super juicy and full of flavor and honestly didn't need any sauce assistance, but I still dipped it once or twice in a mixture called, \""Diablo Sauce\""? Plus the bun was super soft, like dissolving in your mouth soft. Cute side note, they adorn each bum with the letter, \""U\"" which in the words of Ralph Wiggum stands for, \""Umm-believable\"". After the burger entered the equation I completely forgot about the side dishes and went full carnivore. \n\nTo finalize the meal, like any good eater, we ordered and shared a dessert. This was an Ice Cream Sandwich. A snicker-doodle cookie with caramel ice cream filing. Sooooo good, a must order! \n\n- Was this the best burger I ever had? Nope. \n- Was it tasty and satisfied me? Yes\n- Would I come back? Maybe. Every once in a while. \n\nUmami is good, but the prices are a little high for a burger place, but If you haven't been here yet it's definitely worth a try if you're any kind of burger loving American. \n\nCheers."
1766	1	a	I don't know what's these other morons are doing talking about customer service it's a burger place.....  It is new....happens to be in the sports book with a good patio/beer garden area, and I had by far the best french fries ever, the truffle fries....and one of the better burgers I've ever had ....and it's tough for me to say something is better than burger bar but my Royale burger with short rib on top just is right there, I will go back and I will give the burger another try because it was as good as it was today it's by far the best burger I've and made me write my first review it was that good
1767	0	a	Terrible service, cold food, nothing compared to Bachi Burger. Sweet potato fries are cold and soggy, and the manly burger tasted like it was sitting out for 20min before they brought it out. The only reason this place gets one star is because they have decent beer.
1768	0	a	First time here and it's so loud you have to yell across the table if you want to talk also you can't hear the waitress and they can't hear you very poor atmosphere, probably will not come back I don't like that I have to yell just to talk at dinner. Very disappointed for my first time here.
1769	0	a	Not worth the money.\nThis was the first place I found to eat when my husband and I got to Vegas and I was starving!  Issue one was it was $12 for just a burger, and fries or any other side that would normally come with the burger at any other place was a seperate cost. It took forever for the food to get to the table and when it did my burger was missing the Portobello mushroom.  It took me several mins to find anyone who noticed me to tell them about the mistake and by that time my husband had finished his burger. When i showed them about the mistake they pointed out two tiny black chunks and said that was the Portobello and it just comes with one mushroom... this was highly insulting so I explained i wasn't going to pay $12 for a burger that didn't come as ordered so she went in the back and brought out 2 Portobello mushrooms. The burgers them selves are nothing to write home about, honestly I could get a better burger at red robins or fuddruckers and pay less. Due to the issue the waitress comped our drinks which was really nice.
1770	0	a	Bad, bad , bad! The burgers tasted frozen, the fries came out cold . The atmosphere was amazing but the quality of the food is some of the worst I have ever had. The allacart menu runs the ticket up. Which would be perfectly okay if the quality of the food matched it's price tag. 50 dollars later we couldn't believe we were paying for what we just had.
1771	0	a	I wanted to like this place, because it's a very nice place to watch a game, with plenty of TVs and good view lines.\n\nBut... the food!  Just not good enough.  The burgers are missing a key ingredient - taste!  Really overpriced, and the chef needs to figure out where to locate the seasoning.\n\nLastly, I don't think the waiter every made eye contact with the group.  Flying around, all sweaty and gnarls.  I have been rushed out of nicer burger places (read: In N Out).\n\nGo for the game and a beer, leave before the burger arrives.
1772	0	a	would have stayed to eat but game was so loud couldn't hear waitress talk. no dumb to scream at everyone at table. turn it down!
1773	0	a	The sporting environment and TVs are nice and the outside seating area. That is all! Drinks are overpriced unless you like beer. I came to watch a football game and they don't have happy hour for the games. Beer only. Burgers are overpriced and average.
1774	0	a	Another trendy burger joint in an image, fad following Hotel. To say this is another dime a dozen burger joint is spot on.\n\nAs a local, and a foodie in Las Vegas I don't usually subscribe to reviews that I read about restaurants until I experienced it myself. Well, apparently the reviews on this place are spot on. All I have to say is save your time and money and go to Bachi burger for a Wagyu burger for the same price as the smaller truffle burger you get here. Minimal flavor, and the portion sizes are very small. Much better quality at Bachi and the truffle fries are much to be desired. Also I could use a little less of the football Mongoloids at the sports bar. If we don't keep them honest they're are just going to keep churning out mediocre burger joints.\n\nI posted the burgers from this restaurant as well as Bachi burger, and you tell me which one looks better.
1775	0	a	I was really disappointed!\nI had the Cali Burger. The meat patty was good, nice taste and quality. The rest of the burger was terrible. The roasted tomato is so wet it made the bun soggy and mushy. They do not have fresh tomato, fresh onion, or pickles...... this is a burger place, right?\noh yeah, no regular ketchup or yellow mustard either.... you better like the unami sauces.... those are your only options here.
1776	1	a	Back at Umami watching my LIONS whoop up on the Jets! This is such a great place to watch the games and hang out outside w drinks and great food!! SO GOOD!!! Everything's coming up Lions today!!
1777	0	a	Customer service was rude, food took over 60 minutes, still didn't come out \nSO WE WALKED OUT \n\nWarning:: MENU IS DIFFERENT THAN UMAMI BURGER IN LA!\n\nHad FOX news on blaring over what was supposed to be GAMEDAY. \nFox News guys really?!\n\nAsked multiple times before they put the football audio on\n\n Didn't even bother to bring the appetizers before the food or refill water until the check came? What sense does that make? \n\n\n\nHORRIBLE HORRIBLE
1778	0	a	Although the server is nice the service is HORRIBLE.  Lost or forgotten orders from both the kitchen and bar.  For how over priced it is I expect better service.
1779	1	a	We had stayed at SLS and were too hungry to head to the strip and decided to try this place. I had the Truffle Burger and it was absolutely amazing!!!!! I seriously cannot remember eating a burger that delicious! The only downsize is the burger is a little on the small side, so if you're really hungry, it will not be enough. And for the price and size, the burgers do not come with fries or anything. I did order the Truffle Fries on the side which were also pretty good. Their fried pickles was okay. The pickles are huge spears, which is hard to share, would be better if they were cut smaller like in slices. Onion rings were good too, the batter was pretty tasty.\n\nThe service could have been better. Our server kinda had an attitude problem so we weren't thrilled with that, Honestly though, the food was pretty damn amazing. If the burger was a little bigger than a kids meal size and came with fries I would totally give it 5 stars! So because of that, I will give 4.
1780	1	a	Nice open atmosphere great for watching the games for the day. The cocktails I thought were really great. Very flavorful and creative. The truffle fries were nice so was the manly burger great flavor and plenty of bacon. My date had the truffle burger with the egg on it and she loved it. The ahi tuna burger could definitely have been better. The ahi tuna was flavorless and had an unnecessary amount of carrots on it. Service was decently quick and was actually extremely well priced. Would come back especially to watch the game on a Sunday.
1781	0	a	I was excited to come here. Not just for the burgers but for the beer garden as well. We ended up just going to the bar bc there was no hostess seating the half a dozen people standing at the door. We get to the bar and it takes 20 min to sample only 4 beers, which were all pilsner type beers so very limited variety. Their bottle selection was small with only a couple feesible options. The rest of their bottled beers are anywhere between $20-$50. I'm sorry but for just opening, the service sucked and so did their selection of beers :'(
1782	1	a	I don't know why everyone is giving such bad reviews...I went earlier today with my friend and all I can say is...THE BURGER WAS BOMB! Until now I'm looking at pictures of it..lol It was simple but the patty was juicy and perfect. My friends from Cali always talked about it so I was happy when we finally got one here. We made reservations a few days before so I recommend doing that especially if there's a game. Service was also good. She was very attentive and explained to us the menu and sauces. Overall had an awesome experience and will definitely go back..maybe next week..haha!
1783	0	a	"Located in the SLS hotel and casino. When you enter, to the immediate left there's what seems like a fully stocked bar with usual gambling games. To the right of that a comfortable area with tables and couches to dine or watch whatever sports game playing. The high ceilings has a black and white checkered pattern. And to the right of that their sports book with a few tables and tvs. But wait there's more. Exit the doors and you'll enter their \""beer garden\"" outdoor patio area with lots of seating, ping pong table, and an even bigger bar than inside.\n\nThe staff are very friendly and welcoming. They were patient enough to explain the items and what the concept of Umami Burger was each time.  They are supposingly a known business which I've never heard of and they prefer that you don't mess with the chef's creations and have them as is . It seems a like a place to hang out at and have some beers but I wasn't impressed with what I ate. \n\nKorean Style Brat http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/umami-burger-beer-garden-and-sports-book-las-vegas-2?select=EXZKbmaYdCoXrn7spPRf-g#EXZKbmaYdCoXrn7spPRf-g It looks great but I probably won't order it again. It was a pork belly brat topped with caramelized kimchi, their korean ketchup, sesame aioli, and green onion for $11. The pork belly brat was sliced like a hotdog bun it was thin and tiny in proportion to the other components.  It was like eating a bun filled with just caramelized kimchi. The caramelized kimchi was kind of nasty tasting for me, maybe too caramelized not sure but I needed lots of water just to finish it. \n\nManly Burger http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/umami-burger-beer-garden-and-sports-book-las-vegas-2?select=61-9mqfYzG0SuuOpy7DuNw#e-XzbnWpPTFtb9y9GM93FQ Their burger topped with beer cheddar, bacon lardons, smoked-salt onion strings, their house ketchup, and mustard all for $12. I don't know if I liked too much. The manly aspect wasn't there unless manly meant tiny. It was like an over sized slider.  I would've preferred the onion strings to be crispy. The U on the bun was nice.\n\nAlso had the Truffle Fries. Thin fries with truffle cheese and truffle salt. Didn't like it maybe try the manly fries or something else next time. The fries were cold and were all stuck to each other. \n\nI've had way better comparable food for the price in Vegas. I was expecting something on the line of Bachi Burger or at least better than 1/2 of the numerous burger places here but got something far far from that. Other than that I like everything else about it the huge misters, decorations, the bar, the many TVs, customer service, the outdoor patio with view of the Strip and people walking or driving along the Strip which is why I didn't give them a 1 star.\n\nI might be back."
1784	1	a	"I highly recommend the seared tuna burger.  It was sushi-grade tuna and it was amazing!  So tender, so good!  We also ordered the \""pickles\"" plate, which was a selection of different vegetables (mushrooms, carrots, beets, peppers, pickles, etc.) with different pickled flavors--different but good.  We got in late after all the buffets were closed, so we went here.  We were impressed."
1785	1	a	I finally got a chance to check out SLS. \n\nPros-Came here on Thursday night football, and WOW! They have like a 150 4K foot screen and it was beautiful! Surround sound was incredible. Restaurant is built different then what u expect but it was cool.  \nOrdered the manly burger because quite frankly I'm a man. Lol it was very tasty. Wasn't blown away by it but it def did the job. The sweet potatoes fries are INCREDIBLE! They add like brown sugar to them. It's heaven In your mouth! (Pause) lol\nServer was really sweet and pleasant. My burger didn't come out to the specific temp I wanted and they took it off my bill. I didn't even complain! That was a huge plus I just upped her gratuity . \n\n\nCons- good beer list but some of their beer was over priced. 12$ for a Octoberfest? 14$ for a Duval? That's ridiculous lol. Maybe more menu items in the future it was pretty limited. If you don't like sports don't come here during game time (I do love sports by the way) but it gets  pretty loud.\n\nOverall I'm glad I waited to come here. I will def be back!
1786	0	a	Regardless of the reviews, wanted to check out the hotel so decided to eat here since we were craving for burgers. Ordered the truffle burger, the ahi burger and the plain fries.  Got seated rt away but weren't approached immediately for orders, kinda got bored waiting....and they weren't packed.  Finally got our order and wasn't too pleased with the taste. I feel like it was missing something....!! Taste! Not worth the price. Beers were good, fries were good, but burgers from this burger joint are not. Needs improvement.
1787	0	a	Others may like Umami - I just don't.  I like a tasty basic burger - and I think sometimes - the more stuff they are piling on top - it's to disguise the fact that the basic burger itself is not very good.\n\nI ordered the Manly Burger, and I just didn't really like it.  I removed the bacon lardons cause they are just too thick for me to find appetizing.  The cheese is more of a cheese sauce, kind of runny and hardly any flavor.  And part of their thing is there is no lettuce or tomato or onion or pickles.  I'd rather eat at Smashburger or even 5 Guys for a tastier burger.  I did try the Sweet Potato fries, based on other reviews - and they were pretty good. Also, nice that you can get a beer - quite a large selection, and I think mixed drinks too. \n\nOur server was friendly and the food didn't take that long to arrive.  But the atmosphere here is also lacking, in my opinion.  It's like eating in the middle of a noisy sports bar - with TVs everywhere you look.  And if that's what you want - then that is great.  And then, also, with the Strip location - you are gonna pay way more than at any normal spot.  2 burgers, 2 sides, 1 beer, 1 pepsi, + tip: $50.00.
1788	0	a	Was very excited to take my lady here been hearing alot about this place. Tvs everywhere is the only nice thing. Got seated and almost took about 60 minutes  to get our food was ready to just walk out. Then no kids menu as well when you order the burger we were expecting fries or etc.  Nope its only the burger for $12 to $15 dollers. Food finally  comes out the burger tasted raw they didn't  fill up drinks or attend  to us. I was very happy to try it but now never again burger had no taste my lady  didnt even eat hers all and all the type of money i spent here IN & OUT BURGER 100% better and way cheaper umami burger needed taste n etc  was very disappointed  never coming back
1789	0	a	Unimpressed with their original burger and short rib style fries. The burger ju didn't tats that great. It was cooked nicely but the flavor just wasn't there. As for the fries, major letdown - soggy city. If it's gonna be soggy because of the gravy then the gravy should be decent
1790	0	a	Well this is an OK place. Nothing special in my opinion. The Burger are mediocre. The staff is nice and friendly. The Tv's are way too loud. We had to yell to each other. I was disappointed because they were not able to bring the correct beer. The first round was correct but after that they always brought the wrong beer. I mentioned it twice but they were not able to fix it. They made me pay for all beers. Not a good example of fixing a problem. Again this is convenient if you wanna get a quick bite while staying here. Holsteins has way better Burgers for sure.
1791	1	a	What can I say other then I love this place. Not just because of the great hand made food made to order but because when you're located in Vegas, you get sectional couches to relax on and tons of TV screens located throughout this fine location. Oh did I also mention that you can place bets on any sports games there while you eat. \n\nUmami burger is conveniently located with the beautiful SLS casino at the end of the strip. So because it's a new casino what better way to pull people in then to build one of the best burger joints to eat at. The layout of this place is awesome! The have a bar and bench area that overlooks the strip but puts you right in front of this wall size TV screen. That's almost every mans dream right there, to have huge burgers covered with truffle cheese sauce and a cold beer. \n\nI will say they also have extra dishes on there menu compared to the California locations. So that was a pleasant surprise. So the first time I was there I ordered there standard truffle burger, (I love truffles) so this burger was packed with flavor and a side of oozing and rich truffle fries. On day two I ordered the 12oz. double patty, caramelized onion infused B.U.B burger. If you're on a diet or squeamish, I suggest you not order this burger. It will keep you set for the rest of the day.\n\nSo when in Vegas or staying at the SLS, stop by umami burger. It's never let me down and hopefully it won't for you.
1792	0	a	More generous side order portions but such crappy service. Had to flag down workers for water, ask twice for sauces, forgetting drinks. Retrain your workers, maybe ask the people at the grove umami how to run a burger place. Good luck surviving.
1793	1	a	So today was our return back to umami burger with my ladies family from Los Angeles. We were well  taken care of Thanks to Rachel the General  Manager as well jeorge and Brooke  we loved you guys and thanks for everything.  My ladies family was very excited  to try it and were very satisfied with everything . I will definitely  come back our family has nothing but good things to say about umami. Once again  thank you so much i am so thankful for your concerns on everything. That just shows a business  that cares we will definitely  be back soon thanks for everything we weren't  expecting  that V.I.P treatment we love umami
1794	0	a	The ketchup tastes like it is very fresh and made by scratch, their jalape\u00f1o ranch dressing is tasty, not too spicy. The beet salad was excellent. My boyfriend got the original burger and I got the manly burger.\n\nI ended up sending mine back because I don't like the fondue type of cheese that came on it... Nor did I like the bacon lardons- they are too thick and not as tasty as real bacon. I was frustrated... I just wanted a bacon cheese burger with real solid cheddar cheese or solid pepper jack cheese on it. Unfortunately I learned that Umami does not have any solid cheeses. I decided the next best thing to get would be a Parmesan cheese crisp minus bacon lardons. The bun was cute with the U on it. At first I thought the burger quality was good but it just fell apart in my hands and started breaking... My boyfriend said it was because it was too juicy... Not sure but it made it very difficult to eat. I felt bad that I needed to send so many things back... \n\nEven the diet Pepsi because it tasted flat. So I got iced tea but there was no sugar on the table and it didn't come with a lemon. Our server was sweet but way too busy to check on us enough, perhaps due to poor staffing. There was indoor and outdoor seating. I loved the open layout with couches, our booth was comfortable, there were televisions everywhere for the sports fanatics. \n\nThe sweet potatoe fries were a little too sweet, like they had excess sugar on them. I am a sweet potato fri expert:)\n\nConclusion is that Umami in my opinion is better than a fast food burger but nothing compared to Hook (located in Woodland Hills). I thought Umami would be very similar in quality compared to Hook. If Umami used a pretzel bun my burger never would have fallen apart. If they used solid cheese and plane jane bacon I think they could accommodate more customer requests. I don't think I have extraordinary tastes when it comes to burgers.
1795	1	a	Was there Saturday night, sat outside. Took a little bit to get our drinks but after that they were quick. BEST SWEET POTATO FRIES IVE EVER HAD! Ugh, oh my god, mouth watering. And I got the salad with the tuna, delish! And the snicker doodle ice cream sandwich, so good! Just an excellent meal all around. I want to go back and have the exact same meal. Good job umami
1796	1	a	Foodwise, this was the best burger I've had in Vegas. We were staying across the street at the Hilton and after finding Unami on Bon Appetit's top 50 burgers list, I knew we had to roll over.\n\nWe came with a group of 8 and were easily seated outside at one of the picnic tables. Only disappointment with that is that we were seated on the far left side where there was no light. And it was bout 7pm and so it was dark. Would have been nice to be seated closer to the lit bar, or inside.\n\nDrink specials during football season are amazing and so our beer drinkers were very pleased. I had a tequila/ginger beer cocktail that was delicious and well worth its $13 price tag.\n\nFood wise, I had the cali burger and smothered fries. Everything was beyond delicious. The burger was thick and super juicy. I like the homemade american cheese and the caramelized onions were perfect. The smothered fries were heaven as the short rib was very tender and the gravy was super good. I had some of my cousin's beet salad and that was very good as well. \n\nService was my main reason for deducting a start as our server wasn't around very much. There would be long stints that she was gone, even though the restaurant was quite empty. She also quickly asked to process our check as she had tickets to a concert that night and wanted to leave as soon as she could. Made us feel really important.\n\nOverall, I would definitely return for the food and atmosphere. This time I'll know better to request not to sit at the far end of the patio and will cross my fingers that there are no concerts going that night.
1797	0	a	"SERVICE: Something is clearly amiss here. After ordering our drinks and food at the same time, we waited for 15 minutes as we wondered which would arrive first. After deciding that we would give them two more minutes for SOMETHING to arrive before walking out, our drinks arrived. Our server seemed frazzled but was very apologetic. The manager caught wind of our situation (or maybe he just saw the stopwatch running on my phone) because he came over to apologize as well. He offered us some \""complimentary sauces\"" to go along with our fries, but, not surprisingly, those never arrived. (And I was looking forward to those \""apology sauces.\"") Oh, and our check showed up before being asked if we were interested in dessert (which we were)! I guess they weren't offering any that night. Oh well.\n\nATMOSPHERE: It's difficult to tell where the sports book ends and the Umami Burger begins, but maybe that's the point. Either way, I can't say I enjoy eating while ESPN commentators scream in my ear about college football, but that's just me.\n\nFOOD: Not much to say here. The fries were okay and there wasn't anything all that offensive about the burgers, but nothing stood out. So, as Las Vegas locals with lots of other restaurants to try, we won't be visiting Umami Burger again."
1798	0	a	If I could give zero star, I would. Very unprofessional & unapologetic. Customer service was very unsatisfactory. \n\nCame here for lunch with my daughter while waiting for hubby to finish playing on the table..thinking I'd give this place a try after having read some reviews about the bad service. I requested to be seated at a booth considering my daughter always, and by always, I mean literally always manage to fall off chairs. We were explain that since I had my daughter with me, it's automatic that they'll seat us by the back booth because of the sports book. We were shown the way & guess what! 2mins upon having sat, I was told we had to finish ordering, waiting & eating by 12:30pm. Mind you, it was literally 11:54am!  Just coz a party was coming at 12:30pm to occupy the space where we were seated -- WHY HAVE US SIT HERE WHEN YOU WERE GONNA USE THIS SPOT IN 36mins! I don't work in the restaurant business but I think courtesy is a universal thing wherever & whatever field of work you do. I asked for specifics but no answer provided. NO APOLOGY EXTENDED. \n\nI had to LEAVE. I wished it would have been a better experience. Very disappointing. Sometimes it's not just the food that matters, QUALITY SERVICE means a lot to paying customers like me as well. You get more exposure by word of mouth especially if patrons get good service. Very disappointed.
1799	0	a	Don't believe the hype. I don't know maybe the one in California is way different and much better. \nThe layout was cool open concept, gets pretty loud since you can watch the game and  the sls sports book is inside umami. The service was ok, we had to flag the server down for some refills. Didn't check up on us frequently how he did his other two tables. \nFood was not the best! The burgers were plain no lettuce just meat, cheese, and a sauce. I got the the classic and it had a roasted tomato I felt like I was eating a meatball sub. The truffle burger was better but still plain. Fries got soggy real\nQuick, onion rings were over battered and soggy. The only thing I liked was my jasmine green tea. I did not feel like I got my money's worth. I spent $50 for nothing. All a hype. I won't return.
1800	0	a	Ordered a burger and fried pickles and decided to go down and pick it up instead of having it delivered to the room. 1) it was ready almost 30 minutes after I was told it would be ready. 2) they did not include the ranch dip with the pickles. When I called they said they would bring the sauce right up, but they never showed.  (surprise)  \n\nThe burger was ok, but a little dry. Not worth the hype. I would review the pickles but they got too cold to eat while I was waiting for the dip.
1801	0	a	I can surmise this in 2 words. \nFOOD POISONING - I ordered a turkey burger with avocado and sprouts. I should have sent the burger back when it was barely warm on arrival. After 12 hours of throwing up and a trip to the ER  I would never accept food that was not warm enough again in particular turkey and top it off with the hi contaminant possibility of sprouts.  In addition to the obvious poor quality and standard of food, the server seemed more like a bouncer -- Big burly not very friendly and plopped the plates down on the table. Three girls, 3 turkey burgers- one beer, one side of fries one side salad--  bill was $70!!!! The restaurant also has an identity crisis- it's part burger bar / part sports bar /part Vegas Casino but the food sucks and the volume in the entire restaurant was way too loud. All the games playing were volumed at Super Bowl status, when there were no big games on it was just a variety of college sports. These annoying, nonrelevant games were so loud and distracting that it was difficult to hear sitting at the same table with somebody. Even if I didn't get sick, I would probably never go back based on the server and overall atmosphere the restaurant being too loud in an unnecessary sort of way
1802	1	a	Yummy! The food was delicious. The service is semi slow but very friendly servers. I recommend sitting outside.
1803	0	a	Arrived and was seated swiftly. The wait person was quite nice and very attentive. The kitchen was very slow.\n\nNow, for the food. My medium hamburger was served raw in the centre and had to be sent back. After waiting an extremely long time to be served they obviously rushed the order and undercooked it. But that makes it all the more disappointing, because then I had to wait around again to get a properly cooked burger. (And let's be realistic, unless the meat is cut on the property, hamburger meat needs to be carefully cooked.) The fried pickles were excellent. The onion rings were obviously dropped into a fryer that was too cold since the batter was exceedingly oily and had little flavour and we only ordered them because so many people rave about them, only to find them almost a total disappointment that we didn't even want to eat.\n\nSo basically, good server, bad (slow) service caused by the kitchen. Disappointing onion rings and undercooked burger. What a disappointment... recommended by Thrillist, but maybe they haven't been here lately?
1804	0	a	"Concept restaurants are great and all, but you need to be able to execute without flaw to justify your ego. \n\nFOOD:\nI get that at the flagship location that you don't allow any substitutions on your menu. Good for them. When i ask for something different on my burger, I don't want to argue or have to debate Stanford's Debate Team. I want a, \""Sure thing!\"" and I understand I might get \""That's gonna cost you a couple bucks extra\"" at which point I'd say \""I'm worth it.\"" OR if you don't want people to make changes, then tell them and own it. \n\nAvoid the nachos and the pickle plate. The nachos were put on the menu because people were asking for it and even the manager understood why we were disappointed. Question: If the manager knows its bad why are you serving it. Issues: only a tablespoon of the braised beef accompanied a slave labor camp's output of chips with \""beer cheddar\"" \""fondue\"" drizzled on about 7 of the chips. \n\nThe pickle plate was also a let down. They obviously use a boiling method for the pickling and they over boiled the canned veggies. Carrots, mushrooms, beet, red pepper, an actual pickle and green beans. Pickling is an easy process, it just takes time. Why not just use better ingredients and something a little more exotic for your vegetable selection. Tried everything and pushed it away. Bachi Burger has a much richer pickle plate if you ever want one in Vegas.\n\nSERVICE:\nKinda touched on this already, pushy about their concept, but this location really doesn't have one so it comes off as misguided. Our server was nice, but I was noticeably unimpressed with her attempts to stick to her script of no substitutions even though this location allows them... and I think she was just not in the mood to have to put out energy to make the experience good for us so she gave us a lot of space... for a while. \n\nThe busser cleared our plates and even asked us how things were for the first time since we got our food and we were honest about how less than spectacular we thought it was. That guy winked at both of us about 22 times in the span of 30 seconds. It was magical, but not enough for us to change our minds.\n\nThe lead/manager/assistant manager/some guy with bill control powers came up and asked how our meal was, we were honest and he agreed that the nachos and pickle plate and the wings (he mentioned them, not us) should not be eaten here. He took those items off of our bill as we barely ate any of them.\n\nOVERALL:\nThere's nothing here that you can't find somewhere else, better and nicer. And if a place is gonna stick to its guns about no substitutions, then it better make sure EVERYTHING on its menu rocks hard the way it is. \n\nAnd one more thing: you need to be a litte more Johnny-on-the-spot with the channels on saturday afternoon during football. I don't watch football, but i sure as hell don't watch Judge Judy for 20 minutes or need it broadcast over every speaker in the joint while i'm searching for some nacho meat."
1805	0	a	There are two things I take into account when eating somewhere, the price of the food and the quality. I've heard a lot of good things about umami. However Vegas has a great rep for taking restaurants, franchising out to the strip and poorly executing it. I ate here and paid 14 for a burger and 6 for some fries. Price to me isn't a huge deal however to me the meal was not that great. The burger had no flavor, the fries were alright. However there are way better places you can go for a good burger on the strip.\n\n I will say that I usually have a bad experience with female servers and my server a bubbly blonde if I remember correctly, did however make the meal quite pleasurable. She was a great server and I will note that.
1806	1	a	I think there is a umani burger in NYC but never been and actually did not eat a burger while here though did try out there beers, and salad.  My friends stated burger were good.    I did like the outdoor seating in their beer garden area as nice to get out of the casino and relax especially during the cooler months of the year.  I was a little annoyed they would not plug in my phone as needed to charge it up at a plug by game table which was in a section one could not sit in.    Does not open at 10am when games start which is surprising since sports book is within its confines.
1807	0	a	After the reviews we were fired up to hit this place up when we rolled into town.  However......after ordering the Hatch burger and the truffle fries we waited forever.  When the food came both items were cold and uninspiring.  After about ten minutes we got the staff to pay attention to us.  We did get replacements for all and the second round of burgers were better.  The fries reminded me of gravy not truffle style, not sure what that was all about.  The 2 stars is due to the fact that they comped us the food.\n\nTIP FOR the PLACE - WARM up the hatch chiles so it doesn't take away from the heat of the burger.
1808	0	a	"SLS? Seriously Lacks Satisfaction.\n\nThis is no more obvious than at Umami Burger, destination for our latest foodventure. But foodventures are not always successful, as Umami (Japanese for something) would prove. When Mama R wanted a burger for her birthday, Emijandro and I found it as our opportunity to try the much talked-about burger spot at SLS and off we went.\n\nMy thoughts on SLS itself are... sub-par at best, but this review strictly focuses on Umami Burger, which we found along the wall fairly easily. Walking in, there was a very... recycled... feel to the place, which I thought was supposed to be an urban hipster sports bar vibe. But one glance at the CHECKERED FLAG CEILING ABOVE revealed they just gutted the NASCAR Cafe and didn't bother to redo the ceiling.\n\nWhen we were seated, we were handed small, trifold menus. Mine was dirty.\n\nSeriously, your F&B department could have printed a ton of those, but you're giving me a dirty one?\n\nMaybe it was to hide the fact that the basic burger was $12. No fries. NO GAWDANG FRIES. **flips table**\n\nI ordered the Manly Burger, without the beer-cheese (?) as I don't care for cheese on my burger. The (dirty) menu said it had \""bacon lardons\"" on it. \""Ryan,\"" you may be asking, \""what in the Sam Hill is a 'lardon?'\"" I didn't know either, but it's somehow related to bacon, so I took the risk ($$) along with an order of Tempura Onion Rings ($) and water (HAH TAKE THAT CORPORATE MURRKA!). Emijandro ordered the Jose Andres Burger ($$$) and Mama R ordered the basic burger. Well, basic according to Umami's standards.\n\nThe burger is an art form. I know. I'm a burger connoisseur. A burger gourmand, if you will. Its art is found in its simplicity. A patty made out of some meat, toppings-a-go-go, and a bun. Delightful. But at some point Umami just made it all too fancy-schmancy. First off, lardons are apparently cubed bits of slab bacon. I suppose that's fine, but some thick strips of bacon are just as tasty and probably less expensive for the restaurant so they can lower their prices. Secondly, would have liked some barbecue sauce on this type of burger (also had onion strings), not their Umami Ketchup (Japanese for something ketchup), which really was just ketchup, nothing really different.\n\nThe burger was too pink for my taste -- apparently my waiter heard \""medium rare\"" instead of \""medium please.\"" Or he was just dumb or hated his job -- the service was unsatisfactory, he spoke too quietly for a sports bar atmosphere during the third quarter of Monday Night Football, and dropped items repeatedly  (fortunately not our food). When we could hear him, he was being pushy about us ordering dessert.\n\nListen, dude, I know you're supposed to upsell, but when my bill is already about $19, don't give me a look when we say no to dessert.\n\nWhich I could have gone for, by the way, because for that type of money, the burger was small. To be fair, I didn't leave hungry, but I didn't leave with that OMG NO MORE FOOD IT WAS TOO GOOD kind of feeling. It just left me with a general MEH. I shouldn't leave with MEH for $19.\n\nA few positive notes: The onion rings were tasty, though I could have used a dipping sauce beyond the four tiny little ladles of sauce they provide, one being the Umami Ketchup (something ketchup), and one being HOLY CRAP MY BUTT WILL REGRET THAT TONIGHT kind of spicy.\n\nUmami should be Japanese for \""overhyped.\"" If you want the best burger on the Strip, it's still at Holsteins at The Cosmopolitan. Or stay off-strip and you can find a lot of high-quality burgers at a much lower price point. Either way, maybe SLS stands for Satisfaction Low, Sorry."
1809	0	a	"We came here for #SocialSundays when locals get 50% off the menu at a selected restaurant and obviously, on a Sunday. What a fabulous deal! I made a reservation through OpenTable and requested a table in their Beer Garden. The hostess couldn't find my reservation, but luckily, I resolved that through OpenTable. Fortunately, it wasn't busy yet and we were seated in our preferred area immediately. \n\nSide note: They're open an hour earlier (10AM) on Saturdays and Sundays during football season. If you sit inside, there's a $50 F&B minimum PER PERSON during the 10AM games. This does not apply to the Beer Garden though!\n\nThe Beer Garden is their outdoor patio facing Las Vegas Blvd. There are several televisions along the walls showing multiple games. The seating is picnic tables and very casual. There's also an entrance/exit to street, but you can't just seat yourself. It was a great atmosphere, especially with the beautiful weather that day. They don't allow smoking on the patio, but some patrons thought that hanging their arm off the patio railing meant that they were abiding. Yeah, no. The smoke was bothersome and off-putting.\n\nOur server was really nice and with supporting staff, everyone was relatively attentive to our needs. The manager was constantly walking around the restaurant and he was approachable. There was an issue where we were watching a particular game and it was switched abruptly (however, the audio remained on that game) and we spoke to our server and the manager to have it resolved. First, we were told by our server that they do not change the channels for anyone or any reason (Really?). Second, we were told by the manager that the games switch automatically during Half Time, however, the television did not revert back after the game had resumed the second quarter. It took approximately 15 minutes for the game to FINALLY appear! No explanation as to what occurred. I can't imagine anyone being happy if this happens often during big games.\n\nTruffled Beet Salad ($7): truffled ricotta, smoked almonds, wild baby arugula, and truffle dressing. The arugula was fresh. The truffle wasn't too overpowering. Overall, a decent salad, but nothing special. It's missing something - I didn't get that \""umami\"" factor.\n\nFried Pickles ($6): artisan-crafted pickles, jalape\u00f1o, ranch, and shaved Parmesan. The pickles were okay; still had a bit of crunch. The batter was light.  Nothing remotely worthy of a repeat.\n\nSmushed Potatoes ($4) with roasted garlic aioli. These were good. The potatoes were nice and soft inside while having some exterior texture. Their roasted garlic aioli is great.\n\nThin Fries ($3): Nothing special, but not terrible.\n\nUmamify Your Fries - Truffle 'Em ($3): truffle cheese fondue and truffle salt. This definitely made their boring fries much more exciting. Nothing I'd come back for though.\n\nHatch Burger ($11): Roasted green chiles, house American cheese, and roasted garlic. This was just okay. It wasn't cooked medium rare like we requested. There was nothing exciting or even good. I can barely recall its taste now.\n\nThe Original ($12): Parmesan frico, shiitake mushroom, roasted tomato, caramelized onions, and Umami house ketchup. This burger was terrible. The burger had no flavor and I didn't have anything remotely close to an \""umami\"" experience with it. Oh, and you know how it says you get \""shiitake mushroom\"" with your burger? Yeah, you really get only ONE mushroom and it had the circumference of half dollar coin! WTF?! How does that make any sense? Why wouldn't you slice the ridiculously small mushroom and attempt to distribute it on the entire burger? You get the experience of a shiitake mushroom, but only in one bite. You're SOL with the rest of the burger.\n\nSpanish Royalty Combo ($35): Jose Andres Burger and Estrella Damm Inedit. The Jose Andres Burger ($15 individually) has a pork and cured ham patty, piquillo pepper confit, caramelized onions, Manchego cheese, and roasted garlic aioli. The Estrella Damn Inedit (750mL; $25 individually) is a malt and wheat beer created by Ferran Adria and his El Bulli team in 2009. So, you save $5 with the combo. Thank goodness this burger was good! It earned the additional star. The patty was juicy and the whole burger was extremely flavorful (or maybe just in comparison to the other tasteless burgers). I was happy with this burger. Ruben enjoyed the beer very much.\n\nThe food was extremely disappointing. We've been to Umami Burger in California and really enjoyed it, so this experience was surprising. The burgers are much smaller than the ones we had there. Even the Smushed Potatoes are smaller! Everything was hit with a shrink ray when it came to Las Vegas. The sides were decent, but the burgers (the Jose Andres Burger being the exception) were offensive! Also, I'm not sure when you receive the soup spoons with dipping sauces, but we weren't offered!"
1810	0	a	This was my visit to SLS after much reluctance and disinterest on my part and it was even more lackluster than I expected. \n\nWe came to Umami Burger on a Monday night during Monday Night Football. The place was packed and loud, but we were seated quickly. The table was a little dirty and the sad little paper menus were stained, too. \n\nI ordered the Jose Andres burger and a side of fries to share with my mom. The burger was a good size, but I didn't like anything about it. The meat was only good around the edges and the texture was a stringy, fatty and greasy. The flavors were just not what I was hoping for and was incredibly bland. The fries were even worse. They were dry, overcooked and flavorless. \n\nI didn't enjoy a thing about anything I ate at Umami Burger. Even worse than the food was the service. Our waiter practically whispered every word to us and made no effort to speak up when it was clearly noisy from the football shenanigans happening around the restaurant. Refills were slow, condiments were in tiny portions and offered nothing to enhance the flavors of anything. \n\nI don't have any interest in trying this place again.
1811	0	a	Came in on a Wednesday night and sat inside, part eatery and Sports bar. I liked how each booth had a flat screen but there were flat screens and sofas if you just wanted to relax as if you're at home!\n\nI opted for a booth but had great views of the entire place for decent people watching. I started off with a cold green tea which was flavorless. My waitress who was there physically but mentally absent took my order for BBQ wings , onion rings and the  B.U.B burger. I specifically requested the wings first and others to follow later but within minutes after the wings arrived the other two items appeared. When the waitress returned and I advised her what happened and her reply was the kitchen was caught up!  The food was decent but I was pleased mostly with the wings. The onion rings were too large, under cooked and a few had too much batter. The burger which contained two large slices of beef, bacon bits and contained another slice of bread which I removed. The burger was overcooked and on the dry side. I was ready to order peanut butter ice cream but the absent minded waitress didn't even bother asking if I wanted dessert and just left me my tab. It's ashame an establishment put this much time and money into this business and yet they have such a sad and unmotivated employee interacting directly with clients. I made sure I tipped accordingly which I thought was still generous.\n\nCompared to my first experience outside at the Umami Beer Garden, this was a horrible experience. Such a disappointing dining experience. If I ever returned here, I will make sure and request not to be seated in the area of this waitress!
1812	0	a	Horrible service. Word to the manager reading this... If you have a line of people wanting to eat at your establishment, seat them, that's how you make money. Or tell them you have full service at the bar to the left of you. Rant over.
1813	0	a	"My review is specifically for the sports bar. This place blows! My friend and I went last night to watch some college basketball. We sat on the couch for about 20 minutes before I flagged down one of the several waiters that passed us by. We ordered French Fries (with truffles) and 2 glasses of wine. Fries came out first. No napkins, but 2 really pretty plates. The wine arrived about 10 minutes later. We asked the waiter of it would be possible to change one of the 4 TV's to the game we wanted to watch so it would be easier from a view stand point. We were told the \""Sports Bar\"" controlled that and he would ask. 5 minutes left in the game, the waiter came over with a remote and changed the channel. This place should be focusing on Unami Burger. The Sports Bar should be just that, a sports bar. You can't be everything to everyone and do it well! Bad choice SLS!!"
1814	0	a	"$9 Goose Island for this location, for a local and during an NFL game? Nope, we have too many other options! Hey SLS, you do know where you are located? Not exactly center strip eh?\n\nIt wasn't a good sign when the guy at the bar next to ya say \""good luck\"" after noticing the way were thirstily eyeing the bartender. So he gets an order of onion rings (not bad looking rigng BTW) and asks the runner for some catchup and the runner says \""sure, just ask the bartender and she'll get you some\"". Now maybe I'm becoming a stickler for service but he asked YOU for catchup not the slow ass BT. Bad form in a hospitality city like this.\n\nThat was our third time at SLS... $18 in two beers, thats three strikes and we are OUT."
1815	0	a	Service sucked !13$ soggy so also sucked. Sad I was looking forward to this place wonder why people rave about it. Stick to in and out...and they charge 20% tip so I guess service doesn't matter...
1816	1	a	Yup...I'm back!! Found out today, if there is a group of you and you are not super hungry....order a few burgers to share and taste, some fries and nachos and it is PERFECt
1817	1	a	I was there last Saturday afternoon and not only were the burgers and fries amazing but Mandy was the best server I have had. Very sweet and on top of it and very tentative. Highly recommend!
1818	0	a	Nothing Special , actually kinda dissapointed because i was expecting more decent food. Burger is so small and patties are cooked dry. I wouldnt pay $12 or more for a burger  just go to Gordon Ramsay Burger
1819	1	a	"Well talk about shocked only gets three stars...Or should say not sure why Umami not getting much yelp love except everyone has right too ones opinion. I feel that Umami Burger offer unique experience comes to watching games at a sports book. Trust me use to be one of those sports parley betting addict every weekend. Before realize the house always win. Lol. I can only think of handful of sports book that first off offers food more less quality food not just your normal fried everything bar food. Plus the ones that do offer food usually adjacent or may need to walk some ways get food then bring it back. Not like the sports books are made for food. The chairs made for parley sheet, drink, and sheet write down bets. If in front of small television booth in reality same thing. The thing about Umami literally you just walk up place bet (live betting; that new one for me) and go back too eat, drinking, or talking stories with friends. I came here watch MNF with friends visiting from the 808. I read reviews that need order certain amount on Sunday or on football days in general. Between the three of us ordered everything and the kitchen sink so we were good. We started with truffle fries, nachos, wings, and I had \""The Royale Burger\"".\n\nThe truffle fries was Amazing! By far the best truffle fries had in long time. I had the ones at more fancy place like Olives that totally suck compare too Umami. The thing that makes them shine above the rest. The homemade truffle cheese that put over the fries, then add truffle oil on top, and nice hot right out of the fryer. Just the smell is divine. If not fungus person this not the dish for you. But if love cheese fries in general these truffle fries take tradition fries too another level. Rich. The Nachos with the short rib meat on top, fresh guacamole (one of the better ones had in town), jalape\u00f1o, fresh cilantro sprigs, and the chips. The CHIPS tell fresh chips nice thick corn ones. I could have just eaten chips and salsa whole game be content in life. Me my pet peeves with Nachos like mound of stuff on top but think excess not always better. I love the fact that really had the right amount that none of the chips got completely drowned by the topping that the chips on the bottom bottom still has the crispy crunch. The chicken wings we had six an six. Those were ok nothing really memorable about them. \n\nThe \""Royale\"" Burger talk about gourmet burger! This one rivals any of the top gourmet burger joints in Vegas. I can honestly say hit the full list from Gordan, Bobby, Burger Bar, Holstein, Fuku, Bachi, and the only one missing is Guy. The thing I love is the combination of all the flavors. It heavy burger with lots of meat! The burger, short ribs on top, then got truffle cheese, and believe might put hint of truffle oil top it off. Messy burger. Those are the best one that all the good stuff comes out with every bite and gets all over your hands. The \""U\"" on top of all the burger that nice touch that definitely  Umami style. The burger buns are on point. Few more reading description that need get me some next visit. \n\nThe service was five star for me!!!! Our server was on it. This was on FOOTBALL day or say MNF. Our server was friendly and during the game on it making sure never empty on our beers. Since first timers all around answered all our questions. \n\nIf one thing that had issue. Maybe only had one hostess working that night. Not sure if we sit ourselves down or go hostess stand get seated no sign. From the outside looks more like lounge then restaurant restaurant. I never checked out the Beer Garden. \n\nUmami Burger is awesome. I look forward too trying more of the burgers next time."
1820	0	a	"First off, if you're going to call yourself a beer garden, please have more than ten common, mediocre beers on draft. Selection of bottled/canned was okay, and they had a handful of unusual ones but not enough to justify the name. Personally I don't consider Stella Cidre a \""specialty beer\"" but whatever.\n\nFood was decent- be aware that the burgers themselves are small. Though other reviews complain of the meat being overcooked and dry, mine was cooked to perfect medium rare- opted for the truffle burger and was pleasantly surprised by it.  Hatch burger was decent, Mintilamism dessert was too- not worth writing home about. The service was, though... in a bad way.\n\nFirst words from our server were \""Hi, I'll be with you guys in a few minutes.\"" Um, okay. She was alright, aside from weird timing issues where our first round of drinks didn't come out until our burger. She was a lot friendlier an hour in when her shift was up and she was encouraging us to close our tab- not a problem. However, the server she handed us off to, Sarah(?)-- never ONCE checked on us in the additional 90 minutes we stayed watching the second half of the Spurs game. No one did. For ninety minutes. There's that crappy SLS service I'd heard about.\n\nAlso, please note that though the booths come with private screens, in order to change the channel your server will have to ask the sports book staff- weird and inconvenient set up."
1821	0	a	This is by far the worst experience I've ever had at a restaurant. We waited one hour prior to getting waters. The manager even came over to the table and all he offered was the measly water that we had been waiting for for more than an hour. The food was subpar the service was ridiculously slow. As being a Vegas local, I thought this was a poor indicator of how service is in this town. Although, I probably will come back again because I live so close I hope the service will be better. We also had to get our own drinks from the bar because they were taking so long to get to our table.
1822	0	a	The burgers itself are delicious.. The truffle fries are nothing short of GODLY.\n\nUnfortunately the service was quite the opposite..\n\nthe first time we showed up we had placed an order at 11:00PM for a few of their signature jose andrees burgers.\n\nwe were standing around waiting, they said they could text us when it was ready so I left my # and we hit the tables. \n\na few heaters later, no text.\n\nsome more heaters, still no text.\n\nno text, no calls, no texts. you get the point..\n\nwe went back and had inquired about our burgers through an employee who said she would go and check, she left.\n\ninquired again through another employee, he left.. never came back.\n\nwe saw them bring out several to-go orders and leave them on the bar counter and we had asked if either of them were ours.. the waitress said not yet and she, just like the others said she would go and check.\n\nat around 12:15AM my friend said forget it, he hopped the line and started checking bags. WHAT DO YOU KNOW? our order was sitting on the counter and the completed ticket said 11:30PM.\n\nOur burgers were sitting on the counter for 45 minutes, cold as a pair of rock solid fake silicon implants.\n\n***we asked the girl at the bar, she said sorry, I can get you guys a free round what would you like? **I asked for a Hennessy on the rocks and she said SORRY, ONLY WELL-DRINKS. OR A BEER. I dont want to sound like a snob but keep in mind we paid $40 for two burgers and some FRIES?!?\n\nthe manager said sorry, ill see if they can make you a new set. after eating they were just nuked a bit because the bread was softer than a pair of real.. well, nevermind.\n\nhe apologized and said if we came back he would take care of us.\n\nwe ordered $220 worth of burgers to the rooms and the truffle fries were delicious. we also came back and dined in to watch the sunday games while gambling away our life savings and the waiter wearing the packers jersey on 12/14 was phenomenal.\n\neither way we didnt get the manager, didnt want to be disappointed.
1823	1	a	Love this place! I've been to Umami Burger in NYC and it's excellent; honestly, no different at this location. The service is great. Our waiter was very friendly and attentive. I had the Greenbird Burger - delicious! The fries were a bit over salted but still really good. Drinks are good; I had the Black Raz Mojito which wasn't overly strong but still pretty good. Prices are high.. that's the only drawback to this place (seems more like NYC than Las Vegas). But if you're just visiting Vegas and need some good food and beer (they have quite a selection), then it's worth it!
1824	0	a	I like Umami Burger but not this location.\n\nThe quality standard at this location was poor and what the heck, why it has to be inside a sports book? We decided to take a seat outside but even there TVs hanged on the walls and people were watching them without paying attention to the food.
1825	1	a	I heard a lot of buzz around Umami this last year. Friends, yelp, and a whole slue of other people have told me how much their love their burgers. While I enjoy a good gormet burger, normally I find myself always going back to The Counter and calling it good because I have yet to find something to top that experience. \n\nWhile Umami is indeed really good, I still do not think it takes the title of being top dog. \n\nWe were eating at the SLS and everyone wanted to try a new burger. We sat down in the heavy sports bar feel of umami because there are TV's absolutely everywhere just like a sports book. It took us a forever and a half to get served because of a mix up, but when we actually ordered everything was smooth sailing. \n\nI shared a truffle burger and some sweet potato fries. I loved the truffle on the burger, the cheese, the patty being cooked just right, and the bun. It was just a little bit small for what I was paying I feel. I got the sweet potato fries because my girlfriend really wanted them. Normally I hate sweet potato fries, but these were not like other's I have had before because they had cinnamon sugar sprinkled on them. This must have been magic pixie dust because it made them go from something I do not enjoy to a plate of fried potatoes that I wish I was no longer splitting with someone else.
1826	1	a	"Amazing service. Really. I've never heard of this burger chain, but hadn't eaten in 12 hours and 12 states. I just wanted a burger. The menu was a befuddlement of strange ways to make a burger. I picked a Cali burger but without the house sauce (careful due to egg allergy). It tasted weird, really...weird. The tomato was a glop (fire roasted apparently) and the onions were more like egg noodles - wet cooked strings. \nI scraped it off and tried again but it still tasted weird. Megan, my attentive waitress, asked if everything was good. I expressed my opinion. Although I didn't like it I didn't blame the restaurant. Sometimes things just aren't to your taste. However my  surprise and delight the manager immediately swooped in, organized for me as close to a \""regular\"" burger as they were able to construct - which was basically burger, bun, lettuce, raw onions. The manager also brought over a selection of sauces on the side. She asked if I like mustard. I said don't even go there I only like colemans. 3 minutes later she showed up with a side dish of English mustard! The new burger was much more to my liking.\n\nSo there you go - it's not my kind of restaurant - but that's no-ones fault. This place went above and beyond to make it as right as they possibly could. Epically amazing service."
1827	1	a	My coworkers and I had an amazing lunch today...\n\nWe tried the Truffle Burger, Truffle Especial, BBQ Burger, the sweet potato fries, the truffle fries and the onion rings! The food was absolutely delicious, the decor is great and the service was pretty good. I would have gave them 4-stars since the service was semi-lack luster, but the food was easily 6-stars, so it averaged out! Lol \n\nOur fat asses also got two ice cream sandwiches and they were both great! (Snicker doodle and mint)\n\nThis place is a must try...
1828	0	a	"It's pretty crazy how an experience can vary from one day to another.\n\nWe came in to just grab some dessert. We got a couple of ice cream cookies and shared it among friends. Amazing! The salted caramel is probably my favorite. More importantly the gentleman that served us was AWESOME. Even though we were JUST getting dessert, he treated us super nice, was super personable and even checked in on us to see how the desserts were.\n\nSo, we came back the next night. This time to eat....sure cookies were the plan, but also to grab a late meal. This time, shiz went south. Real fast.\n\nPlaced our orders...and even though it was pricey I ordered a frozen beer. I think they are only available in a few places so I said what the heck. Got SUPER excited...then....our waitress forgot my beer. Like never wrote it down, never came with it. Burgers came out. They were good....\n\nI mentioned to the waitress my beer (after flagging her down ... since she disappeared for a while). And told her we'd like to take a look at the dessert menu.\n\n5 minutes pass.\n10 minutes pass.\n\nShe finally comes back! Alright, so do you guys want dessert? UMMMM...you forgot to bring dessert menu??? Oh, yea...here let me get you one. No, that's fine. We will skip dessert. At this point I was frustrated. She didn't bring my beer. She wasn't around the entire time. She forgot the dessert menu. \n\nI asked for the manager and she came over. She gave me what I considered to be a pre-rehearsed speech. \""We are going to take care of your meal.\"" No, thank you...I'd like to pay. I just wanted you to know that your waitress really ruined the experience...and the guy the night before is AWESOME. \""I understand sir, that you didn't ask to speak to me to get a comped meal, but we will be taking care of it since you were not 100% satisfied.\"" It was robotic they way she said it. I reduced again. We went back and fourth a few times...then she finally brought my bill.\n\nListen, I'm sure they deal with drunk, angry customers all the time. But I was obviously sober (she forgot my beer, remember?). I genuinely wanted the manager to know, hey...this person is f'n up while also give props to the other dude. She seemed uninterested, and just offered a comp meal as a solution. I didn't want a comp meal.\n\nSo while the food is good - the service can really ruin the experience."
1829	0	a	I came here to have lunch with my boyfriend. We ordered cheese pizza with sausage and a Caesar salad. I'm not really a fan of Margherita pizza  and the mozzarella didn't cover all of the sauce, so I asked for some more graded cheese. I don't know if the graded cheese was the cause, but our entire pizza fell apart. The crust was edible and delicious, and this place has potential to be the new custom built, considering it's closing, but ALL of the cheese fell off, and the crust under the cheese seemed half cooked. It was very greasy and soggy other than the crust :(
1830	1	a	Great pizza fast and efficient service we will be back!!!\n\nWe got the margarita pizza and pizza zucca\n\nLoved it all
1831	0	a	Well...\n\nIt took about 25 minutes to get my pizza because, even though I paid for it, no one ever made it. The manager apologized and offered free dessert. \n\nThe pizza itself...is close but not great. The product was very wet and all the ingredients slipped off the dough. \n\nFor the price, once they get out the kinks and make the product, this place will be decent. However, they're nowhere near there.
1832	1	a	Came here to try some real Neapolitan pizza and I wasn't disappointed! The pizza is made right in front of you and the staff even helps recommend items.  Very friendly staff and knowledgeable. Will be back for more!
1833	0	a	I had high hopes for this place. The staff was so friendly but unfortunately the food was terrible. everything about it was horrible: flavor, texture, presentation, etc. The salad was good enough that we ate it after we threw out the pizza.
1834	0	a	Rip off 8 dollars a beer!  Seriously not kidding!  Insane!  Truly beyond belief!  Pizzas also very overpriced!
1835	0	a	Pizza was not cooked enough, crust was completely soggy and mushy in the middle. Took forever to make my friends salad. At least it was a cute atmosphere and they had a decent beer selection.
1836	1	a	"Staying at SLS we had only a couple of restaurant, and having this place open so late is the best thing!! I had their pizza twice during my 3 day stay. First time I had the margarita pizza with pepperoni and mushroom. The second time I had the verde (pesto) with gorgonzola cheese and chicken. They were both amazing but I kinda liked the pesto one a little more. \n\nThe concept is very unique. You go down the line and chose your \""base\"" which is the sauce. Then you can choose from their specialty menus which has toppings pre-selected of you can just pick your own. The open up a ball of dough right in front of you, and they dont use pre-shredded mozzarella. They use fresh mozzarella balls and tear it up and put it on the pizza right then and there. It takes some time to bake of course but its really good pizza and hits the spot!!! You can easlly get a pizza for less than 10 bucks. Its a personal pizza and i polished mine off in one sitting but for the light eater, 2 people can easily share 1 pizza.\n\nVery good!"
1837	0	a	I'm a local, and live not far from SLS. The pizza and salad I enjoyed was really very good in quality. The experience was just taken down several notches by the disorganized staff and simply lengthy process getting the food. \n\nIt's not all that obvious what you should do when you walk in. There's a couple of people making pizzas that logically looks like you might need to order there. The first register is apparently where you're supposed to order but you'd never know that until you're told. There was no staff member at the second register for a good 5 minutes and the beer I wanted was out.
1838	0	a	Worst pizza ever.... Soggy and people working there have no personality.  Excited to have pizza but not when the toppings dall off and its soggy
1839	0	a	I've never had a pizza that falls apart from the center as you pick up a slice. The quality of the veggies and outer crust was good, but the heart and soul of the pizza (the center with the yummy toppings) was a disaster that couldn't be eaten unless you like to spoon your pizza off the box. Gross!!\n\nThey get 2 stars for making the pizza look/smell good, having good service and a decent salad.\n\nNo I won't be giving them a second try.
1840	0	a	The Skinny: fall apart pies with soggy middles and really odd tasting Caesar salad(2) service: counter service...make sure they give you a ticket after you order your pizza and salad. They missed our salad so we had to wait to get it. (2), value: although the ingredients are good, the crust just doesn't hold up. Throw in a horrible Caesar, I'd pass on this place. (2)\n\nFYI- they serve Pepsi products here in a sleek, small digital soda machine.\n\nThis joint tries to make thin crust Settobello-type pizza in a counter service environment. You line up at the pizza making line, design your masterpiece or choose a specialty pie, order your salad/appetizers. After that, they print you a ticket which you give to the register. At the register, you order your drinks and wait for your order to be fired. They call your number when the pizza is ready. \n\nThey have water cups, small plates, utensils, napkins and small boxes for leftovers on a side counter where you help yourself.\n\nThis is the type of pizza that doesn't hold up well so be aware and eat it at the restaurant and do not get it to go.\n\nThe hubs wanted to create his own pizza and I warned him not to go overboard with ingredients. Like 2 toppings is probably the maximum you want to get. He insisted on the marinara (all sauce with garlic and oregano) with ricotta, sausage and mushroom. As the pizza maker loaded the pizza with 2 large scoops of sauce, this was a disaster in the making. The pizza was horribly soggy in the middle while the garlic was not evenly distributed in the pizza so you ended up with mouthful of garlic. The sausage and mushrooms were bland too. Textural violation number 1 of the night.\n\nOkay, shame on us for making a bad pizza. \n\nBut for the Tartufo, I expected them to make a quality product as it is their specialty pie. Again, terribly soggy pizza, greasy as hell from the excess amount of olive oil - literally dripping down my hand as I am trying to eat it. There are too much toppings for such a thin crust and it totally does not hold up. Ugh! Textural violation number 2 of the night. Flavorwise, this one was okay but nothing special. The truffle was a bit understated while eating the pizza.\n\nThere are 2 problems because the pizzas were fired correctly (anymore, the crust would be burnt). Either the crust is the issue or it is too much toppings. My vote goes to the amount of toppings because the edge of the crust was fine.\n\nThe Caesar was horrible. Probably the worst Caesar I've had in a long time. There was a very weird fruity aroma that permeated throughout the salad. I think maybe it is the type of cheese they used. Or maybe some other elements from another salad got mixed in. Whatever it was, it was very off putting. I didn't taste any garlic or anchovies in the dressing at all. The red leaf lettuce they threw in became limp quickly from the acidity of the dressing and having too much dressing. Textural violation number 3 -it's a hat trick!\n\nEnd of the story, I am glad we got to try it as a half priced local deal. Full price I would have been mad. Skip this joint. You can get better quality pizza and salad elsewhere for a better value. (2 starred review)
1841	0	a	OK, so here's a place that tries to make Neapolitan Pizza with the convenience of a drive thru or better said walk through, picking your own toppings, which given the fact that the pizza takes about 90 minutes to bake sounds like a great idea.\nBeyond that things start to fall apart, I want to specify that this review is for those that know and love the taste of authentic Neapolitan Pizza, if you're the type of person that orders take out from Domino's then don't bother reading this review.\n\nGoing back to the place above the first thing that put me off is how the ingredients are preserved reminding me of Subway, staff is pretty bored looking nothing that would hint that your pizzaiolo is a master at what he does, for those of you who know, there's a lot going on before that dough hits the oven.\n\nHowever I like to point out that the dough came actually cooked almost to perfection however the middle was soggy and watery which is a big no no and the taste of the ingredients a far cry from what you'd expect in a Neapolitan pizza place.\n\nSo far I am yet to find a place to match the first and best Neapolitan Pizza in town, those of you who are fans know who I'm talking about, I don't want others to think I am doing any sort of advertising here, there a couple of other spots that come close but the place above it's not it.
1842	0	a	I came here with high expectations. I found the staff very friendly and helpful. I was quickly greeted by a nice girl with pigtail braids who took my food order. I ordered both the Margarita pizza and the Sausage & Pepper pizza. I found the pizzas reasonably priced for Vegas, although the soda being almost $5 seemed a little high. \n\nThe Very low quality of pizza is what gives this place only ONE-Star. I found the pizza to be soggy in the middle. The sauce was not to my liking either. It reminded me of the stuff in the spaghetti-o can.  Overall, I found the pizza absolutely nasty. I tossed out most of it. I wont be checking this place out again.
1843	0	a	Expensive and not worth it. Crust is super soggy, and flavoring is bland. If you have to eat and have no other options sure, but I won't be coming back if I can help it.
1844	0	a	This is the worst place ever on the face of the earth. Horrible food and worst customer service. Joe was one pathetic guy who was unwilling to do anything about burned and tasteless watery pizza. Don't waste your money here. You will regret it.
1845	0	a	Very disappointing experience.  This cafeteria style pizzeria has you walk through a line.  No one seemed to know what they were doing and several times the person on the other side of the counter referred me to someone down the way.  You order your pizza at the first stop, sides etc at the next and then you get rung up.  They don't have a large selection of toppings and they don't seem to use premium ingredients.  Further, the antipasta salad was mostly lettuce and you couldn't even taste any flavor to the little bit of meat which was there.  The pizza had a burnt taste to it, more so than expected.
1846	0	a	"Started out really great. I asked for a very well done pizza I made sure to tell more than one person so my order was correct.  Once I finally got my pizza it game out very underdone and extremely soggy. I could see this from just taking one look at my pizza. When I asked if they could cook my pizza more I was told \""we don't do well done pizzas\"". Also they were very rude when I asked to talk to the manager about the situation. All together this was a terrible experience for me and I will NOT return... very disappointed."
1847	0	a	This was my fourth visit to this place. And will for sure be my last. I came in tonight for the resorts social Sundays promotion where locals get 50% off the bill. My pizza was passed off to another customer on the assembly line. Ordered 2 salads and the ticket got lost. Ordered a side of broccolini and it was stone cold and WAY too spicy. I like heat but it wasn't edible. The best part of the meal was the complimentary ice water and when I walked out. This is the only venue on the property that doesn't seem to be able to get their act together. The entire team seems lost and definitely not a sign of management to be seen. A huge turn off and will most definitely be letting friends and family know about the poor service here.
1848	0	a	Based on the reviews and the article in the magazine I expected to have great tasting pizza. I loved that it was thin crust but when I got it, it was soggy and not crispy at all. The pizza was cut and I use that word loosely because we had to get a knife and recut it in order to pull the slices apart. Toppings was good and not skimpy. The pizza was ok not the best. I probably won't be back.
1849	1	a	"The new great 24/7 breakfast place on the Strip! [/obligatoryhype]\n\nNow that that's out of the way, this is a place that you should definitely check out if you're remotely tolerant of starchy breakfast items. It's one of the slew of restaurants in the brand-new, relatively navigable SLS. Just FYI, self-parking (accessible on Paradise Rd. just south of Sahara) was fine although it could certainly get worse.\n\nUnfortunately, the meal did not start off on a positive note. A server did not come to greet me until 10 minutes after I joined my friends at their table, and it took at least 15 minutes for me just to get some water and a coffee mug. Heck, even that somehow devolved into a three-trip process (coffee press and glass of ice, then water pitcher, then coffee cup). My tablemates were apparently there for even longer without being able to order. It's even sadder when you consider the pack of employees seemingly always huddled around the cashier station (check out Norm's photo when he posts it). Thankfully, Michael complained and got the manager to switch servers, and service was fine afterward.\n\nI'm not a coffee person, but I'm sure enthusiasts will enjoy the French press coffee with complimentary refills, and tired people (yours truly) will enjoy the caffeine. I did also have a taste of a \""boozy shake\"" that I'm reasonably sure was the Saturday Morning Fever (how appropriate), with vanilla bean ice cream, griddled buttermilk cake, Bailey's, Kahlua, and sweet cream. It was sweet and creamy with just a hint of alcohol, although I'm not sure I'd pony up $15 for it for anything other than a special occasion.\n\nFood-wise, I was able to sample four items with benevolent benefactor Michael U. and the wonderful Norm K. this morning. First round included the \""Peanut Bubba\"" French toast. It's based on a traditional French toast but is coated in an excellent peanut butter crunch that gives it an otherworldly flavor. With the powered sugar and vanilla whipped cream on top, I didn't even need maple syrup for this one. By far my favorite of the meal.\n\nNext up was the \""Mouthful of Yum\"" brown-sugar banana pancakes with crushed Butterfinger and Godiva Chocolate Liqueur (and a whipped cream made of said liqueur). Loved the moistness, the crunch, and the moderately sweet flavor. I can see this being a repeat order as well.\n\nSecond round included the \""Devil's Daydream\"" French toast, which is basically dark and bittersweet chocolate plus bourbon. It didn't quite mesh with my palate even after the addition of maple syrup, so I didn't go back for seconds. I can see how it would appeal to some though. We also had the \""Sow Your Oats\"" pancakes with honey, cinnamon, and rolled oats. It was a little dry, so I found myself going back to the other pancakes, but it's still flavorful and can pass muster with maple syrup added.\n\nWe all left quite satiated. Actually, we probably would have finished the whole breakfast if they hadn't upsized the second pancake order to three oversized monstrosities (instead of just two oversized monstrosities). I wouldn't recommend ordering more than one item per person unless you're willing to take leftovers to-go (in a pizza box, no less, due to insane pancake proportions).\n\nThe food that we had is definitely great. While I didn't personally enjoy all of the items as much as I would have wanted, I recognize that there's quality in the recipes and in the kitchen's execution. I know that their menu has more savory breakfast and non-breakfast items (eggs, burgers, sandwiches, etc.), but considering that I got to try a few of what seem to be their specialties, I'm giving a generous four stars under the very important assumption that the service improves in the future and that the food remains the same or also improves."
1850	0	a	"Opening Day - Saturday, August 23, 2014.  We arrived at The Griddle 15 minutes before our 9pm reservation.  I noticed it was very empty (see photo attached that I took from my table once I was seated).  We had to wait about 15 minutes for our table but I was 15 minutes early so that didn't bother me.  I was however bothered by a few things:\n---  I noticed that as people walked up to be seated without a reservation, they were being told it was a 45 minute wait list.  I found that odd considering the place was less than half full (again, see attached photo).  I can only guess they were short staffed on opening weekend and there is no excuse for that.  Better to have extra staff on hand than to be short and give people a bad impression.   \n--- When the hostess came to seat us, she walked us into a very empty room of booths and tables and took us to a small table rubbing elbows with the only other people seated in that section (the guys in the center of my attached photo, they tried to seat us at the table right next to them).    I always prefer a booth but I wasn't asked for a preference.  I think it's common sense with a wide open selection of tables to at least offer your guests a table that isn't on top of the neighbors.  At that point I requested a booth and pointed out that the restaurant has plenty of open seating.  The hostess seemed annoyed with my request but seated us at a booth on the back wall.  \n---  I have to note that in the 15 minutes I waited to be seated at least 10 people approached the desk to be seated and were told it would be 45 minutes.  Many of them walked off.  With all those empty tables, there were not very many people seated during the time I was in the restaurant.  They could have made a lot more money if they had filled those tables.  \n\nThe food however was delicious.  I had pancakes for dinner, the regular pancakes, none of the specialties.  Enough for 4 people but delicious.  My boyfriend had \""The Last Amigo\"" tacos and said they were delicious.  He had some of my pancakes for dessert but I still left behind more than we ate.  I would go back, for the food and in hopes they have corrected their issues."
1851	1	a	Went for a late night meal. Decided to check out the new SLS hotel and tried Griddle Cafe. The Pancake Boozy Shake was incredible - I had the Golden Ticket. I also had the Eggs Benidict. Instead of using English muffins they used potato skins. Yummy! I will be back to try the pancakes next time and get another boozy shake.
1852	0	a	Worst experience!  Wanted it to be good because the LA is good.  No such luck!!Would rather go to IHOP than every go back!  The service was rude and very inexperienced.  The food was brought out cold and tasteless.\nAttention: Save your money, taste buds and sanity!  The LV Griddle is a waste of space!\nPlease note: this place does not deserve the one star I was forced to give them!!!
1853	1	a	Excellent place for breakfast. Great vibe. Staff was friendly. Food was delicious. Tea setup was one of the better ones in the city. Soundtrack was engaging. Definitely the new Mr. Luckys. I can see this place packed late night with every night walker trying to nurse away the oncoming hangover with the hair of the dog and an extremely large omelette with tons of meat in it.
1854	0	a	To start with there is a 35 minute wait to get in. Next we order after waiting 15 minutes for the waiter. 45 minutes to get the food all of which should only take 10-15 minutes. The restaurant had extremely loud music the entire time causing you to have to yell to talk to the wait staff. The AC was turned down so low we were freezing the entire time and had to put our drinks on the napkins to keep them from blowing away from the AC. Food was extremely overpriced for what you get. food was dry and tasteless the only flavor was from the condiments on the table. Would not recommend going there. We will never be back
1855	1	a	Checked out this new breakfast 24 hour restaurant at SLS, and sat at the bar.  The bartender, Louie, gave excellent customer service!  I got the Old Fashioned pancakes, and it was the 2nd best pancakes I've ever had!  The portion size for the price you pay is amazing!  You could feed a family with my pancakes.. Thanks Louie!  We will definitely return! :D\n\nps my fiancee got the pesto shrimp sandwich, which was amazing too!
1856	1	a	This place is OVER THE TOP.\n\nI give it 5 stars because you can feed a family of four (hundred) on one meal.\n\nDO NOT ORDER AN ENTREE FOR YOURSELF.\nRinse Repeat.\nDO NOT ORDER AN ENTREE FOR YOURSELF.\n\nWe went there twice and had to take home food ... and we fed more than Jesus did with the leftovers... I think we fed 5027 people.  Sorry Jesus.\n\nNot so impressed with the sandwiches... we had the shrimp pesto... just too much sauce on that thing... but HUGE... and HUGE pile of fries for $ 14... MEAL FOR TWO.\n\nBreakfast was KILLER.  Meaning I will die young because I ate 17,307 calories in 45 minutes....\n\nHad the 3 eggs and Ham.  Ham for the entire nation of Belgium.\n\nMy buddy had the banana pancakes... the size of manhole covers !  He took one home with him to use as a throw rug.... a very tasty throw rug.\n\nNot kidding... I've had pancakes for 4 days since we took those island size cakes home with us.\n\nIf you don't eat there... just do there to look at the Monster Food...it will make you feel very tiny....
1857	1	a	Two words: French Toast. It's a must order! The other reviewers that talk about the portion sizes are right - don't order your own entree. Between three people, we finished the French Toast but MAYBE ate 1/3 of the pancakes. The guy next to us was laughing at our plates (he ordered a sandwich). Little did he know, those are HUGE, too. Hahaha. No reservations, so the wait can be a little long (but worth it). It's a little loud in there, too, but hopefully the restaurant will eventually install some acoustic insulation.
1858	1	a	"Items Selected:\nMedium Roast Coffee\n\""Good Ol' Fashioned\"" Our original buttermilk recipe, griddle-cooked to perfection!\nThe Golden Ticket panCAKE Shake - Vanilla Bean Ice Cream, Griddled Buttermilk Cake, Giffard Banana Liqueur, Kissed Caramel Vodka, Cinnamon Sugar Vodka, and Whipped Cream Vodka\n\""Tis The Season\"" ~ Our \""Good Ol' Fashioned\"" recipe mixed with our own pumpkin pie filling.

Eating in a group of locals and visitors, the later a big group of guys in town for The Olympia, it was largely with intentions of touring the menu that our order was crafted and although a few plates of proteins such as eggs and bacon were ordered the 'main event' was five stacks of pancakes and three piles of French Toast served in two rounds - a creamy panCAKE shake lightly tinged with boozy bananas plus plenty of coffee to wash it all down.  Obviously an absurd order, better suited to a table nearly twice our size, it was in the fluffy Good Ol' Fashioned, Peanut Bubba, Chocolate Chip Cookie, and Barry Mellow that we began and with Vermont Maple Syrup gilding many bites both the toasts went quickly, the standard buttermilk flapjacks nearly finished as well.  Moving onward with table cleared and more coffee poured as newly announced GM Adam Scholten watched his team work, round two began with the rich Nutella laden bread again a fan favorite, though the piping hot five-pound plate of flavors spot-on for pumpkin pie was quite delicious as well.  Finding the Barry Yellow a touch too lemony and not particularly well paired to syrup while Room Service and Saturday Morning Fever both fell victim to \""good, but not as good as the rest\"" verdicts at a table approaching food-coma it should be obvious to anyone that leftovers were abundant and all packed individually with big bags to be carried the bill was paid, a smile on every face as we waddled back to vehicles with no plans to eat until late that evening.\n\nHaving now found its footing with a service staff that seemed perpetually in motion I'm happy to say that The SLS Griddle Caf\u00e9 is now finally showing promise to be as good as its big brother in LA - the lack of \""off menu\"" specials such as the Sweet Fantasy Baby Carrot Cake Pancakes and slow replacement of leaky French presses being resolved by steel replacements the only thing holding them back."
1859	1	a	This place has great food but the service is alright. I got the tequila jo's shrimp tacos and coffee and both were very good. The waitress was kind but our food and drinks took a very long time to come out and the food servers were very rude and impatient. In general, I think not only this restaurant but the entire SLS hotel is understaffed considering their recent opening and thus the service here wasn't any worse or better than the overall service we received from the hotel and casino.
1860	0	a	(Serving) size doesn't always mean better.  Was disappointed with the pancake. I was so looking forward to this too after seeing the great reviews. The service didn't make up for the experience either. Love the hotel, but won't be rushing back to this cafe anytime soon.
1861	1	a	"I had been to the LA location before and enjoyed my food, and I was staying at SLS so it was a no brainer to come here for breakfast during my stay.  \n\nI got the cheesecakey Creme de la Creme French Toast at the LA location and really liked it.  I had leftovers so I finished it later for dinner after the drive back home to the Bay and it was still yummy.  Btw I'm weird about reheated food :p  This time I got the \""Yellow Brick Road\"" pancake.  Yes, just a single pancake (by request), not a stack of pancakes, and it was still too much food!  It was good though :)  I'm a butterscotch and caramel lover so this was perfect for me!  It's basically butterscotch, caramel, walnuts, vanilla whipped cream, and powdered sugar.  My sister got the Wholey Moley which I didn't taste this time but did when we went to the one in LA - I remember liking it for sure.  We also got an egg dish to share, which came with eggs your way, hash browns, and toast (which we were too full to even eat).\n\nThis is definitely a popular place.  We got to the restaurant a little after 7am on a Tuesday and it was almost completely full by 8am.  Come here hungry or split with a friend - the servings here are huge!!  Luckily I had been to the one in LA so I knew what I was in for.  There is a pancake here for everyone!"
1862	1	a	"The service is great, the food is delicious!!!!\nThe portions are huge!!! \""Hash it out\"" is a little spicy but amazing it's enough for 2 people. You eat breakfast there and you are full all day!"
1863	1	a	The food is AMAZING. Blueberry flapjacks are a must! The portion size was comically large. They also make a decent Bloody Mary. \n\nOnly downsides:\n\nThe wait. But yes it is worth it. Just be prepared for a line. \n\nThe hours say it's 24/7 but every time I've been by it in the afternoon it's all closed up.
1864	1	a	this place is so cute for breakfast. look up at the signs. \n\nthe first day i stayed at the SLS i saw the line wrapped around the casino for this place. i knew i would have to make some time to eat there.\n\ni stopped by on my way out. my flight was at 7 am so i stopped by at 5 am to get a quick breakfast. i had the french press and an oat pancake. it was GIGANTIC, bigger than the plate it was on. i was instructed to eat it from the middle. it was so big i couldn't finish it so it ended up being a giant pancake with a hole in the middle. it was delicious and quite an experience. the portions are big so prepare yourself!\n\n* they used to be open 24 hours but close during dinner (sounds weird but it makes sense).
1865	1	a	The breakfast here is very good! Doesn't seem to be a bad dish on the menu. The coffee is the best I've had, comes in a French Press. Pricey though, $4.75 a person. But it's very good. They're known for their pancakes and french toast, and they both are phenomenal, many different pancake choices.
1866	1	a	We stayed four days at the SLS Hotel n Casino. On our last night we ate here. The food is excellent n they give u large portions. The waiter brought me a second plate so I could cut my pancakes in fourths and eat more smaller portions of it. The staff was friendly and the atmosphere was relaxing. If you get a chance put this on your list of places to eat.
1867	1	a	"Short Review:\nCome hungry because the Griddle Cafe hooks it up.  Are you looking for huge stacks at a great price?  Then the Griddle Cafe is the place for you.  Their stacks are huge, fluffy, and tasty.  Not a pancake fan?  No worries....The Griddle Caf\u00e9 has an extensive breakfast menu and you can also build your own burger.  Trust me...The Griddle Cafe is worth it. \n\nLong Review:  \nI've been the to the LA location and was impressed with their pancakes, their French toast, and their service. What I disliked about the LA location is the wait.  Yup, I'm one of those fools that waited over an hour for breakfast at their LA location. I didn't regret my meal, but wasn't heading back anytime soon due to the wait.  Now, they're here in Las Vegas inside the SLS and the wait isn't as bad.  You know what that means?  That means, a monster breakfast for Mel C and his fork.  \n\nSo, what's good?  Well, here are my thoughts. \n\n-Peanut Bubba French Toast: If you're a peanut butter lover, then you'll love this.  French toast that's dipped in peanut butter?  Enough said.  Texture is crunchy on the outside and peanut buttery on the inside.  I love that peanut butter after taste.  NOTE:  I had this at their LA location.  This is on the LV menu as well. \n\n-Sow Your Oats:  Cinnamon, Honey, and Rolled Oats??? Imagine your typical bowl of oatmeal with cinnamon.  Well, that's what you get with their \""Sow Your Oats\"" stack. Texture is different, but is one of their popular stacks. NOTE:  I had this at their LA location.  This is on the LV menu as well.\n\n-The Golden Ticket:  This is for you banana lovers out there.  I don't eat much fruit due to allergies, but willing to take the risk after sampling this bad boy.  Banana, caramel and walnuts are all combined to create this masterpiece.  \n\n-Pure Imagination:  This is basically their \""Build-Your-Own\"" burger or sandwich.  Yes, I got this.  I love pancakes, but was craving a sandwich or burger on my last visit here.  I had them create a chicken sandwich with mushrooms, jack cheese, and green chili.  This was sloppy, but good.  The huge plus with the side of steak fries.  \n\n-Chicken Breast and Egg Whites:  Yup...I got boring on one of my visits.  Actually, I supplemented the chicken breast and egg whites to one of my meals.  Taste wise...it's just grilled chicken breast and eggs whites.  Nothing special. NOTE:  I had this at their LA location.  This is on the LV menu as well. \n\n-Tortilla Chips:  Why do I even mention this?  Because it was good and addicting. Fresh, crispy, and airy is how I would describe them.  \n\nOverall, there isn't one thing that I've had here that was disappointing.  Also, don't let the price of their meals fool you.  Their low price on most meals is backed up by monster servings.  One whole order of their pancakes easily serves 4 people or two Mel C's.  \n\nI would probably give the LA location 4 stars, a one star drop due to the wait.  But at this location, the wait wasn't bad and they're local for me.  So, 5 stars it is.  Yeah Buddy!\n\n\nTIP:  If you don't have a huge appetite, then order just one stack.  A whole order of their stacks equals food coma."
1868	0	a	So Loud.  You cannot hear a thing due to the bad design. Food was good but ridiculously huge. Wasteful.  Manager was a dick.
1869	0	a	Horrible experience, expensive and not worth the wait. \nI have had better breakfast at Denny's \nGo to hash house instead
1870	0	a	We were so excited for this restaurant! Unfortunately, it was very bland. The food starts with interesting concepts but then falls short of tasting interesting. It *all* lacked the ingredient that gives it the kick. Creme De la Creme really needed since short of berry to make it interesting. Gone Shrimpin' was much improved with pico de gallo. Black Magic was ridiculously huge, but it also was missing that kick-- probably strawberries would have fixed it. The tea was good and huge, as was the coffee. The service was stellar.
1871	1	a	Just wow!!! I'll be a drove a little for my amazing food...  Service was amazing. I seat at the bar. Most come back to try more
1872	1	a	Great Spot! The chocolate chip Cookie French toast is amazing. HUGE portions as well. Dare anyone to try and finish those two slices of heaven in one sitting.
1873	0	a	Wish I could try it.\nHere for work and I've been here for 4 mornings now.\nEverytime I try to get in, there's a wait of an hour or more.\nI need to get to work and can't wait for that kind of time.\nOh well...
1874	1	a	This place has great french press coffee and O-Worthy french toast. The decor leaves a little to be desired, but the buttery, sugary goodness makes up for it. Come early or be prepared to wait in line. It's worth it!
1875	1	a	The Griddle Cafe is one of my favorite Cali spots.  I go almost every trip.  I was so excited that they were coming to Vegas.  We waited a few weeks for the crowds to die down.  Well they died down alright.  The first time we went...they were closed.  We asked security nearby and they said they shortened their hours to 11-4 during the week and 24 hrs only on the weekend.  He said they were slow at night.  I was expecting a line.  That didn't seem like a good sign.  Less then a month and already cutting back on hours.  Is the SLS that dead?  Damn.  Turns out it is 11pm-4pm.  So not near as bad as 11am-4pm we took it as.  I thought I was never going to get to eat here.  Finally we venture back, I got Red Velvet PanCAKE and hubby got a Shrimp BLT.  Same quality, taste and huge portions as their LA counterpart.  Our food was great but service could have been better.  Waiter wasn't the best and then kept the change without asking.  That was kinda weird to just assume I'm gonna give you a 34% tip on your shitty service.  I am a fan of Griddle Cafe and food was just as good as in LA so I will be back and hopefully the service was a fluke this time.
1876	0	a	"Once again a restaurant at the SLS fails.  Seated and then ignored by the wait staff.  I don't want the \"" LA experience\"" of being ignored."
1877	1	a	Best eggs benedict of all time. Also they have the best bacon. I will be visiting this place multiple times. Def get a side of bacon!!!
1878	1	a	Of course I have to first hear of this place in Las Vegas and not in Los Angeles; just learned last night about this place From my friend; it was 9pm and we wanted to go eat dinner someplace she had known of the Griddle in LA and really wanted to try it out b/c there was always a line for LA place I said really pancakes for dinner?? What the hell?? She was persistent and I gave it a try except it doesn't open until 11pm; did I wait it out until then?? Of course!! And it was worth the wait!! Even at 11pm a line started forming at the entrance ! At least it wasn't an hour long abt 10-15 min wait only; I ordered my favorite red velvet pancake that was topped w/ cream cheese icing we are not talking about your typical 3 stack pancake it was round plate size and amazingly delicious!
1879	0	a	Finally made it and it was just OK! Music was wayyyy tooooo loud. Plain waffle was very dry. Service was just OK. Will try one more time...I think.
1880	1	a	Had the French toast with Nutella, super yummy.... After the fourth bite it got toooo rich and sweet. Definitely a must try for Nutella lovers. Everything else looked pretty good too, my husband had the The caballero breakfast burrito, it was delicious. \n\nThe atmosphere made me feel like I was a mafia Mistress sitting in a modernized 70's cafe. The service was great and friendly. I recommend this cafe for sure. \n\nIf you ever come out to Vegas  you have to try this place at least once and check it out for yourself..
1881	1	a	If a place can be faulted for giving you too much of something this would be the place as no human could finish off the three huge pancakes they give you.  We shared the pancakes between 2 people and 2 others helped out who had gotten other food and we still had 1 pancake left.\n\nThe pancake was good as usually large pancakes can either be over done on the edges or underdone in the middle but this was cooked just right.  I also loved that they had real dark amber maple syrup. The french toast is a more human size as I finished that by myself at 2am in the morning.\n\nService was okay though it was so busy it was hard for them to be totally attentive through with the line outside you would figure they would want to turn over the tables as quick as possible.\n\nSince only other place serving breakfast atleast on weekdays is a coffee shop serving overpriced pastries this is a great option especially if in a group so can split the pancakes.
1882	1	a	Absolutely the best French Toast I have ever had..a definite do again...late night when need a bunch of carbs.
1883	1	a	Friendly service and yummy/huge pancakes.  I had the whole wheat pancakes (added blueberries).  Chose to sit at the bar since it was crowded, but that wasn't a problem since the staff at the bar was a fun group. Definitely want to come back to try more.
1884	0	a	I ordered a cheese and sausage omelet. I got a plate of melted cheese with sausage and egg on top. This place is overpriced and not worth it.
1885	1	a	There's a long wait to get seated but definitely worth it. The Bloody Mary was not great by any means but the food as amazing !!! I highly recommend the golden ticket pancake, it was huge so I recommend sharing.
1886	0	a	"Less is more. Unfortunately, the Griddle Cafe didn't get the memo.\n\nOrdered the \""Addicted to Noisella\"" French Toast. Too much Nutella, too much whipped cream, just too damn sweet!\n\nAlso ordered the simpler \""The Griddle\"" Waffle, which I found dry and bland.\n\nYes, portions are big, but more mediocre food, won't make the dish itself taste better."
1887	1	a	Really good! I just got the plain french toast and it was amazing! I loved the French press for my green tea. My only complaint would be the servers don't come around a whole lot, we got our order, our food and our check. I know they're kinda busy but I needed maple syrup and not a single server came near me and I had to grab a girl after she was taking someone else's order to get me some and I felt really bad. \n\nBut the food is A+!
1888	1	a	"Really good service. The fries were amazing with a delicious seasoning on them. We ordered the double \""banananana\"" pancake, the server recommended the double as it was only my husband and I. The pancakes were huge! I would say there was a little too much banana, we started eating the pancake edges towards the end.  The Muscle Bound Scramble was very watery and bland...but it was ok. We would go back!"
1889	0	a	"Came here to grab a quick bite, we were very hungry. First, waiter took 20 min just to take our order. All of us had tacos, 3 different kinds w/chips (Vomit) #1 Steak tacos, I have no idea what kind of meat that is but it was nasty. #2 The Avocados on top of the tacos were brown...#3 My shrimp in the tacos werent cooked all the way, the \""chips\"" that came with the tacos were nothing but dry greasy pita chips... they didnt even have Salsa to dip them in!!! How the heck am I supposed to eat the chips??? DRY??? He brought me Pico de Galo, which was old...the Earl Grey hot tea I asked for... was Extremely dark, to the point it was very bitter!!! Very Poor Quality of food... Don't waist  your money and save your stomach!!!! Yuk!!! \n\nI did NOT expect that from a spot that just remodeled and opened up! Change your menu, Definately change your Chef and please train your staf to be pleasant, polite and take orders on time!"
1890	1	a	Staff was amazing coffee was great BUT I ordered a fruit bowl and the fruit def was NOT fresh had a weird taste blehh! All of the other food looks amazing though! Def going back to try the red velvet pancakes
1891	1	a	Amazing food. Huge portions but not the best service and very loud inside. Waited a long time for our order to be taken and then our check. Also mimosas are tiny.
1892	1	a	It was our last day in Vegas.... we took the elevator down and headed straight for The Griddle Cafe. A quick wait while they cleaned up our table and we were seated in minutes. We'd passed it many times as we made our way around our hotel - so it was only right we made it at least once.\n\nFirst of all, the coffee is served in a French Press - you pay per cup (with endless refills)- we got about 6 cups out of on press - and it was more than enough. The coffee was delicious. There is some novelty in pressing your own coffee at the table - but it was really good coffee (strong and robust) and well worth the ~$4 per person.\n\nA couple folks around us ordered pancakes and they were literally the size of your head. I skipped the sweets and went for the Say Cheese omelet - it was massive, fluffy and STUFFED with cheese. It said 3 eggs but this must of been more...it was huge. Comes folded up and stuffed with Jack, Cheddar and Mozzarella. Comes with a side of potatoes and bread.\n\nWe were here onThanksgiving day - and while I felt a little bad the staff here was working on a holiday - they were all so on point that I left the server a very nice tip. I hope they closed up early and the staff got to make it home in time to spend time with their families.
1893	0	a	I have no idea as to why everyone is raving over this place.  I thought the food here was terrible!! We ordered the Oreo cookie pancakes, and yes, while they were big enough to feed 5 people, they were gross. Babystacks Caf\u00e9 blows this place out of the water when it comes to pancakes.  Next, the bacon was over cooked and tasted like shoe leather. Finally, the breakfast potatoes.  They were so bad, I asked the server to remove them from the bill which she promptly did. I would not return here even if you paid me. As I said, Babystacks is so much better.
1894	1	a	"We had breakfast on a Sunday around 10am it's a wait if your party of 4!or more. Hubby and I didn't wait long  maybe less than 10 minutes. Harlon provided great service I will definitely go back to sit in his section.\nFood: it's HUGE!!! People they are not kidding, it's no joke! You have been warned. It's best to share. I had  egg whites scrambled with turkey sausage, spinach and green onions it's on the bland side but nothing with a sprinkle of flavored salt couldn't fix. The egg whites cooked perfectly soft. OK! I almost fainted seeing the two slices of French toast  with butter and sprinkled with powder sugar it's 8\"" a size of a dinner plate holly its gigantic, it was good but no way we can finish that. I can see three to four people sharing that French toast. Hubby had egg Benedict with ham and bake potatoes skins. He expressed he couldn't find the one egg , it was smothered in thick white sauce. He clearly didn't like his meal. Not many restaurants offer fresh squeezed OJ anymore so when I read they have that on the menu I must have it. Fresh squeezed OJ I felt refreshed to start my morning of. Is it just me or it's just WAY to loud in Griddle Cafe I'm struggling to hear my husband talk I'm competing with my table mates on both sides of me. The music I love it. Love listening to the tune. Wish the volume turned down 3 or 4 notches just way to noisy."
1895	0	a	"Ok, I'll be honest: was the French Press coffee a bold, flavorful, amazing taste of torrefaction Heaven in a cup? Yes. Was it worth five bucks? Sure. I had the Tequila Sunrise plate. The flavors were all there. The chicken sausage was a nice bonus and had a pleasurable kick of spice in each bite. I had it with a side of avocado (a Huevos Rancheros must), so the total for the dish alone came to $16.50. Therein comes my gripe. This is breakfast, people. If I laid that amount of cash down at Hash House or Cracked Egg, I would have literally busted a gut. The presentation of the dish was underwhelming. The beans were literally a layer to separate the eggs from the tortilla. No rice. No pico. Not even a sprig of cilantro. I think the key missing element was a couple extra tortillas to sop up the alcohol-infused sauce. That may have even bumped my rating up another star. It just needed a lil \""somethin\"", besides the price, to remind me that I was eating at a Strip establishment. Overall, the dining area was appealing and clean, a kind of diner-chic feel, with easy access from the parking garage. Nakisha was my server. She was prompt, friendly, smiley (but not over-smiley ;) ) and basically on-point. No complaints there. If I give this place a second chance, it will probably be at the LA location, after a night of heavy  carousing. ;)"
1896	1	a	Came to Vegas for air show , friend recommend me to try this cafe , my friend was right , this place is good!!! The portion of the food was huge and delicious. For sure I am going there again when I am visiting Vegas !
1897	1	a	Amazing food and service.  Stephanie went out of her way to accommodate our large group. Best food in Vegas.
1898	1	a	Over the top pancakes bigger than the plate they serve it on. You don't even need the stack one would serve a couple people. They do have great flavors and they suggest to start in the middle which was a great idea. I've never eaten a pancake like that. The hot chocolate is for a child. Purely sugar and chocolate resin all over the bottom. It's just a giant mess. I do like that serve coffee in a french press. It's a nice touch. The hostesses on the other hand are in their own world. We walked up and they didn't acknowledge us, just finished their conversation about their lives.
1899	1	a	Came here for brunch with the familia. Portions are huge and the flavor of the food is larger. We were taken care of by the super attentive manager, Adam. Top notch service! Everybody loved their food and the French press coffee is amazing. Definitely recommend giving it a try!
1900	1	a	Great place for breakfast!  I love french toast (realizing it's pretty hard to mess it up) and this was one of best I've had. I went with the basic just to see how it stacks up to my fave (Mon Ami brunch) and it was comparable for sure. The portions are huge so my breakfast turned into lunch and dinner! They have great coffee - french press is my go-to at home so it's nice to have it at a restaurant. Server was a little slow to return at first, it was still early morning and it wasn't very busy so I would've expected a more prompt return but she never left us hanging after that. will return for sure!
1901	0	a	The food was good considering it is a buffet. Nice ambiance. The desserts weren't as good as the other buffets I've been to on the strip; kinda boring. For the $$$, definitely not worth it! For being a new buffet on the strip they really should've brought something new and different from the rest.
1902	1	a	locals here in las vegas and decided to check out the new SLS & decided on brunch at the buffet. Beautiful decor,  Friendly staff , handsome managers & great food.  Must spend the extra $12 for the unlimited bloody mary and mimosa!  crepe station was a lovely touch you don't see everywhere. Love great customer service, so when manager greets us & asks how we are doing. ...it's a big plus.  Can't wait to come back for dinner.
1903	1	a	Came here for brunch when they opened and it was wonderful! Great and personable staff, which is SO rare for a buffet. They had a bunch of yummy breakfast stuff my boyfriend and I really enjoyed. They also had mostly Asian food out for lunch, and it included sushi! It was only $45 for the two of us, and for being on the strip as well as the quality, that was the cherry on top. I will be back to try dinner.
1904	0	a	Paid holiday brunch price for Breakfast on Labor Day Weekend and it is a decent buffet but doesnt measure up to Wynn, Bellagio, M Resort, Aria, Cosmo, Caesars considering the similar premium prices.  So many buffets to choose from in Vegas and there is nothig special about this buffet that would warrant a driving north.    \n\nNote: Mimosa and Bloody Marys were not included in the premium price.  \n\nAlso note while most casinos reward programs  like Cosmo and MLife reward you for spending money when you dine,  SLS does not.
1905	1	a	Hotel just opened last week, so this buffet is brand new. So place is still very clean. I tried the brunch, cost per person  $31 plus tax. \n\nService is good. Staff is friendly and very attentive, which always a plus these places. \n\nFood selection,  I feel they need to add more selection or spread.   Flavor is good though . I am comparing to  My favorite buffet which is Wicked spoon, next is Bacchanal. \n\nI think we need to come back for dinner. This place looks promising.
1906	0	a	"weak selection and lackluster in taste on most \""hot entree\"" items and they didn't serve them hot - desserts mediocre at best and selection was .... \""yawn\""  - service was \""ok\""  however after drink refills - nobody was bussing plates or table touching,  ask for a manger and was told there unavailable at this time.   \n\nfloored -"
1907	0	a	Alright SLS you made an impact making this sahara hotel something new but when you want more people to come here you gotta be a big hit. unfortunately the  food did not hit the spot. the only thing was good was the hostess that gave us 2 for 1 because we are locals that came out to about $32 for two people otherwise it would have been $30 a person i really would have been dissapointed if i paid that price and ate the food not liking it...they need to have more varieties and food was bland. i will say this though i had this custard crossiant that was delish and they offered crepes on the spot those were good features for sunday brunch i guess
1908	0	a	The Skinny: meager selection with 2 outstanding items for a regular $30/person brunch or $40/person dinner (2) service/ambience: okay, kind of inconsistent service with bad live music at dinner (2) value: okay if you are a local and take advantage of their 2 for 1 deal...otherwise too pricey for what you get (2)\n\nFYI - they serve Pepsi products here.\n\nWe came here to experience the 2 for 1 locals buffet deal. We came in at the tail end of the brunch to take a look at their brunch items and their dinner selection.\n\nConsidering the bounty of high end buffets on the Strip, the relatively meager offerings for the price was the first thing that struck me as I checked out the selection. However the main question is does the quality make up for it?\n\nThe hubs tried their cold cuts and cheese selection which were a decided pass. The salads were okay while the smoked salmon selection were surprisingly bland. Snow crab legs were plentiful. Oysters and cooked mussels were offered during dinner that I did not try. Checked out their Italian section which consisted of 3 types of pasta (meh) and some really anemic looking pizza.\n\nSauteed vegetables were not good. Zucchini were cut  haphazardly and too large to cook evenly. Not a fan of the super charred cauliflower. The broccolini with almonds were okay.\n\nThe Indian offerings of chicken makhani(poorly spiced, not smoky and not rich enough), cauliflower curry (bland), chicken biryani (dry and scary looking) cannot compare to any standard $11 Indian lunch buffet in terms of quality not to mention price. And this takes up a good amount of space. Sushi was okay - your standard AYCE joint off Strip is still way better due to pre made too long factor at the buffet. The Chinese food was slightly better quality than your regular buffet offerings however still not great. \n\nFor roasted meats, I was surprised that the prime rib was so overdone. The closest to rare was basically medium well. Ribs were too dry.\n\nThe only savory thing that was outstanding for me was their Peking chicken (yes, chicken! No duck) The five spice powder/ crispy skin made for a flavorful combination.\n\nDuring brunch they did have some fruit available however with dinner there was no fruit to be found.\n\nDessert was a disappointment in general. For the diabetics, there are no sugar free options.Their brownies were more cake like. The peach cobbler used canned peaches with too much nutmeg and it had this really bad greasy pie crust on top. That is not peach cobbler! To be honest I am not sure what to call it. Bread pudding was too texturally mushy while the panna cotta was overly solid.\n\nCupcakes were a wash. The so-called Boston cream cupcake were plain flavorless yellow cake mix with substandard chocolate frosting. No custard or pudding....WTF? Red velvet with cream cheese frosting was also quite bad and rather bland. Yeah, don't ask me how that happened but there it is.\n\nThe crepe batter was weird. Not enough butter and eggs made for a poorer texture. The cold goopy caramelized bananas did not help as well and would have been better just cut fresh. The crepes themselves were misshapened and relatively uneven in thickness.\n\nThe ice cream/gelato selection was limited to about 6 flavors of which none were really worth going back for (tried Nutella, mint chip, strawberry, cookies and cream). Artificial and icy in texture, Haagen Daz or Talenti from the supermarket tastes better.\n\nThe best thing here was the fried mini donuts with cinnamon and sugar. Light and crispy, we waited an hour into dinner service before this was available. Glad we waited for it.\n\nOur server was quite good in the beginning however she was slow to refill glasses and remove our plates after about an hour. Seeing as how the restaurant was only 50% capacity, it was kind of weird. Ambience wise, they brought out some bad live music performer who did crappy covers of Eric Clapton and George Michael during dinner service. Unfortunately it was rather loud especially when he failed to hit the high notes.\n\nGiven how we paid half price, the experience was okay for what we paid. However at full price? Definitely not worth the price of admission. Considering your plethora of options out there, I would rather pay more for a better quality product. Instead making rather poor renditions of various ethnic food that is done better and cheaper elsewhere, they should really focus on improving the quality of their basics first (ie, roasted meats, pizza, pastas, ice cream offerings) and add a few kid friendly items like a really good macaroni and cheese.\n\nThe buffet shows signs of struggling as they now only open 3 days a week (Friday-Sunday). I guess that is why they are offering 2 for 1 for locals. As much as I'd like the new kid in town to succeed, I still would have to give it a 2 star review in comparison to much better options around town.
1909	1	a	My husband and I went to the buffet on a Thursday night. It's located on the 2nd floor. ..kinda secluded. I could smell the aroma of fresh doughnuts down the hall. The buffet is a bit pricey about 40 a person but we're locals so we got a buy one get one! The selection isn't as large as most buffets but the quality was on point!!! The food was very flavorful. .even the pizza..so darn good! I loved the pasta and the grilled cauliflower with bacon yum! They make there own pastries...I wanted to take some cookies n cream Gelato with me and the gave me a to go cup and filled it up:) One of the guys working named sonny was so friendly and he talked with us for a bit...thank you sonny for making a great night more memorable!  Will definitely be going back.
1910	0	a	From reading everyone review make me thing I could be wrong. But after trying this over-price buffet I would give it a zero if yelp would allow me. \nFor starter, they were under staff on Sunday night. The food selections was EXTREMELY small in portion. Which does not meet the qualification of ALL YOU CAN EAT. They kept running out of foods. I had to go back three times before I got any crab leggs. They ran out of spoon for soup. Had to go back to ask for spoons. In the dim sum section, they was nothing but empt bamboo container. No dim sum. I see everyone else with fried noodles, sushi, pork hash. Yet when you get there. There's nothing left. Like I said I had to go back three time before I got what I want. Not a lot of option on food items on this buffet. The Indian section was poor selection. Cauliflower curry? Really? Not enough flavor in any of the dishes. \nAlso it was an hour into my meal before I got my drinks refill, I didn't even know who my server was. The hostess took my drinks order when I got back from getting my foods the first round my drinks was there. \nAs for the desert, twenty thumbs down. I got crepes which was poorly made by the pastery maker. The batter was not mix right. Mine look like it's been drop and poke with twenty forks. He had to confident to give it to me. Wow! My mouth dropped. I can't bake. I could of done a better job. I would of been embarrassed to service myself yet someone else with crepes that look like that. I really like the small portion of the deserts but again, it took me forever to find spoons to eat those tastely deserts. The red velvet cupcake was hard as a rock. Everything else was so bland. Not enough flavor, sugars to call it deserts. \nFor the price they charge you're better off at Wicked Spoons.. better yet pay the extra $20 more at Bachannal. Get your money worth. I'm a local and I work in travel industry myself. I like to explore different restaurants to recommend to my customers. Unfortunately I would not recommend SLS buffet. I was truly disappointment I was $43 plus tips. The quality of the foods where not there. I can't think one single items I was in wow off that makes me want to go back.
1911	0	a	Regular price is $40. Got the 2-for-1 special. Otherwise, I wouldn't go. None of it was good but it wasn't awful though. I just wouldn't pay $40 for what I got. The best part was probably the prime rib and gelato.
1912	0	a	We TRIED to go to the buffet on Tuesday eve for dinner, but found it was closed Mon-Thurs.  This wouldn't have been so bad if it weren't for the fact there is absolutely NO signage informing you of this until you make the ridiculously long trek down multiple hallways to get to the entrance.  WTF, SLS?!
1913	0	a	Sunday night Buffet was boring, waiter don't pick up use plates like other buffet do. Foods are not attractive, mostly overcooked veggie, rice, pasta and beans. Indian biriyani ...are you kidding I cook better than upscale restaurant.  I paid for unlimited drink charge on my stay, don't know where is the bar is. Not much helping waiters. I'm not big fan of buffet but trying to see what they offers at newly open luxury hotel. Don't waste your money go Taco stand or McDonald
1914	1	a	"Got it for free...sign up with their play card \""The Code\"" and get 500 points..u will get 2 free buffets good for 48 hours. I played $100 and it got me to 1000 points. If u don't use it, u will play $40...bottomless mimosas for $12"
1915	1	a	This is a great buffet! Although nearly every casino hotel in Vegas has a buffet, the SLS Buffet falls in the rare category of special. Upon walking down the buffet line, you realize that the dishes make sense and complement each other...it's like the chef is telling you a story, and it's a delicious journey!\n\nThe buffet doesn't have the varied selections like Bacchanal or Bellagio, but it has its own personality. There could be more cold options, but the meat and cheese display is fantastic! I love soups, and there was an abundant selection of soups...4 types if you count the cioppino.\n\nThe prime rib is fantastic. It beats Wicked Spoon hands down, and it's perfect! The seasonings are excellent, the meat is naturally tender and the flavor is exactly the way prime rib should taste...heaven!\n\nThe crab legs were kind of unimpressive; and the shrimp cocktail was slightly overcooked but seasoned well. The seafood boil was overcomplicated, and the oysters were standard fare.\n\nI was a bit confused with the Indian cuisine...I remember when Aria tried to do Indian, but Aria had delicious naan bread!\n\nThe best section was the Chinese section...it felt like an authentic dim sum restaurant! Chicken feet, pork knuckles, and other tasty Asian treats. Most impressive!!!\n\nWe got to meet Adam, the GM of the SLS Buffet. What an awesome guy! Service was good because of Adam. Adam explained the concept, decor, and the whole thought process. There is so much potential for this place!\n\nA few more options to choose, and less steamed rice (they had basmati rice, jasmine rice, and brown rice).\n\nCan't wait to come back and see what else is new and improved next time!
1916	1	a	Greath\nGood and great food seafood and service I highly recommend dinning at the sls buffet
1917	0	a	I'm  a firm believer of second chances ..that's what I did with SLS buffet ..but it was a disappointment they have Indian section and being Indian myself its horrible ... Basmati rice is not cooked right and to begin with it's not basmati I have eaten rice all my life and if you can't get the rice right you can't serve good Indian food. Dessert was another disappointment other than raspberry gelato everything else did not have any taste . It's over priced  and bad food . The reason I gave 2 stars was for the staff and ambience
1918	0	a	"UPDATE: THIS BUFFET HAS TEMPORARILY CLOSED!\n\nhttp://vegas.eater.com/2014/11/10/7189237/and-now-for-the-first-shutter-at-sls-las-vegas\n\nSLS president Scott Kreeger said the second-floor location \""is doing OK, but not hitting out of the park\"" as compared to the other hotel-casinos restaurants.\n\nNo doubt!  Have any of these wizards even been to a competitor's buffet to see where they went so wrong??"
1919	1	a	Great place, everyone was so friendly and attentive. The price special 2 for 1 for locals comes down to $20.00 a person. The food is very good and vegetables are fresh not overcooked, my boyfriend and I went on a Saturday night and fell in love with their Prime Rib and desserts.
1920	0	a	Disappointing. For $39.99 per person, they should be ashamed of themselves to charge so much for such a small, weak selection of food. We went on Sunday, the last day before they closed. \n\nI hope whoever is in charge of SLS and their buffet reads into not just Yelp reviews, but any type of feedback they can access to.\n\nPersonally, I don't think it's the location that made SLS Buffet version1.0 a failure. I mean, look at the other popular buffets locations in other hotels on the strip. Cosmopolitan's Wicked Spoon buffet comes to mind. Isn't their location out in the boonies? Or look at Planet Hollywood's Spice Market Buffet. They, too, also have to take an escalator to get to their buffet area. All in all, it's really the  QUALITY and VARIETY of what you bring to the table (literally). \n\nOnce entering into the buffet dining area, I noticed a change of...theming. All of a sudden....I thought I was eating at some restaurant in the cabin/woods. I thought I even saw some deer or buffalo heads mounted on the walls??? =/ What the...?! Tables looked very picnic-esque. \n\nAlso, it felt like just because it was the last night, employees were slacking....or they simply just don't give a F%*# anymore. Case in point: soup section. Here I am....seeing two different types of chowders all dried and crusted. But my crazy ass still wanted to give it a try. Okay but um...where are the spoons?? I told the girl that was behind the counter they were out of soup spoons. She said okay and disappeared. I waited for 5-7 minutes. There was no sight of her. I'd still be there waiting if they didn't close this place down. So I drank my soup like a barbarian...basically I slurped it up. LOL! And omg...it tasted like it was STRAIGHT FROM A CAN and it was probably two days old. I was horrified.\n\nNothing looked fresh. They labeled some chicken to be curry chicken. I thought, great! I'm a big fan of curry. Once I got to my table, the chicken was 100%  NOT curry!!!!!! It was full on tomato sauce chicken. WTF!? Ugh...disappointed once more.\n\n\nSeriously, QUALITY, QUALITY, QUALITY, SLS. I'm glad we went when they had a 2 for 1 locals special. Don't charge a general price of $40 per person for dinner when really....tourists WILL go to somewhere that's at least 3x better; even if they have to pay an additional $10. \n\nCharging Wicked Spoon pricing for a Station buffet. Wow. WHAT WERE YOU THINKING!?!
1921	1	a	Banana Monkey Bread\nBear Claw\nChocolate Cranberry Scone\n\nLocated just past the entrance of the new SLS and slinging LAMill Coffee from 6am until ten o'clock in the evening every day of the week it was largely a result of my early arrival for breakfast at The Griddle Caf\u00e9 that brought me to the cusp of The Perq and although I knew the meal to follow was bound to be hearty I simply couldn't resist the combination of warm pastries and welcoming baristas, the results a three part order tasted on site and finished later in the day with across-the-board impressive results.  In some ways a bizarre space with a long bar juxtaposing the coffee counter and several small tables laid out beneath a textured ceiling gleaming with light The Perq concept is one set to evolve with progression of the day and reportedly baking fresh every ninety minutes (or faster as supply demands) with breakfast transitioning to lunch around 11:00am it was to nearly a dozen warm options that I was tempted at 6:15 and although a pair of fruit tarts beckoned along with a truffled Gruyere scone my order eventually settled on items far more sweet, the fresh scone pocketed with spots of sugar and dollops of butter alongside dark chocolate and bursting berries providing a lovely first bite before I delved into a well laminated bearclaw filled with dense yet subtle frangipane that stands tall alongside that of Henderson's Friendly Donuts for best in the city, though the Strip based Casino admittedly commands nearly three times the price.  Indulging last in a selection warmed-and-topped-to-order it was finally in The Perq's caramel topped banana monkey bread that I partook and although rumor has it that lunch fares even better than breakfast with cookies, desserts, and gelato-panini taking center stage I'd be hard pressed to imagine any of them better than the textbook brioche pull-apart studded with caramelized bananas, though I unquestionably plan to return and find out, and next time with a cold-brew in hand.
1922	0	a	As I stood in line to sample the gelato, I noticed there was stepped on pastries and drops of blood on the floor. Both appeared to have been there for a while and I wondered why it was not taken care of because Perq was empty. The gelato sample I was given was minuscule so I could hardly tell if I really liked the gelato. I was thinking about buying a cookie but after seeing the $4.75 price tag I did not see the value. \n\nI ended up speaking to the director of operations and asked why the cookie was priced highly and all he said was he never had a chocolate chip cookie he didn't like. I was hoping he would tell me the quality of ingredients and taste are worth the price. He didn't do a good job convincing me to buy the cookie nor did I feel like he valued my business so I left. If Perq wants to survive charging inflated prices they need to maintain the cleanliness of the shop and be able to sell their product.
1923	1	a	Staff is really friendly and the strawberry rhubarb danish was so good!
1924	1	a	"Hopefully you are only a coffee addict.  After all, you could have the double duty of caffeine addiction and gambling, and that would be awfully bad.\n\nComing to Perq (I refuse to say the \""the\"" in front), is plenty worth the wait.  You see, your kinda held captive, as it's the only offering of coffee in the hotel.  The line on weekends is 10-20 deep on weekends, so there's no quick fix.\n\nA small bakery selection, and all the regular stuff (espresso, lattes), with one special feature, a Liquor Affogato, and I can only imagine what its like.\n\nCute attire + nice design - no WIFI = 4.0 stars."
1925	0	a	Since this is the only coffee shop in the casino you are likely going to end up ordering here if you just want a danish and coffee and not the buffett on weekends or Griddle Cafe.  There is a Mcdonalds and Starbucks within walking distance and an IHOP if willing to walk a couple of blocks toward the stratosphere.\n\nThis place is pricey as my ham and cheese croissant was 650 and a regular croissant was 350.  Even in NYC where i live you can get  a better croissant for around 250 at Hot and Crusty.  Neither the ham and cheese or an apple turnover was even heated which alteast would have made this obviously previously frozen pasties edible.  Only reason I ate here twice was with a friend who has gold status at Hilton so had a 15 dollar credit and he was nice enough to share his money with me. I only could find one plus which for a coffee shop in this day and age is a no no.  Only reason gets 2 stars was coffee was not bad and atleast had enough seats.
1926	0	a	"Rarely do I make the effort to write a review, and usually I do because Ive had the worse experience ever. That was the case today. First they were scheduled to open at 6a.m but wasnt ready until roughly 6:45, which force a number of us to wait. I ordered a vanilla latte, and the barista said she didnt have flavor lattes but only regular latte and that I would have to wait 30 minutes for a flavor latte. I proceded to get a regular latte and underneath her tongue she said \""asshole\"". Now, all I asked her was a simple question. I wont be going back here and to SLS anytime soon. Not only food quality was poor but their customer service reaked."
1927	0	a	I tried to visit The Perq at 6am when it was advertised to be open. To my dismay, they were not open but still preparing to open. I waited patiently for this place to be open even after 6am but gave up when it was evident that the workers were busy having a drawn out conversation instead of opening. Instead, I went to the Griddle Cafe to get some food and by the time I came back, it was still not open. If the hotel advertises The Perq to be open at 6am, it should be open at 6am.\n\nI wanted to give this place a second chance so I came back another day in the morning. There was a decent size line. Unfortunately, all the croissants and pretty much all the food for that matter was gone. It was definitely slim pickings in terms of pastries. I was disappointed that I didn't get to eat. Instead I had purchased a pumpkin spice latte. It was okay, but would have preferred it from Starbucks across the street. I love the decor and ambiance, but I need some food and also be open when advertised.
1928	1	a	I used to work near there other location and when it closed and said they were moving I hoped to be able to find. Then while driving home one day from work I saw the new location, and boy was I happy, its within my work commute and close enough to make a regular lunch time stop. \n\nI stopped one morning on the way to work and was happy to see they have a drive thru, I ordered a egg, potato and cheese burrito and had pico de gallo added to it. I have to say it was a great tasting breakfast burrito.\n\nA few days later I met up with my friend for lunch and I ordered the #20, it's a carne asada burrito with beans and rice, this did not disappoint! So good!  \n\nI'm pleased to see Salazar Bros back, its great seeing everyone, and loving the new spot!
1929	1	a	I used to eat at Salazar Bros over 10 years ago and just recently rediscovered it.  They are just as awesome now as they were then!  Great food, big portions at a very reasonable price.  The restaurant is very clean and the service is fast and friendly.  I'll definitely be going back...a lot!
1930	1	a	I am falling more in love with this place each and every day. Super clean eating area and the back area looks spanking clean too. Friendly service, great burritos, and the tamales are soo soo good. Smells like Mexican Food Heaven in here my friends - good for a quick breakfast/lunch bite or late night grub after a night on the town.
1931	1	a	Salazar Bros food comes faster and fresher than the competition up the street. They are also more friendly. I have only had carne asada burritos,  quesadillas, and enchiladas so far and all were delicious. The meat was tender.. and the beans were magical ;) oh ya and the sauce is titties. Get drunk and try this shit out b
1932	1	a	This place opened up a few months ago so I finally went in to give it a try. Walking in I notice its very nice and clean. The food was better than I expected. I had the 2 Carne Asada taco plate with beans and rice included. The tacos had pico de gallo and guacamole on them included. Everything was delicious. My boyfriend had the Shrimp Burrito which we asked if they would make it a Chimichanga and they did even though it wasn't on the menu. The Shrimp Chimichanga came with shrimp, rice, tartar sauce, pico de gallo, sour cream, guacamole and cheese. He said it was amazingly good. We are definitely going back plus very close by to us.
1933	1	a	Finally! We have a chipotle in the East side. I love chipotle, but this one tops many that I have been to. On all the occasions I've been here they have never been stingy with their portions. I always ask for extra hot sauce and corn and they truly do give me extra. Restaurant is always clean and workers work at a fast paste. I would definitely come back.
1934	1	a	I don't own a gun but I've shot a few bullseyes using my bf's PX4 storm.  He wanted to check out the new local gun shop since we're frequent shoppers in this plaza. \n\nEmployees are really friendly,  helpful & appreciative of their customers.  They know their customers by name.  Perfect! \n\nDecided I need some sort of protection,  so I bought pepper spray for $8.06 after tax. I was surprised how competitive the prices are.  Love it!
1935	1	a	Went there last night to buy ammo and a gift card. The people there are so nice and helpful ! I will send every one I know there and alway come back ! It was great going in to there store and being able to find what I needed and not having to wait!
1936	1	a	I have been going to Inferno Hot Pilates for almost 1year. I was having a hard time loosing that stubborn 10-15 lbs & the cyclone spin 45 min class really helped bump up that extra burn I needed. It's a fun class if you like to jam to music, glow in the black lights and get a good sweat. I do 2 classes a week of cyclone spin for (cardio with heavy resistance) alternating hot Pilates, bikini bottom, & lifting on my own. \nThe cyclone mix class is equally amazing, as you work hard on the bike for 30 minutes then move to bootcamp work!!!  It's tough, but awesome! \nI love the friend like atmosphere with Gabi and all the inferno peeps always pushing each other to be better everyday!! It's inspiring and keeps me coming back for more!!! :-)
1937	1	a	Best class in the valley,, been doing this class for 3 weeks now & love it and love Gabi & Julie,, thanks for a great workout !
1938	1	a	Can't say enough good things about this class! I don't usually stray from my hot Pilates and I'm not a cardio lover but I'm addicted to cyclone!!! Love it!! I really love the cyclone boot camp. I've seen incredible changes in by body. This class is a must try. You won't be disappointed! It's so fun!!!
1939	1	a	Cyclone Bootcamp will leave you soaked and strong!  1/2 of the class is the most fun cycling you will ever do with motivating music and black lights.  Your having so much fun you forget it's a workout!  The 2nd 1/2 is resistance training with kettlebels or TRX... and more cardio... Burpees anyone? Gabi always makes it interesting and always challenges us to safely push out of our comfort zones.  A must try for any fitness level.
1940	1	a	Amazing!  Lots of exercises on the bike, variety of speeds & resistance,  wonderful  energy. The music is awesome,  plus black lights...so fun & a great workout.
1941	1	a	I have been to a number of different spin classes at various gyms in Las Vegas and Cyclone is definitely unique from the others and also one of my favorite classes!  Gabi has amazing energy to keep you going through the class.  She is constantly switching positions so you don't get bored on the bike and she incorporates a lot of arm movements for a great total body workout.  She choreographs the spinning with the music and dims the lights, creating a fun atmosphere.  The 45 minutes goes by very quickly!  I highly recommend!
1942	1	a	When you walk in the aroma of fresh baked goods hits you immediately, followed by a friendly greeting and smile - what a great start!\n\nNext, I'm offered a sample, I try the strawberry puff pastry, as I bite into it, I realize it's still warm! Wow!\n\nSold! I bought 4 and they threw in 2 more for good measure.\n\nI also bought an Apple Napple [my 808 peeps know all about these!]\n\nI'm definitely coming back to buy specialty items from them in the near future! :)
1943	1	a	Tracy is amazing! She took me from almost black, to almost platinum blonde in 2 visits without damaging my hair! I've been to her multiple times now and she always listens to what I want and actually does it, unlike some stylists who just do what they want. Best bob cut I've ever had
1944	0	a	My husband and I walked in on the grand opening and were the only one's there. All the food was cold ,the noodles were gummy ,and customer service wasn't all that great.We both agreed to give them another chance if we ever see the place filled with customers because the food is bearable and its close by the house.
1945	0	a	This was King which had decent service and acceptable if not great food. I was in the Plaza and saw Sakura is now open. It was truly sad  While a brand new business may not be able to keep the steam table food fresh if  there are virtually no diners. there has to be some level of interest and or service.\nI spoke my weak Mandarin greeting and also tried to make conversation with the male host. With possibly two other booths or tables occupied I was seated next to a man who truly was asleep during my entire visit.\nWaitress was seated within eye view with a second waitress. Both playing with their mobil phones. My waitress spoke English but did not say three words to me and did not even take my plate away until after I was on my third plate. No one said a word as I walked by  the host and another employee. They saw me but I might as well have been leaving in a box. The octopus and salmon were very good.  Most food was barely passable to sub par.They have done a nice job with their renovation and greatly increased the number of steam tables. They might have saved their money,\nleft it as it was, and concentrated on food and service to start. Price was modest but I would not want it if it was free. I was there at 5 PM. If you want to try the place you might walk by the steam tables first  prior to being seated. I hope your experience is much better than minem
1946	0	a	Decided to try this tonight because we received a coupon for a free meal. My advice - it's not worth going even if it's free.\n\nWe were greeted and seated. With many empty tables around, we were seated at one that was dirty and sticky. When I asked about beer choices, the hostess had to look across the restaurant at the cooler. Served beer with chilled glasses, but we opted to drink out of the cleaner looking bottles.\n\nFood was sub-par, at best. Nothing was great, or even good. My son, who will literally eat just about everything and loves all manner of Asian food, went for the pizza after trying several options. I've never seen him leave so much on his plate!\n\nMany of the options weren't labeled, like the flavors of ice cream, sushi rolls, etc. One thing that weirded me out - the chocolate fountain with marshmallows sat right next to the marinated octopus.  Not so appetizing! \n\nThe ambiance was similar to an old Kmart diner, especially the lighting. There was masking tape covering holes in the wall and post - it notes numbering the tables. The wire mesh condiment holders on the tables still had the price tags on them.\n\nI could continue, but there is no point. Won't ever return.
1947	0	a	Sadly very very bad! Was hoping for better food, but no! Not going back any time soon
1948	0	a	I went back for a third time today, Saturday at 1:30 PM.The second visit was really bad. Today was better but only up to 2*s.This time there might have been as many customers as employees? On my 2nd visit I did not get the senior discount even after\nagain requesting it  Today again told the lifeless \nhost I am a senior. My bill again was full price but was adjusted. The waitress works hard and is pleasant but zero contact  beyond plate pick up. I again enterred and left with two words being said.Thevfood was passable to poor. There was nothing good.\nI am very easy to please.
1949	1	a	Good food, buffet style. Restaurant is very empty for a Friday night, could be because it's Halloween. Some items in the buffet are not labeled so minus one star. Happy otherwise!
1950	0	a	Food was fairly cold, came here because my parents wanted to have those all you can eat crab which was completely unfresh, but what can you expect from a 10 dollar buffet? The only thing that was decently good was from the habachi grill and the 2.79 beer which was great but apart from that, server was meh. And the oyster was dry as well. 2 stars cause of the beer though.
1951	0	a	This was the worst buffet I have been to yet! The food was old and odd tasting. When I go to a buffet I expect mediocre food but this stuff was inedible. We went there because we got a Bogo coupon in the mail that had multiple pictures of crab legs on it which left me to believe there would be crab legs for the dinner buffet. There were not. I've never been scared that I might get food poisoning from something I ate until tonight. I'm crossing my fingers I don't.  This is the first time I left a buffet still hungry because I couldn't stand to eat more than one bite of anything I tried. The atmosphere was really weird too. There was music playing and tv's playing prime time shows with the volume on. I'm just glad that I had the coupon and didn't pay full price or I would have been really bummed. Never again!
1952	0	a	First of all, who trains the wait staff here?!? I've come a few times and the service is disastrous! Going 20 minutes without water is atrocious when there's only 4 other tables. Also, leaving the check on the table is fine when we aren't even halfway done eating, but to then interrupt our conversation 10 minutes later and ask that we pay the bill now, is rude. And whoever their male server is...is the worst! He brings you the check, takes your card and then hovers over your shoulder when you're filling out the receipt. What is wrong with you?! Like I said, who allows to let these people serve! \nXnejfieokefnfilwnrr\nAnyways, the buffet food is actually pretty okay,especially for 8.00 a lunch. They have fresh shrimp, a sushi bar (basic rolls) and then everything they have a typical Chinese lunch buffet, they also have a chocolate fountain which I haven't tried, I don't know how sanitary that is when I've seen little kids sticking their fingers in it. No thank you. They have a habachi grill as well, where you get to choose your ingredients and they cook it for you, but both times I've eaten from it my food was extremely overcooked and inedible.\nI may come back to get a to-go box, 1lb is 4.75, much cheaper to get a pound of fresh shrimp here than it is at the grocery store. Just saying. \nBut the service here....yuck.
1953	0	a	the service here was great but it is slightly declining with every visit, (losing that newcar smell) I believe I will probably go out of my way to travel 15 mi back to my regular joint.
1954	1	a	Valentin does phenomenal work! I ordered a couple of cheap suits online for a deal that was too good to pass up and he made them look like a million bucks. He took all the tags off and hemmed the pants and now I am stylin' and profilin'! I will definitely be back soon!
1955	1	a	The service and food were fantastic.  I heard this place was good and the Bazaar was limited to late night menu so we tried this place.\nWe ordered a slew of food and everything was good.  I am not even a big lamb eater and that was good.  \nThe sirloin or steak dish was like a party in my mouth.  We had a semi private room at the front and it was just a good time.\nThe naan they give you is some of the best I've had. \nThe only thing I wasn't a fan of is the bday desert I had.  It wasn't bad just not great.  I would definitely do this place over again and again.
1956	0	a	To make it simple, we were not too pleased that we had to wait 45 minutes for our RESERVATION...
1957	1	a	A must-try menu. If you're looking for an awesome fusion of flavors, diverse staff and waitresses, affordable (for tapas) and an extremely comfortable setting..then this is your place. The menu will cater to any pallet, so don't think it's strictly Mediterranean cuisine.
1958	1	a	YUM!! Best Med food I've ever had in Vegas. Great service. Chicken Tangine was amazing...excellent Humus and Pita was perfect!
1959	1	a	Great food!! Great ambience in the little side tables with the great chandeliers. Only complaint was the strange lag time where our waitress disappeared and we really wanted to order more. Other than that, fantastic food! We'll be back!
1960	1	a	This place is awesome!!!! Everything n I mean everything I ordered was spot on. We had a group of 8 and our servers were on it. The skewers were all great, the hummus was to die for, and the best thing u must order is the bone marrow. Like heaven in my mouth!!!!
1961	1	a	Probably the best meal I have had in Vegas, and that says something. Went with a group of 5 and did not know what to expect. The best I can describe the experience is fusion Med meets Tapas. \n\nStarted with two dips, hummus and cucumber/yogurt. The pita was great, not too chewy, just perfect. Both dips were excellent.\n\nThen we had spanakopita and spicy cigars. Possibly the best spanakopita I have ever had and the cigars were like meat filled sping rolls, everyone loved them.\n\nWe then had the Brussels sprouts, which even the most carnivorous of us loved. They were crispy shaved Brussels sprouts, reminded me of terrific fried kale I once had at Benny's in Chicago. \n\nOur two meat dishes were also great. Lamb tagine with cous cous was both tender and flavorful. My favorite dish, and most surprising, was the duck bastilla, hard to describe but almost like a duck filled Krispy Kreme donut, just incredible.\n\nService was excellent though I do feel they could of done a better job pacing the meal, almost felt rushed as the new dishes kept arriving.
1962	1	a	Let me start with WOW!  I've been here twice now and I would say this is by far the best place at SLS and for sure on the map for one of the best Mediterranean places in Vegas .  The watermelon feta salad is for sure a must have. I would describe as perfection at its best.  The Brussel sprout leafs amazing another must have.  Of course no meal is complete without a good drink. The Old Hollywood is a perfect mixed signature drink to complement your meal.  Also tried the lamb tartar which is on my favorites at Cleo as it melts in your mouth with all the flavor that leaves you wanting more .   I have had the pleasure of having the same server both times and it's horrible I can't remember his name. However I will get it and put it in here as he is awesome!   Good for groups or a date night this place will not disappoint!
1963	0	a	While the decor is inviting and the smells coming off the front grill station create an inviting atmosphere, the food and service do not measure up and were disappointing given the hype about Cleo. With only a couple of exceptions (we ordered over 25 items so we cannot be faulted for trying a good portion of the menu) the food was under cooked, served luke warm and devoid of any true flavor - certainly lacking in Mediterranean freshness and taste. Price points were reasonable. Would not return.
1964	1	a	This place is very good. Great. Just two very minor and easy to fix things: the music and the beer list. The music is way too loud and the beer list is too short. But the food, service, decor, and food (yes I said it twice). Is amazing.
1965	0	a	Waited almost an hour to get our food and then it was cold!!  Kitchen staff needs some organizational help.
1966	1	a	Loved the service., atmosphere and food! Brussels sprouts and clams with noodles were awesome! We loved it so much we want back the next night!
1967	0	a	CUSTOMER SERVICE = 1.5 out of 5.  \nFOOD and PRESENTATION = 5 out of 5\n\nI loved every item on their menu. For all the seafood lovers, the Scallops and Oysters are amazing. The Lamb is to die for. \n\nService however, is not up to par so please beware. First impressions are everlasting and this wasn't the impression i got from a service stand point. \n\nNegative: \n\nWas not impressed with the service at all. I had come with a large group on to celebrate my wife's birthday on Oct 17th. Our server started off amazing, but then totally spaced out on us. The worst thing was we never got a birthday cup cake or a group that came to sing for us despite giving a heads up to the staff. We saw other groups get more attention than ours. It was a special moment for my wife and it became totally not special. If we were not rushed to get to a show, I would have spoken to a manager. \n\nThe other thing that I was not too happy about was the plate breaking tradition. When I had asked, we got an answer from a manager or host stating that they only have a limit of 3 per night, which was hard to believe since we saw more than 3 people break plates ahead of us. \n\nBased on my experience, my service rating is a 1.5 out of 5. Vegas is synonymous with customer service in restaurants and for an establishment this large, I would expect more out of them. \n\n\nPositive: The food is amazing. If i were to rate them for food alone i would give this place a 5 out of 5. \n\nI would consider coming back to this place; however, my expectation for service would be a lot higher.
1968	0	a	Woowo I never taste such a bad food!\nHow can you take a Mediterranean food and make it so bad?!?! \nAnd the service is even worst. \nYou have to understand it's a tapas restaurant and the dishes are$11-$19 for a mini plates not even enough for one person!
1969	0	a	"I would love to give the hummus here 5 stars it's really that good! \n\nHowever the 2 times I've gone though really deserves 2 stars. I would give the food 4 stars. The service though is slacking big time!!!! \n\nThe first time I went the server was very awkward and talked wayyy too much. Even went on to say something about not ordering the flatbread because it has \""way too many carbs\"" under his breath. Hello I'm a normal 20 something girl, yes I like to watch my figure, but I freaking love carbs! Thank you! Ha! It also took 15 minutes to get both of my friends cocktails! This isn't even an exaggeration because a lot of the food we ordered was out by the time they got them. \n\nAs for my exact same cocktail that I ordered somehow got lost in translation. this place had barely anyone in it, I believe this was just the servers mistake at this point (no worries because everyone makes mistakes). \n\nWhat takes the cake though is he tried arguing with me how I never order one when all I did was ask politely where my cocktail was. Okay, so you didn't think I ordered one, but clearly I did, don't argue, just say sorry and go and reorder or order the cocktail I requested. \n\nThere were a few other incidents with this server, I forget his name, but did not really set the tone for finer dining. \n\nAfter that time I wanted to go back with my boyfriend because venues really do deserve a second chances. (Even third! Sometimes.) The second time was much much busier, after waiting 25 minutes past our reservation time we were sat at a small two top table in the front of the restaurant, wasn't exactly what we pictured, but weren't going to be picky because we just wanted a romantic night! \n\nSome commotion started happening with the tables next to us, they looked as though they were setting up for a big party. Then a someone came to inform us that a huge bachelorette party was being seated next to us and wanted to know if we would like to move. \n\nWe agreed that this was probably best, so we were moved to the chefs counter until another table was available. As the food we ordered at our old table started coming out to the new spot, everything seemed awkward at this point, and definitely a mood killer! We just wanted to be at an actual table eating and drinking the food we ordered!\n\nWe were finally sat our [final] table and they told us they were moving our food, which they did; but somehow took a bit, and by that time most of it was cold. We were very polite the whole time, but the night just wasn't going as we'd hoped. \n\nAfter the shuffle around the restaurant by multiple servers/ managers/ and hosts. We got the bill and (not saying that they have to) but not even a cocktail was taken care of for the inconvenience. Not that it was expected, but honestly it would have smoothed the experience over  for something as crazy as being moved 3 times in the middle of dinner.  \n\nIt was my boyfriends first time, and needless to say he isn't as forgiving as I am, and probably will not be back."
1970	1	a	Had reservations for 8pm on a Saturday night and we were seated promptly. Overall the place was 90% full. \n\nService - the entire staff was attentive and friendly. \n\nFood - it's all small plates / tapas family style here which works well. \n\nHummus with tahini with bread/veggies - hummus was tasty and not too paste-like. The bread was warm, soft, and fresh which went great with the hummus. The veggies were crisp and fresh. \n\nWagyu kebab - 50/50. Half of the meat was tender and soft while the other half was just too chewy. Flavor was good though. \n\nChicken kebab - it was good but the same as any chicken kebab I've had in the past. \n\nWatermelon and feta with avocado, spiced nuts, and cucumbers salad - probably our favorite of the night! Super flavorful and very refreshing. Couldn't get enough. \n\nMushrooms with dates, hazelnuts, puffed rice - if you like mushrooms then this is the dish for you. The puffed rice adds nice crunch. \n\nThe special - lamb shank cooked over 10 hours falling off the bone with pomegranate glaze served over bed of lentils.  - the meat was literally falling off the bone. Super tender and tasty. Fills you up as it is a heavy decadent dish. \n\nSticky toffee pudding - butterscotch, walnut feuilletine, vanilla gelato - nice way to end the meal. The middle was hot and soft which went well with the gelato on top. Not too sweet. Satisfying.
1971	1	a	I had been to the Cleo in Hollywood and heard that the one in Las Vegas had a different menu.  Some of the items are the same, some are new.  I'm not going to bore you with what I ate.  Just be sure if you go to get the Brussels sprouts. Nobody ever expects they could be so good.
1972	1	a	The Skinny: some well executed dishes with some mediocre ones makes this joint a (3.5). Service: our servers were okay but our busboy was freaking amazing! Best busboy ever! (5 stars for the busboy, 3 stars for the servers), value: although a bit on the pricey side for Mediterranean, some of the outstanding dishes are worth returning for (3.5 with a bump up to 4 starred review).\n\nWe came during the half priced locals deal on a Sunday. Overall as a Mediterranean high end joint, I was a little skeptical if it was going to be worth it.\n\nJust FYI, service is a bit confusing. We had two servers check in on us with regards to our table so we weren't really certain who we needed to talk to if we needed anything. In terms of explaining the menu, it wasn't immediately clear how many dishes we need to order as a tapas styled restaurant. So just so you know - 2.5-3 dishes/person depending if you order the mezze (smaller dishes) vs. a larger grilled dish. \n\nWe tried their hummus with laffa bread, spinach salad with figs, mushrooms with hazelnuts, lamb tagine with harissa, moussaka and duck bastilla.\n\nThey started us off with some great little puff pastries stuffed with cheese (I think it was feta). Piping hot, the cheese just oozed lusciously from the crisp layers. Really wonderful way to start a meal!\n\nHummus with laffa bread coated in za'taar was good. The hummus needs to be mixed a bit before digging in but the flavors were solid. The laffa bread came hot and mildly crispy in a bag on the table.\n\nSpinach salad - also quite nice. I didn't realize that it came with blue cheese (which didn't add anything to the dish) and would have preferred it without. Loved the combination of figs and vinegar dressing. \n\nMushrooms roasted with hazelnuts were the hands down best dish we had that night. The perfectly golden crust along the crunch of the hazelnuts were fabulous. If you love mushrooms, you will love this dish. It is possibly one of the best dishes I have had all year.\n\nLamb tagine with harissa: lamb was quite tender however it was a tad bland for me. Would have been nicer with a bit more ?preserved lemons to give it a bit more acidity. Overall, just an okay dish for me.\n\nAfter this set of dishes, there was lengthy wait about 15 minutes until the next dish. Unlike our server who promised multiple times that our dish was coming, our busboy pretty much made sure we got our dish while keeping our water glasses full and tending to a irate customer who was allergic to nuts who found nuts in her dish. I was impressed with our busboy. He did an excellent job and I wish he was our server instead.\n\nMoussaka: ugh! did not like this dish at all. First of all, the dish was served stone cold in the middle.  Second of all, there was too much nutmeg in this dish - making it taste really off and odd. Never had moussaka like this before. We had to send it back.\n\nDuck Bastilla: this dish was meh and not up to my expectations. In my opinion, the filling was a too wet for me and spiced correctly (needed a lot more cinnamon). The lack of nuts was also very surprising. I would skip this dish.\n\nWe finished off with the almond pannacotta with figs. It was okay - the texture was a bit too solid and not quite silky smooth enough. Flavor wise, it was rather uninteresting. I would probably skip this next time.\n\nOverall, given the stellar dishes we received, this joint is worth another look. The service we received by our busboy was phenomenal however the servers were sort of lackluster although they did take off the horrible moussaka after we sent it back. 3.5 starred review with a bump up to 4.
1973	0	a	"This restaurant had the most laughably bad service I had experienced in Vegas.  \nHere is the setup:\n* large group (10 of us), all local, all foodies, all hungry, but all in a good mood.  \n* great environment, table, music.\n\nHere are the problems, in chronological order:\n* 1/2 empty restaurants should never take that long to seat someone with a reservation.  6-7 minutes.  and 1/2 empty is generous.\n\n* Look, I lived in Spain for a while so I understand Tapas culture.  But menu items showed up so randomly and so far apart that you would almost assume they forgot about us or served other people our food.\n\n* They brought us 3 dishes we did not order.  Then they re-brought us the same dish (the 1st of the 3) 5 minutes later as if to say \""going twice......\""  Is this an auction?\n\n* The silverware was cleared, in preparation for what we thought was coffee and dessert time.  Instead, they brought out more of our food.  Coordination / chaos.\n\n* The server then asked if we wanted to keep the food out there, and we asked them if they noticed the missing silverware.  So they were a bit matter-of-fact and humorless as if this is normal course-of-business.  \""OK, do you want me to bring silverware back so you can finish your last 2-3 courses?\""\n\n* After turning down the final plates post-silverware clearing, we were presented with dessert menus and set up with dessert plates and coffee cups.  We each ordered dessert.  Then the manager came by 5 minutes AFTER ordering and said \""we are sorry, the kitchen is closed. We didn't know you would be staying so long.\""\n\n\nSome restaurants deserve a second chance.  I used to work in the service industry, and I know that sometimes you can't do anything right.  This was just one of those nights for them. But it was a complete disaster - and it was specifically MISMANAGED / POORLY COORDINATED.  The place has promise, but would need a new GM and waitstaff that care."
1974	1	a	Mediterranean tapas galore.  Of the many dishes we tried, the scallops & the clams and noodles were my favorite.  The out of restaurant restroom (in the nearby casino) was a little inconvenient but the overall mood of restaurant romantic and cozy...as long as you don't get seated near the entrance which borders some slot machines and gaming tables.
1975	1	a	Cleo is an outstanding restaurant in the trendy, sophisticated SLS hotel. I received a $40 food credit and thought, why not check this place out? Firstly, the ambiance here is so adorable. From the chandeliers to the silverware, everything in this restaurant gave me a warm Aladdin-esque feel. We were seated in a little private section with drapes all around to give it an essence of seclusion.\n\nWe were a group of 5 girls and stuck to the mezzes. We had to order two rounds of the grilled octopus topped with fennel with a garlic cream sauce.. it was outstanding! Just enough of a smokey taste but it was still soft inside. We also ordered two plates of the brussel sprouts. They were a bit on the oily side but I loved how they were decomposed and shaved, which gave it more of a crunch and flakiness after they were baked/fried. We had the falafel, beet salad, lamb and chicken kebab, hummus, chicken liver, and the Turkish salad. We loved every bite of every plate.\n\nKeep in mind, the plates are small and they are all family style. They bring the food as its made, so they come out individually.\n\nFor dessert, we had the sticky toffee pudding with Turkish coffee. The coffee is made with sugar, which would have been nice to have known prior to ordering. Regardless, it was a decent shot of coffee. The toffee pudding was good but not memorable.\n\nThe service was quick and friendly. All of the waiters had a smile on their face and were eager to fill our glasses with water. I am glad I tried this restaurant and am looking forward to trying their other location in Los Angeles!
1976	1	a	This is essentially a high end Mediterranean tapas restaurant. Small portions, Strip prices (most dishes range from $7-$16). I was a little skeptical about it, but I will say that everything was very delicious and well done. Our server was a tad bit too casual for my taste (I have a bit of an issue when servers sit down next to me to take my order), but she was very personable, friendly, and checked on us often.\n\nThe decor was very sexy, and would be perfect for a date night. Just dim enough to feel romantic, and very sophisticated. \n\nWe ordered: Garlic Shrimp, Grilled Octopus, Hanger Steak, and a lamb dish whose name escapes me. They were all delicious and perfectly cooked. Our cocktails ($14) were also delicious. Now, 4 dishes between 2 people totaled just under $100, which did sting a little bit.. You're not going to be full, especially if you go and you're very hungry. But if you're not starving, you'll be pretty satisfied.  A solid choice.
1977	1	a	When we went, there were only about 90 reviews on Yelp. I asked the hostess and I guess they had only opened two months prior. Their biggest problem, as expertly noticed by my ex-waiter fiance, was the inxperienced system. The hostess was running around doing some of duties that I think runners typically have. Once we were sat, we were ignored for a while. I don't blame them. They were far too busy and there were far too few servers... but it was 7pm and in Vegas, attention to detail is everything.\n\n-1 star\n\nThe food, however, was largely delicious! Get the kale bread. We expected something bitter, but the creme fraiche made it sweet and savory. It might be the best thing we had that night. We also loved the falafel, but be warned: they are bite-sized. The hummus was great. I was looking forward to the babaganoush but it tasted plain. Nothing to write home about~more cheese than eggplant.\n\nDefinitely go, but at not at peak hours until they get into the groove of things.
1978	1	a	Mesculin salad and Hawaiian pizza ala Napolitaine style...very tasty! Quick service,  quality Ingredients friendly atmosphere.
1979	0	a	"Tasteless pizza. My friend and I went randomly maybe three weeks ago, and they had no idea what they were doing. Ordered my pizza and customized it, the chef looked at me like I was crazy. Payed for the pizza ended up being more expensive than ordering in and more than one box of pizza. Ready to pay and the cashier couldn't \""print my bill\"". Yes the pizza is freshly made, the toppings-they need to add more-extremely stingy with them actually. We were sitting next to another group of ppl and one of them was complaining about the same thing I have. Tasteless tasteless pizza. I get they are trying to be authentic, put please add some flavor to your tomato sauce sheesh."
1980	0	a	We had eaten there two times so far, the food is great... The Hostess was good, very nice, the waiter, Edgar,  different story, he made us feel like we were bothering him for coming in, he was bothered when my 9 year old son wanted corn dogs, that wasn't on the menu, but he just asked, he Edgar just stood there with an awkward silence,  and made a comment in spanish, with The word Gringo in the comment. He also refilled my drink with out asking me and ignored the fact that my wife's glass was empty. .. what a shame this place had great food but piss poor service.
1981	0	a	Ok so I super excited to have a new Mexican resturant in the area and boy was I disappointed with this one. This is not good Mexican food and you can tell that wait staff had no idea what they were doing, they all seemed confused including the management. Their salsa had no flavor and was just watered down, I wont even talk about the horrible margarita I had. I wont be going back I was truly not impressed.
1982	1	a	Food: Great family size portions, always hot, bold flavors. The chips and salsa are okay. Not the best I've had, certainly not the worst. It's nice that they offer a couple different types of salsa if you ask depending on your spice preference. \nWe've had beef, chicken, seafood, pork, soup, and salads. All delicious. Especially impressed with the soups. Tortilla was our favorite. Very deep, rich flavored broth. All meats have been tender and clearly slow cooked. \n\nService: Friendly, quick, consistent. They've always checked back on us to make sure we're happy with the food. \n\nAmbience: Colorful, tastefully done, and festive. \n\nAs usual with Yelp, some of these reviews are laughable. Trying to order corn dogs at a Mexican food restaurant, being upset about having your drink refilled, upset that your plate was hot?!    Hopefully these guests can return to their preferred Mexican food restaurant, Taco Bell, which seems to be more in line with their level of dining maturity. \nMy wife and I have been here nearly every week since opening. There were some service bugs that were worked out after the first week but this certainly is to be expected with most restaurant openings. \n\nGlad this family owned restaurant took a chance on Maricopa. Will be back again for sure.
1983	0	a	I'm not sure where to start. I guess I had my hopes up because there are few good places to sit down and enjoy a meal here in Maricopa. \n   We went during their soft open, they are now officially open. But I haven't heard anything positive about this place from any of our friends since their opening.\n   The chips were bland and their salsa was little more than tomato sauce with a couple of chunks of onion. I ordered the Tres Amigos which had chile rellano, chile verde, and chile Colorado. The pork was tough, but the verde sauce was nice. The chile Colorado was bland and even though the beef was tender, it lacked flavor. The chile rellano was ok. I did feel that the breading was too thick, but thankfully the cheese was tasty.  The refried beans reminded me of baby food. Pureed beans thinned with a bit of water. The rice was mediocre at best. My husband ordered the chicken enchiladas. He was unimpressed. \n   Our server was prompt, but I seriously think he was high. Cocaine is a hell of a drug I hear. He didn't speak any English, which made ordering a pain. He also made us feel like we were being an inconvenience any time we asked for a refill.\n  The wall decor is fun, though the elk head leftover from when the space was Teakwood's was a bit odd. :)
1984	0	a	My wife and I were excited to see an new restaurant pop up where the old Teakwoods once was and were hopeful that it would really be a competitor to Penascos.  My overall review of Plaza Bonita is that it is painfully average and incredibly underwhelming.  This is nothing more than an standard run of the mill Mexican restaurant. That would not be a bad thing if they really nailed the food; which they didn't.\n\nThe first thing I noticed was that the chips and salsa that came out were sub par.  The chips were very thick and oily and the Salsa was completely liquid, no chunk of any kind save a few pieces of onion floating inside.  Mind you this was supposed to be garden salsa, which should be very chunky, not a chipotle that one would expect to be without chunk.  \n\nI ordered the Enchiladas Deluxe and when I asked if they could put Carne Asada inside instead of shredded beef.  I was told they had no Carne Asada, so I went with chicken...   Good thing I didn't go with my initial thought which was Carne Asada tacos.  When the plate arrived immediately I noticed that the refried beans were like puree so they were runny and I am fairly sure they were out of a can.  The rice was bland and again tasted like something seasoned with a pre-packaged seasoning mix.  The enchiladas were... enchiladas... but the tortillas were thick and spongy so they also didn't earn high marks.  \n\nEveryone else I was with had about the same impression with their meals.  The food wasn't terrible but it was just something you can get at any Mexican restaurant, both sit down and drive thru, and was not executed well.  I can go anywhere and get Mexican food so why would I choose to spend money at just another Mexican restaurant when I can choose Penascos, On the Border, Macayos, Blue Adobe Grill, etc?  All said in hindsight I would have rather taken my money to Federicos and spent about 1/5 the price... Hell at least at Federicos I know they are going to have Carne Asada.
1985	0	a	Food was ok. Service was horrible. Waiter was extremely rude and never refilled our drinks even when we asked. The furniture was very outdated and looked dirty. We had high hopes that we might have a decent restaurant in Maricopa, but no such luck.
1986	1	a	The food has been great every visit. Had the same server, Edgar, all three times so far, he's got the perfect level of attentiveness, not to clingy or distant.
1987	1	a	Food has been great overall and no complaints about the service.  We've ordered a variety of different items from the menu each time we go and have never been disappointed. We'll be going on a regular basis.
1988	1	a	Food was good and the service was as well. Happy to finally have a decent sit down Mexican food place in town!
1989	1	a	"I stopped in earlier this evening to \""check it out\"" because I am interested in joining. What a huge change from the Harkins theater that used to be here! I love the massage chairs and would opt for the $19.99/ month membership just to be able to use them. \n\nWhat I don't like, however is that I found the gym too warm for my \""hot\"" self. There are two large ceiling fans, but I found several areas without any air flow. I'm used to personal fans on the cardio machines. The cardio machines don't have personal tvs either, something else I'm used to.\n\nI might go as someone's guest to workout before I make my final decision."
1990	0	a	Hostess is not friendly at all. I counted 6 open table (and that's just what I could see) and she told me it was a 5-10 minute wait. A couple came after me and the hostess didn't even acknowledge them. While waiting for my food, I saw five tables hunt down servers to get their bill. My biggest pet peeve is when glasses aren't refilled and my husbands ran bone dry. No one filled it. We were going to have dessert but went somewhere else. The wait was too long and they were not busy at all.
1991	0	a	Started with the unfriendly hostesses that didn't even acknowledge us. Open tables but told us to wait 15-20 mins.   Waitress was also unfriendly with no urgency.  We wait FOREVER for everything and the food was not even good!  Everyones food  came out cold-warm like it was sitting for a while.
1992	1	a	Read the other reviews but wanted to tried out this place anyway. Whatever happened to the other reviewers did NOT happen to my girlfriend and I. Nice little cafe. Dani the server was really nice and refilled our drinks. Food was good, comparable to a dennys. Overall nice little place.
1993	0	a	Poor service, poor food! Ordered the steak and potato soup which was horrible. Sent it back. Didn't order anything else because it took too long to get the original order. We will never be back!
1994	0	a	Very slow service. We waited 30 mins for our food and it was only my friend and I at our table. Our food was delivered to the table next to us. I had the chicken and waffles and it was just ok. My friend had an omelet and they put a slice of Kraft cheese on top. Weird. I wouldn't go back.
1995	0	a	"S+O is a little restaurant in the Downtown Grand hotel and casino. My family & I we're tantalized by the pictures of their food posted in the elevators, & the convenience of it being located in the casino, so we thought we'd try this place out. \n\nWe came here for dinner, & due to a major hangover I ordered the Roasted Chicken (less grease, less chance of worsening this hangover). Our food came rather quickly considering there was only ONE waiter for the entire restaurant.. But! They fell short on food quality. My chicken was not cooked thoroughly, and was still veryy pink/red on the inside. And there was even some blood on my mashed potatoes from the uncooked chicken. If I thought that was bad; My broccoli florets still had the rubber and around it, and I almost ate it! This also signified to me that they did not clean my broccoli well, and this was bad for business. On a much lighter note, I did let our waiter know, & they did take it off the bill, as well as sent over someone to apologize to us for the chicken dish. Phew! I was just glad to get that off the bill, because there was no way I was going to pay for that few bites of chicken that I had and NOT complain. Kudos to them for making it that much easier on them and myself. \n\nMy mother ordered their salmon dish, & the salmon was still kind of raw. How raw? It left the rice extremely moist! It was edible, but not very good. My Dad and sister barely ate their food, & just took it in boxes to go.\n\nThe second time that I came here it was for breakfast. It was just me and my Mom. I ordered the cinnamon bun waffles, and my mother ordered the apple raisin oatmeal. Our entire wait time was almost 45 minutes! This included 15 minutes for her to take our order after being seated, 25 minutes to get our food out, and 5 minutes to eat it.\n\nOn the menu the Cinnamon bun waffles are supposed to be \""one of the best\"", and it was farrrrr from that! For one thing it was BURNT, and very hard to eat. Secondly, the frosting was stuck to my plate like glue, and was very unappetizing. Third, the dough tasted a lot like the Pillsbury crescent roll packaged dough.. Veryyyy un-cinnabon like:/ Very disappointing! My mother's oatmeal was as basic as it could get, and her reaction was, \""It's just.. Alright.\""\n\nNice servers, but horrible food."
1996	0	a	"Unfortunate experience. Staying at the hotel. Beautiful rooms, outstanding service. This restaurant however, very disappointing. Firstly, I asked for a cappuccino. They got me a regular coffee with extra foam that was barely room temperature. When I told them it was cold, they took it back and got it back to me in 30 seconds, in the same cup. Made me wonder how they heated it up so fast! Not what you'd expect from a hotel of this calibre. Not only was it a very dilute poor tasting coffee, but it had granules of coffee powder at the bottom. A cappuccino isn't rocket science! \nSecond, I ordered some food to go. They took over 25 minutes to get it. I can't complain about that. The place was busy. However, the waiter insisted on coming by every few minutes saying it would be two minutes longer. He did this 5-6 times. When I got upset, he said it would take 10 minutes longer, and replied stating this was \""America\"", it's ok to wait!\nVery poor service. In spite of this, I left a tip which wasn't deserved. They need to get their act together."
1997	1	a	Fresh and many choices! Cooked and made to your liking. Overall it's pretty good. Still doesn't compare to Spinato's or Oregano's. Would come again if the wife was out of town, quick and easy
1998	1	a	The staff was nice n friendly. Pizza was good. Need a few more cheese options but they had pasta as well. I will come back for a good pizza with a friendly staff. Location does not have much foot traffic. Overall it was a good pizza with a friendly staff.
1999	0	a	The Jeff Spicoli lookalike behind the counter informed us that pizza five 85 is set up a lot like chipotle for Italian food. The idea is brilliant and they let you choose between a pizza, pasta or salad. You then get to pick all of the ingredients chipotle style. The ingredients range from meatballs, chicken, sausage, and a whole selection of vegetables. This all sounds awesome until you take a bite. \n\nThis is by far the worst pizza and pasta I have ever tasted in my life, including the stuff I make at home and I'm a crappy cook. The marinara used for the pizza and pasta is laughable. It has this disgusting sweet taste to it that tastes like something you would expect from a Peter Piper Pizza or Chuck E Cheese. The pizza dough is pretty much a tortilla, that's how thin it is. When baked, it tastes like a nacho chip with pizza toppings on it.\n\nWe ordered the bow tie pasta and it was soggy and overcooked. How do you mess up pasta at an Italian place??? I can't believe how bad this place is. If the word Pizza is in the name of your eating establishment, your pizza better be good. I will never return to this place. Such a shame! It has such a brilliant concept. Too bad the execution is so awful.
2000	0	a	We decided to stop in for a late lunch. We were super excited because we love the competitor, Fired Pie a few miles away, also in Chandler. We were greeted right away which was nice. The space is very modern and cool looking. On the walls were TVs that showed Yelp, Facebook and Twitter feeds. Hint: Go right immediately in the door. It is open to guessing so if you go straight you are actually at the register, not the ordering area. It is tough to tell where to start when you walk in. We ordered a salad and pizza. We were asked if it was for here or to go. I said here. The salad then came from a cooler below the items you pick from -  in a to go container. If the salad is in a premade to go container, why does it matter where we ate it??  This should have been my first clue. We asked for regular sauce on our pizza and they kept insisting we put olive oil on it so it wouldn't burn. I said no to which the gal said, you can't taste the olive oil, it's just there. If you don't put it on it will burn. This should have been my second clue. I said no, I didn't want it.  I picked the toppings to my salad and we did the same for the pizza. The salad was ok but the chicken on the salad was extremely tough to chew. The pizza was ok but a little doughy in the middle. As we sat eating I watched a man clean the stainless steel with a chemical in a metal container and a rag. All above where the pizza gets cut . After another crowd of people came through I watched a second gentleman clean the stainless steel on the front of the oven doing the same. As we were leaving there was a man standing in the doorway to the back of the kitchen tucking his shirt into his pants. Food was meh at best. A couple employees were super nice and helpful while some appeared to be on their first day on the job, not so helpful and knew very little about anything. I asked what the Five85 stood for since the prices are $7.95 ( if I remember correctly). She said she didn't really know but it was probably just a name they made up. She didn't seem to know much about the company she worked for and had a very difficult time ringing us up. Can't say I would recommend this place or go back. Sadly, we were so excited too. Bummer.
2001	0	a	"First and foremost they suck and I believe them to be bait and switch artist!!! \n\nI was going to go to Chipotle next-door for dinner but the line was long (because it is good). The hawker on the side walk convinced me this was a Italian equivalent to Chipotle and they were running a special for $5.85 that was normally $7.75. DONE I'm in! \n\nFirst your sign is confusing as hell there were 5 people standing there trying to figure it out. It had more words than a Twitter post and this review. But it should have had 8; \""pizza one size any sauce any topping $7.75\"".\n\nI built my pizza and headed to the cashier were the girl from our side was now on register. \n\n\""$10.53 please\"", she said. \n\n\""You just told me it was $5.85. How expensive is the drink?\""\n\n\""Do you have the coupon\"", she asked?\n\n\""You didn't tell me I needed the coupon\""\n \n\""Well you do\"", she said. \n\nAt this point the manager slowly faded into the background. Eventually hiding in the back room.\n\nSo I'll never be back again!!!!\n\nP.S. If I was Chipotle I would sue these idiots for trade infringement and libel!!!"
2002	0	a	The pizza is Peter Piper quality. If you like good pizza learn from my mistake. Skip this place.\n\nThe sauce is nasty. They put too much on and it kills any potential for a decent bite.\n\nThe veggies are average and the meats are OK--glad they have chicken as an option.\n\nNo matter what you put on it, the sauce overpowers the pizza as a whole.\n\nMuch better pizza over at Jimmy and Joes for lunch. Dinner? Grab Grimaldis.
2003	0	a	"Glad I came here... Only because I know it's not that good enough to come back. The notion of a \""chipotle-of-pizza-AND-pasta\"" was exciting but unfortunately, expectations weren't met. \n\nThe pasta was probably only okay because we were REALLY hungry. It was quite bland and the bits of Cajun chicken they have are dry. I will say the pizza isn't half bad. I liked the BBQ sauce, it was nice a tangy. The pizza was crispy, not soggy. But there are just much better create-your-pizza places out there. \n\nAnother word of advice when coming here: do not go here if you are in a hurry. My bf and I had a show to attend and were looking for something quick. Seeing that there was no line when we entered, we thought this would be fast but it seemed like the employee was working in snail mode. The pizza takes about 10+ minutes to cook as well. \n\nThe 2 stars I gave were for the smiles and kindness of the employees. I appreciated it."
2004	0	a	"Just stopped here (6:30 PM on a Saturday evening), and was surprised to see they're closed! Yelp says it's \""open\"", and their web site says they close at 9 PM today. No sign was in the window to explain, so I don't know if the closure is temporary or not.\n\nUpdate: mid-afternoon on Sunday, and this place is still closed. Doesn't look good."
2005	1	a	My favorite Hawaiian BBQ spot in town. When I go I always get the BBQ Chicken plate and my girlfriend gets the kalua pork plate. Both come with rice and macaroni salad. We also like to get the punch drinks. The great thing about this spot is its very fast service....And they also deliver! So now we can stay at home and order lol. I recommend this to anyone who wants to try some good Hawaiian BBQ! The Best! Dine in area kinda small.\n\n-Joe
2006	1	a	"Prior to dining, my only familiarity with the Katsuya name was from TMZ.  If I were making half a milly per TV episode, this would be in my regular dining rotation too!  The menu's prices are on par with Nobu, Sushi Roku or Blue Ribbon.  \n\nAt least those restaurants offer some kind of a chic atmosphere.  Katsuya felt like an upscale diner with a sushi bar plunked in the middle.  The bright lighting, noise from the casino and the constant yelling of \""Irashaimase!\"" over and over and over by employees made this a decisively unsexy spot.  I can't imagine tourists would want this kind of setting for a pricey sushi meal on the strip.  If a booth at Nobu's outpost at Caesars Palace is Kate Upton, it's kind of Rosie O'Donnell here.  Power lunches or corporate dinners? Yes.  Anniversary dinners or bachelorette parties? No!  \n\nFor those reasons, my wife and I chose to sit at the bar since the people working there looked like they were having a good time.  All them were super nice and knowledgeable of all things Katsuya. They also made some awesome cocktails to boot.  I loved the \""Sahara Cooler\"" which consisted of Ketel One Oranje vodka, Aperol, passion-fruit pur\u00e9e, fresh lime juice, and Stiegl Radler Grapefruit beer.  That was instant refreshment.  One of the bartenders, whose name escapes me but I remember being a Chargers/Eagles fan, created a wonderful version of a prickly pear cocktail for my wife. \n\nThe plan was to not order items we could get at local, off the strip Japanese spots like Kyara or Raku.  So $8 edamame (shockingly saw lots of people order this), anything from the robata grill ($12 for asparagus with no bacon) and $11 karaage were out of the question.  \n\nWant to know what was?  Rare Wagyu filet with foie gras on top!  So tender and soooo decadent, it was like a story I never wanted to end.  The plum wine sauce reduction really added a nice balance.  Lobster and truffle chawanmushi was another dish I don't see everyday.  Despite the small portion being steamed in a Japanese tea cup, I thought it tasted great and would probably order it again.  Dig in from the bottom for maximum truffle taste.\n\nI thought the Wagyu sashimi seared with hot oil and topped with chives and ginger was very good too.  The oil they used made it taste more like a Chinese dish which was a nice little changeup from the other beef dish.  Seared tuna with Japanese salsa was equally as good.  The high quality of the fish was easy to see as well as taste.\n\nMy wife was still hungry and had her eye on the \""Wafu Carbonara\"" which was simply described as \""slow-cooked bacon, soy reduction, and soft poached egg\"".  I tried to talk her out of it since she makes a great version of this dish at home.  Unsurprisingly, I lost that battle.  One of the bartenders assured us this was something worth having and she was right.  The huge chunks of pork belly with bonito flakes and sauce/egg mix just oozing over the ramen noodles was a hearty dish and a nice ending to the meal."
2007	0	a	Great fish. Everything else pretty much a disaster. Service juvenile. Hours for follow up on simple asks. Ran out of unfiltered saki at 7:30pm. Give them a year to pull it together.
2008	1	a	"So tonight, I rolled up to the hostess, and said \""worlds smallest birthday party for one please\"". \nI was given birthday wishes by every member of the staff, including the head chef of all of katsuya who came to my table and called me by my name because he remembered me from the last time I was there.\nThe SLS Hotel gives you a $30 dining credit for your birthday, which is also nice, so I loaded up on wagyu beef. So melt in your mouth delicious. I had red snapper sushi with yuzu/pepper , wagyu sashimi, wagyu sushi, creamy spicy rock shrimp tempura on a spicy tuna roll and the Fairbanks roll.  I was sooooo full, but thank god for my separate desert stomach, because my strawberry birthday mochi was the best I ever had. I'm not a fan of it normally,, but now I will always order it from here.\nThanks for my genuine birthday love, amazing food and great service, Katsuya!"
2009	0	a	We decided to give them a try for dessert before trying them for dinner. The server told us there was not a dessert menu but they had yuzu cheesecake, green tea creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e, chocolate lava cake, and yuzu sorbet. None of the desserts seemed inspired to me. Especially the chocolate lava cake which is outdated and the green tea creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e which is commonly served at Japanese restaurants. \n\nNone of the desserts were well executed. Instead of coming with yuzu cheesecake, the dessert sampler came with black sesame mochi because they ran out of the cheesecake. \n\nI am in no rush to return for dinner because if they cannot execute straight forward desserts I do not feel they can execute straight forward Japanese food.
2010	1	a	Excellent service! I wish I remembered our server's name - She was WONDERFUL!! The food was great too, but the only reason I dinged down one star is because they overcharged my friend's credit card when they adjusted the tip... other than that - it was great!
2011	0	a	Katsu-bla....what makes the LA version good is the scene...when you take the scene away and expose the mediocre food and double the price, it makes for a disappointing experience.  I have to say the service is great...but the food was just not good...nothing was balanced or seasoned correctly and the fish was below average. Dropped $380 on 2 people so we sample quite a lot...but not nearly as much as you would expect for that price and a thoroughly disappointing meal.
2012	1	a	Wowie Wow Wow.  The Very Best black Cod that I have ever tasted. It was like eating butterfish & the portion size was VERY generous. The wagyu beef was so tasty & tender. The Sushi platter was very colorful & the ginger was primo quality! \nServers are so helpful, happily checking in, making suggestions, & inciting our party to return soon.  The sweets are so fresh & tasty.  This restaurant is such a bonus for the SLS casino. It makes the casino definitely worth going to!
2013	0	a	Expensive , small small amount too much modern style I'm not recommend here at all at all. I stop eat in hotel restaurants I should have stay that!! Just waste money
2014	1	a	Great selections! Sushi great, but the meat selections were fantastic.
2015	1	a	Amazing restaurant in the SLS. Loved the crispy rice spicy tuna and the baked lobster roll. Sushi chef was great and service was good.
2016	1	a	I was afraid I'd over inflated my expectations for this place, but I'm pleased to say that they were met, and then some!  \n\nFirst off, the atmosphere is hip and chill. If you are dressed too casually,  you will definitely be the odd one out, but it is not a stuffy scene in the least. The floor plan gives you a wide-angle view of the casino floor. You never forget you're on the Strip, but in the best possible way.\n\nOur server, Mario, was A++. \n\nNow, for the food.... we started off with the crispy rice and spice tuna. it was the perfect 10 in texture and flavor. That will easily be a go-to the next time I'm here.\n\nI had the crispy chicken salad, the California roll, and, the belle of the tasting ball, the Special Katsuya Roll. The flavors were clean, fresh, and delectable. \n\nFor dessert, we shared the green tea mochi. Yummy! \n\nGlad we came! I'll definitely be back!
2017	1	a	Went here last night for sushi. Overall I would recommend. Had the Katsuya special roll, light, crisp, great way to start. Then had the double Hamachi and Tiger roll (liquid gold!) - highly recommend all those. The disappointment was the lobster roll - too rich and mushy lobster. I would come here again but would skip the lobster.
2018	1	a	"We dined here a couple weeks ago for their #SocialSundays promotion for locals (50% off your bill). There were a couple items that were excluded from the promotion: Omakase Geta, Otoro, Chutoro, and A4 Sukiyaki. I was disappointed since I wanted to order the Omakase Geta, but that didn't stop me.\n\nWe were sat next to the sushi bar, so I had a wonderful time watching the sushi chefs expertly craft their beautiful dishes. It was very busy that evening and service was just okay. We were constantly wondering where our server was and our beverages remained empty on a couple occasions.\n\nNaturally, I had high expectations because of the stature of Katsuya and the prices to match. However, I was also anticipating it to be all \""hype,\"" but I was pleasantly delighted with our meal. Besides some of the typical flavors you could find at any sushi joint in town, there were great surprises. Overall, the food is delicious and although the high prices may be a deterrent, there are several dishes that I would love to eat again.\n\nKatsuya Ceviche ($18): Assorted sashimi, avocado, red onion, radish, cilantro, edible flowers, yuzu and lime dressing, and served with shrimp chips. This was wonderful. It was fresh like you'd expect from a ceviche and the dressing was fantastic!\n\nSalmon Sashimi with Caviar ($25): Salmon sashimi is rolled around a Japanese onion chutney, topped with caviar, and served on a cucumber crisp. The chutney turned a simple dish into something a little more special. I could have done without the cucumber though; it didn't add anything to the experience.\n\nWagyu Sashimi ($18): The thinly-sliced wagyu is topped with hot oil, young garlic, and chives. The wagyu was fantastic and the oil/sauce was flavorful.\n\nWagyu Filet with Foie Gras ($39): Filets of perfectly cooked Wagyu with equal-sized medallions of foie gras, topped with a plum wine reduction. This dish was fantastic. The Wagyu was so, so tender and it was just euphoric with the custard-y foie.\n\nMushroom Bop ($18): It's a take on Korean Dolsot Bibimbap with a hot pot filled with rice, spinach, and miscellaneous fungi like Truffle, Procini, Enoki, and Shiitake. Now, this is a dish I would never have ordered and I was so pleased with it! The flavors were incredible.\n\nOmakase Geta ($150): Lobster and Truffle Chawanmushi, Tako with Cucumber Sunomono, Special Katsuya Roll, Sahara Roll, Baked Crab Hand Roll, Crispy Rice with Spicy Tuna, Negi Toro Roll, Assorted Nigiri (Ikura, Uni, Chutoro with Caviar, and Kanpachi), and Assorted Sashimi (Amaebi, Scallop, Otoro, Japanese Red Snapper, Aji, Bluefin Tuna, and Salmon). First, would I recommend ordering the Omakase Geta? Ehh, yes and no. It's a gorgeous, tasty masterpiece that is impossible to capture in one photograph, however, the items offered are rather boring. The exception being the Lobster and Truffle Chawanmushi (I recommend ordering a couple of these to start your meal). Everything else was delicious, but nothing I haven't had at other sushi restaurants (I would pass on the Sahara Roll as it tasted exactly like rolls found at AYCE sushi places). Oh, the Baked Crab Hand Roll was a surprise. I didn't think it was going to be much, but it was great!\n\nDessert Omakase ($8): Green Tea Mochi Ice Cream, Lychee Sorbet, Chocolate Cake, Yuzu Cheesecake, and Matcha Green Tea Creme Br\u00fbl\u00e9e. I really enjoyed the Yuzu Cheesecake (although it was MUCH too small even to share), Lychee Sorbet, and Chocolate Cake."
2019	1	a	"A \""Japanese\"" chain restaurant in cities Brentwood, Dubai, Glendale, Hollywood, Kuwait, LA, Las Vegas and South Beach; an NO location in Japan.  It speaks volumes.\n\nSarcasm aside, and putting it mildly, this is yet another restaurant designed for the gaijin serving faux Japanese fare like silly 15 ingredient sushi creations with even more ridiculous names like a tiger roll or corn crunch roll.  That said, it does a better job than most.\n\nModern interior, clean lines, and a contemporary vibe provide a great setting for the culinary creations.  \n\nIn general, fresh seafood, beautiful, colorful plantings and wonderful presentation that heighten the experience and mask imperfections.\n\nCreative dishes are very good.  A lobster and truffle chawanmushi with its soft, velvety texture, hints of dashi and sweet lobster accented by the earthy finish of truffle is good eats.  The scallop sashimi outstanding.  Brightened by the yuzu, perfect texture with apple and peppery finish of watercress.  The wagyu sashimi, gently seared with oil perfectly accented by the heat and pounced flavor of ginger and bitterness of chives.\n\nNice selection of wagyu beef dishes including some using A4 Japanese wagyu.  Be careful of the fatty richness.  It's very easy to fill up.  The wagu short rib, rib eye, and skirt steak from the robata grill are a great way to try different cuts and flavors.  The wagyu filet with foie and a plum wine reduction also worthy albeit excessively rich as the plum reduction lacks sufficient acidity to cut through the fat on fat pairing of the wagyu and foie.  Sadly the A4 wagyu rice was excessively oily with a cloying mouth feel paling in comparison to that of BarMASA.\n\nForget the silly rolls, they are a waste of the very good quality, fresh seafood.  Additionally, the rice for the nigiri is aggressively seasoned, sticky, and compacted with broken grains.  The seasoning takes away from the enjoyment.  Focus on sashimi offerings (ask for any sushi offering as sashimi).  Correctly graded chu and o-toro, very good mirugai, aji, and uni.\n\nWell chosen selection of beer  and very well chosen selection of sake at Vegas resort markup.   \n\nGood service but still showing the \""green\"" uncertainty that will go away with time.\n\nDefinitely one of the better \""interpretive\"" Japanese eateries in Vegas today."
2020	0	a	I can appreciate what they are 'trying' to do but this place is not an AUTHENTIC Japanese restaurant. From the interior design down to the food. I wouldn't say the food is terrible but for the price you are paying, it definitely isn't great. I'm a sushi connoisseur so I know when sushi/sashimi is good when I look at it. When our sushi came out, the salmon and unagi (eel) looked as if it was exposed to air for a very long time. The only reason why we came here is because we were provided with credit by SLS (Hotel). For the people that occasionally eat Japanese good, this may be a good place but if you are looking for an AUTHENTIC Japanese dining experience, then I would look else where. If you love sashimi/sushi then I would try Yellow Tail at the Bellagio. Now if you have deep pockets then I would make the trip to Urasawa. \n\nI only gave it two stars because the service was good and our female server was good looking.
2021	1	a	We went to Katsuya on our stay-cation to celebrate Eric R.'s birthday.  It happened to be the 50% off locals Sunday pick.  We did not have reservations so we opted to sit at the cocktail bar.  Our bartender/server happened to recognize me from a past job in town and that made it a very personable experience.  We got there right at opening (6 PM) and ordered immediately.  I had iced green tea (apparently the SLS commissions its own tea plantation for exclusive hot and iced teas) and Eric R. had hot green tea and the Katsuya fresh cucumber cocktail.\n\nSome things we ordered we waited over an hour for, and things our neighbor at the bar got we were told the kitchen ran out of even though we ordered them at the same time (like negi toro) so that was frustrating.  We tried a variety of dishes, including the seaweed sunomono, salmon sashimi appetizer with caviar, and the wagyu beef sashimi with hot oil (Nobu's was better).  We sampled yellowtail, salmon, toro, scallop, and mackerel sushi.  The mackerel was served with thin kelp on top of it.\n\nI also tried a salmon skin handroll which had kaiware sprouts, gobo, and cucumber.  One of my favorite dishes of the night was the mushroom bop - a hot stone pot like dolsot bimibap with arborio rice, a variety of mushrooms, a hint of parmesan, and a sauce that brought it all together so deliciously.  We finished with the dessert omakase which had mochi, yuzu cheesecake, green tea creme brulee, and sorbet.  Service was great though we had a rush of food then a very long wait for the rest of the stuff.  With the half off and a few comps for the wait plus the $5 happy hour cocktails, we ended up right below our dining credit allotment so all we paid was tax and tip - sweet local deal and a great birthday present for Eric R.
2022	0	a	First night in Vegas and wanted to check out the SLS so came here for dinner. What a huge disappointment!\n\nTable for seven people was tiny! I felt like I was sitting at the kids table. Ten feet away is where people were able to smoke while we were eating. \n\nService was very slow and spotty. Our service was very nice but we never knew when we were going to see him again. \n\nFood was not very good. We had one dish that was so bad that we sent back. Had another dish that was horrible and learned that they delivered us someone else's custom dish that had cod instead of crab. Waygu fried rice, one if their signature dishes, was not very good. Lacked depth and flavor. \n\nWaiter did bring out complimentary desserts due to all of our issues, which was very nice but did not make up for our expensive tasteless dinner. \n\nI do not recommend this place and will not come back!\n\nSide note - the SLS hotel is very underwhelming and also a hotel that I would not come back to. This hotel cannot compare to any other high end hotels on the strip. SLS in Beverly Hills is much nicer.
2023	1	a	The main reason I am writing this review, other than the fact that this place is awesome is because of the honesty of the staff.  In vegas it is rare that you find such honesty and this place has it in abundance.\nour bill was 240 between three of us, and we left a 60 dollar tip. \nMy two friends got checks that were for a 100, so mine was for 40 and i wrote in 60, but accidentally wrote my total as 300 rather than 100.  The gracious host called my room and corrected my error which is not something that they had to do.\nI have always loved Katsuya, pretty sure I wrote them a stellar review for their hollywood location.  Clearly they have a strong program for training staff, and their food is amazing too!\nGo here!!!!!!!!
2024	0	a	Stay away from this place! There is a hang running this place! We were on the guest list n already paid for the package. After keeping us an hour in the line, they tried to charge us 55 per person to get in!! We ended up getting VIP Table service at Tao for half a price for out group of 15! Font screw up your night at Vegas!
2025	1	a	I came here on the 2nd weekend that they opened ( Labor Day Weekend) since they had free entry for Dirty South with even ratio. \n\nGetting in was a cluster fuck of people and a huge mess, we arrived at the venue at 9:30 but weren't walked in by our promoter till 10:30, and spent an hour waiting in a line for no apparent reason.  Apparently alot of other people were just waiting for their promoters to just show up as well.  I am guessing since they are pretty new they are still trying to work out the kinks. \n\nI love the entry / interior decoration of this club.  They have 3 different levels but most of them are filled with tables.  So if you don't get a table you are going to end up on the edge, on the stairs or on the very small dance floor.  They have dancers hanging from the ceiling and dancers located throughout the club as well, very cirque du soleil like. \n\nThe bass/ sound system for this club is ridiculous, you can feel the bass through every part of your body.  The opening DJ for Dirty South was pretty good in the beginning, but by the end of his set he started playing some music that was just all over the place sudden drops / dubstep / electro sounding stuff that I really had no idea what it was and I wasn't feeling it at all. \n\nI would definitely come here again since the venue is so attractive inside.
2026	0	a	"OVER RATED AND DISAPPOINTING\nDO NOT GO HERE. Compared to Light and Drai's there's nothing special about LIFE.\n\nSLS is the newly renovated hotel, where the Sahara used to be. Consequently, its isolated in from rest of the strip. It's on the north end of the strip and is closest to Circus Circus. SLS has the \""LA vibe\"".  As an LA transplant, I would agree that the hotel is LA chic, but nothing special. \n\nI went on Friday Aug 29, during Grand Opening Weekend for Laidback Luke. As a local I've been to most of the clubs on the strip. I had no expectations since, I was warned that the club was so-so.\n\nBasically, Life Night Club = Exchange LA. \n\nThe rundown of the events. I contacted the promoter, got on guestlist, my group arrived at midnight 1:1 ratio guys and girls. As locals we got in free (was it a mistake? maybe). Getting the guys in free was literally the only highlight of the night.\n\nMy socal girlfriends (9 girls 1 guy) arrived before my group but were held up longer than mine. \n\nThe venue its self is VERY spacious. LIFE had acrobats and dancers like LIGHT, but they're performance was not up to par. LIFE had fewer lights than Drais. It was very dark for prolonged periods of time. The blasted really cold air into the crowd often which accounts for some of the dark times.\n\nThe opening DJ was lame. Laidback Luke was good. Thats basically it. \n\nThe bathrooms are weird. First, there's no sign for the restroom. Secondly, guys and girls share sinks. Consequently, there's no sitting space for ladies.  Men  and Women stalls basically separated by a tiny hallway (2 person width).There are no shelves in the bathroom stalls! The fuck. Where am I supposed put my drink when I go pee? \n\n\nIn summary, if your visiting don't waste your time @ Life."
2027	0	a	This club is just not good. The music is not good, the layout is poor and the people are unattractive. I really have nothing good to say about this place. Save yourself and go somewhere else. Anywhere else.
2028	0	a	"Came in Labor Day weekend and the promoter promised too many things... I should've known it was too good. Beware of BRIAN RATLEFF! I was given a price for the one guy in my party; $25 which raised to $45 when we got there. There were 9 other girls so he lowered the price when we threatened to leave bc he lied. He kept promising our group free drink tickets that never came. That wouldn't bother me except when I text him, he replied just to wait and that he'll meet me to hand them over. I waited 30 minutes bc he kept saying he was walking to where I was. Waisted my time when I had better things to do. \n\nThe crowd seemed a bit older (early 30s) The dj played EDM and the single dance floor was average. No chairs or seats anywhere. The bathrooms were clean and the attendants in there were kind. I paid $15 for bottled water.... Not happy about that. \n\nI would not return given the other venues on the strip and the fact that Brian lied to me. Oh btw, he had the audacity to contact me the next day saying he can get me \""hook ups\"" to another club. I think I'll take my business elsewhere."
2029	0	a	"I went with a group of 9 girls and 1 guy during their opening weekend which fell on Labor Day.  Promoter Brian whatever promised our group a table or at least free drinks as well as the bar being open til 1 and the guy only has to pay $25.  Too good to be true right?  Hell yeah it was!  First hour we got there we were so annoyed and pissed.  Way to start out.  Everything was major bullshit.  Didn't get a table so we wanted drink tickets.  Brian led us on a wild goose chase and kept saying \""I'll be there.\""  Mofo was a big ass liar.  Girls didn't get free drinks at all!  Lastly, he tried to charge the guy $45 instead of the $25 he promised.  Don't deal with this idiot.  \n\nPerformance? Ehh.... Not very impressive acrobatic stunts.  They all looked like they just got off a Lady Gaga music video.  Kinda creepy.  Opening DJ sucked.  Visuals sucked.\n\nCrowd? On the older side but it's not bad.  Dance floor wasn't bad as well.\n\nNo where to sit!  How annoying.  That is very vital for girls on heels.\n\nI kinda had fun so I'd give it 2 stars.  I wouldn't come back here though."
2030	0	a	Bad experience, stay away, you have been warned. Worst VIP hosts in Vegas. I have been coming to Vegas 6-8 times a year for the past 10 plus years so I know the night club game. I know most hosts are snakes but these hosts at Life/SLS take things to a new low. My friends and I stayed at SLS(mistake) and got a cabana Saturday afternoon at the SLS Foxtail pool where we spent about $2000. While we were there a host solicited us about a table at LIFE that evening. He gave us a few options but said he could get us a table for 6 on the dance floor for $3000-$3500, my friend and I discussed it breifly and said we will take it. The host made all the arrangements and we told he we would be there at 11ish after our dinner. We arrived about 11:15 to check in and he then told us the dance floor table would be $5000-$6000....WTF happened to the $3000 table you promised us??? He said we could still do a $3000 table but it was on the second or third tier, totally unacceptable!\n\nWe said no thanks, rounded up the troops and headed over to Marquee where we know we can get a pretty good table in a nice club for $3000. Good job LIFE, keep it up and you will be shuttering your doors closed in no time at all. Stay away people, keep in mind its an $18-$20 cab ride each way from pretty much every property on the strip to the SLS becuase it is out in no mans land on the far north strip.Save that $40 round trip cab ride and play a hand of Blackjack with it, your odds are better at the blackjack table than they are at LIFE.
2031	1	a	I've been to all the major clubs in Vegas, Miami, and Ibiza, and can say LiFE was amazing!  They have really taken extra steps in making the club unique.  I loved the setup of our table with holes cut out where your bottles sit.  This ensures you don't get some drunk idiot knocking over and spilling your bottle which I have had happen multiple times!! Our host was amazing setting us up with a great view of the Dj.  We had two amazing and beautiful waitresses. I loved the bathroom setup with guys and girls sharing sinks.  The best part of LiFE is the music.  They are trying to cater on Sunday nights to REAL electronic music fans.  Booking more Dj's who spin in Ibiza and Miami- not EDM rage music.  I would recommend checking out the Sayers Club beforehand- A great lounge with great drinks- I will definitely be hitting up LiFE again!
2032	0	a	So there wasn't really anything that stood out to me about LiFE nightclub, but they did overcharge me twice for the same transaction. This also happened to my friend who got charged 3x for the same transaction. And no, we were not drunk that night as I remember everything. We got to Vegas pretty late and decided to check out the new club and only had a few drinks.\n\nSave your money and time (disputing with credit card company) and head somewhere else. If it only happened to me...OK I'll just handle it with my credit card company and mistakes are forgiven. But also to a friend the same night? Something's wrong here.
2033	0	a	I was excited that a new casino the SLS had opened in Vegas.  And a new club. LIfe.  I was so unimpressed and disappointed by the club. Life is a total waste of time and money. Horrible service, rude staff  overpriced beyond rheir north strip ghetto local.  Do not waste your time. Lame
2034	1	a	Was there for opening weekend. Our VIP host set us up with 2nd tier section, although upon arrival he surprised us with the one of the best dance floor tables in the building......Thank You Richie Summers!!! We've had table service almost everywhere in Vegas and in have to say LiFE has some of the best staff around, they were on point the whole night. Standouts are Pili, Trina, Ann, Jojo, Yajira, and most importantly Richie Summers for always taking great care of us. Thank you all for being a huge part of our night! Although the SLS hotel is not for us, we will be back to LiFE.
2035	1	a	Went for Halloween this year and had a blast!  The promoters were super cool and we got right in! Comparable to any hot nightclub in Vegas-- good crowd/good music.  Club is well laid out out and pretty easy to maneuver between tables, bars and dance floor. The performers were a big plus!
2036	0	a	"My experience at LIFE was just terrible. First off I was staying at the SLS for my birthday with my two best friends and the concierge arranged for the 3 of us to get in without a cover charge and a couple complimentary drinks as long as we would get to the club by 11pm; I thought it was a really nice gesture since we were already having some problems with the staying itself. We got there at 10:30pm it was a completely mess we first got in the VIP line and they told us to go to a different line because we only had our names in the guest list. well the other line consisted of a bunch of people pile all together by the bouncer after waiting for 45 minutes our promoter got us in to the next line where we would get ID checked that's when the hostess came in and said I had to pay 55 bucks to go in I told her about what concierge told me and she told me she couldn't honor it because it was pass 11pm. I would be totally cool if I had got there after 11pm but I did not and I told her so, she called the \""door manager\"" that btw was the exactly same guy I talked to at 10:30 in the first line he did recognized me and said yes you got here before 11 but is 11 now and I CAN'T DO NOTHING. I went over again about being a LUX guest at the hotel and it was my birthday and at the top of it he knew I was there on time, nothing happenned and I ended up going to Hakkasan where I did not pay to get even without guest list and ended up getting a deal on a bottle service and Tiesto was just great. I want to say that it wasn't about the money but it was about bad service and total disrespect with me and my friends as guest."

2038	1	a	Life isn't the biggest or flashiest club in Vegas, but I had a really awesome and memorable time this past weekend. My boyfriend and I were staying at the SLS and it just so happened that one of my favorite DJ's at the moment, 3LAU, was playing on Friday night. Convenient, perfect, and fate are words that come to mind. We arrived around 12:30am and luckily there wasn't much of a line, and my VIP host friend Bryan got us right in. The club is really nice and wasn't extremely busy, but that made getting some pics taken in the photo booth quick and easy. We got an actual copy and electronic version sent through email. Bathrooms were nearby and clean with cigarettes and gum available for purchase ($20 including tip). I also thought it was kind of cool that the sink area of the bathroom is communal. The dance floor was so much fun and definitely the place to be. They handed out light sticks and the DJ was amazing - perfect for fist pumping.
2039	0	a	Zzzzzzz!  Boring, Crappy DJ (was there even a DJ or just shitty music spinning) small!  Awful bottle service!  I kinda hate everything about it!  Even getting free comp'd bottle service it was awful!  We left and actually went to our work bar!  Maybe I'm spoiled by XS and Hakkasun I don't know but it was awful!
2040	0	a	"I was at LIFE Nightclub last night at SLS Las Vegas. What a waste of a venue. I've never been to a club with louder \""music\"" in my life. And you can't even call it music, just a whole lot of base with nothing else going on. Imagine dancing to \""base\"" all night, yeah, a  lot of fun huh? Not. AVOID AVOID AVOID.\n\nNow imagine the club with the loudest music you've ever been to, you know the really annoying kind that you think \""what  the heck are they trying to do?\""....and then increase that by 3 times to the point that you cant stand it even if you wanted to because it actually hurts your eardrums and they feel like they're about to explode. AVOID AVOID AVOID.\n\nAnd that's at the entrance! When I walked down to the dance floor it was SO MUCH WORSE! How can you enjoy anything when there's no music, just a bunch of base, and feel like they're going to explode with every beat? You're going to dance when your ears are hurting and you can't have a good time? I don't think so. AVOID AVOID AVOID.\n\nThese people have no clue what good music is and the volume is just plain annoying. Not only that, it's dangerous."
2041	0	a	Last night was my first time here, and I enjoy Ingrosso.  That aside it was too loud, waaayy too loud.  It was impossible to talk to my friends.  \n\nThe venue itself seems thrown together.  It's too large--now I see why Marquee closes off sections as it gets later and why Light closes the balcony off on slow nights.\n\nYou won't see me here again.
2042	1	a	This is my first review and it's for a good reason ^__^ shout out to the super friendly staff \n\nI went to LiFE on Tuesday 12/30 to see Sebastian Ingrosso. \nWhen they started giving out free lightsticks, someone moved the box of lightsticks, causing my phone to slip into the crack between the stage and the speaker. I tried reaching for my phone but it was in too deep. The workers tried helping by using different hooks but they couldn't get it. \n\nThe next morning, we called the lost and found to see if they found an iPhone 6, and they said they hadn't. So my friends and I went over to the club again to try to talk to someone since I knew the exact location of my phone. The manager tried to look for it again, but couldn't find it. Thankfully, he let us in because we knew the location and we were able to show him where my phone was. We could clearly see my phone within all the confetti in the crack since it would light up and play the ringtone whenever we would call. Some of the workers who were setting up for the Steve Angello event tried helping out, and eventually the engineering team (I think) was called to help. \n\nSince they couldn't move the speakers (bolted to the ground), they eventually brought in vacuums, different hooks, and claw grabbers to pick up my phone. They almost got my phone at one point, but ended up dropping it at the last minute. Eventually, they couldn't see my phone anymore and so they gave up. In total, I think around eight workers tried helping me get my iPhone back. I was just really surprised that they put in so much effort to get my phone back LOL\n\nOn New Years, my friend got a call saying that they found my iPhone so we went to go pick it up at SLS ^__^ and later on in the day, one of the workers who had been trying to get my phone the day before, called to make sure that I got my phone. Turns out that they were able to pick it up by taping duct tape around a wooden stick and sliding it down LOL \n\nDespite all that, I had an amazing time at LiFE. There was barely any wait, quick service at the bar, and they gave out free lightsticks and tickets for free drinks! \n\nTL;DR: AMAZINGLY HELPFUL STAFF! they were so friendly with helping me get my iPhone back! I enjoyed the venue and the music ^_^ I had a great time here and would come back again :)
2043	1	a	Recently was in Vegas with a bunch of friends, ended up at LiFE Nightclub @ the SLS. We had such a great time thanks to Amir :) Can't wait to be back next month! If you're looking for a hook up, contact Amir 310-980-7426.
2044	0	a	"The club itself is fine, been here a couple of times. It's not big and fancy like the other mega clubs on the strip, but it's still a nice venue. However, this place is either not crowded (even on New Years) or so crowded that it's a mess. \n\nA promoter (friend's contact) promised we will get in on a Saturday, however after we got here and waited for 2 hours, he told us another promoter lied to him and we can't get in because the club is at capacity, but they can, however, let the girls in (I guess girls don't take up \""capacity\""). I've been to Marquee, XS, Hakkasan plenty of times and have never had this much trouble getting in. I don't know how that happened or how the promoters work at sbe but they should probably figure out a better system so they are not constantly lying to customers. \n\nOur friends who bought tickets in advance couldn't even get in until 12:30, but at least they got in. \n\nSo if you really want to come here on a certain night, get a table or buy tickets, at least you will eventually get in. If you are counting on being the guestlist to get in, you should probably figure out a backup plan because there's a good chance you won't get in. Although given how empty the rest of SLS is on a Saturday night, I'm not sure how long this place will be around."
2045	0	a	"Meh is a great way to summarize Foxtail.\n\nIts like a much smaller, lamer version of Surrender but acts like its better. With how overpriced the drinks are and how snobby the promoters are you would think Foxtail would have a A-list DJ line up. But nope... the likes of Calvin Harris or Hardwell wouldn't be caught dead in this C-list \""club\"".\n\nWalking into Foxtail, it seems like SLS didn't know what to do with the area next to the pool and decided to stick some lipstick on a pig and call it a dayclub. The pool area is below average and small. It shows its age and management has tried to cover up the faults with new cabanas and fresh paint; it doesn't really work. During the winter the pool is closed off and everyone is forced into what I can best describe as a little black box which serves as the nightclub.\n\nUnless you got a free table or your best friend's birthday has the misfortune of being hosted here, skip Foxtail and checkout Surrender, XS or any of the Strip's much better nightlife offerings."
2046	0	a	"Visited the Sayers Club and the other establishments inside SLS opening week.  It was a Monday night.  \n\nWe parked at 9:30 in the garage, after the valet said they were \""full\"" with their hands out.  Valet was almost empty, and this new crew of newbies (admittedly not any of the few veterans of the industry I understand they did hire) was obviously hustling the property for $20 tips to park.  I'm not adverse to having a $20 option on a crowded night, but you drive past the valet lot on the way into the garage - empty.  This kind of thing tends to happen when the typical clientele is not tipping, and the valets want to park less and get paid more.  \n\nWe arrived at Sayers Club at 9:40 p.m. They had already done last call!\n\nWe walked through the bar and to the outside area.  It looks nicer from the street.  The design is disjointed and partially blocked off by other event space.  We got the canned speech about the 'battle of the bands' they plan to have as nightly entertainment.  Sounds like high school approach to what is billed as a sophisticated venue - no thanks.  And what's with closing at 9:30 on 'school nights'?  They told me they will only be open later Thurs, Fri, Sat.  What a joke.  \n\nSUGGESTIONS:  \n\nI've been here 45 years.  I worked at the Sahara 35 years ago.  I have friends who worked there when it closed, and work there now.  The PR says SLS is after locals.  Ok, let's get local then.\n\n1.  No 'school nights' hours.  Stay open until at least midnight, better 2am\n2.  Put a dress code in the club.  No slobs.  Grown men have no business wearing shorts into a restaurant or bar.  Get serious.\n3.  No 'battle of the bands' BS, no 'dueling piano's' hustle.  Get sophisticated lounge singers and musicians which you will find at La Casa Cigar Lounge, The Barrymore, Zebra Lounge and others.  Not background music, but not loud either - sophisticated.  Grownups like to have conversations while we have a serious drink.  If you want serious bucks spent, don't cater to the mating rituals of the twenty-somethings.\n4.  Iron out that patio deal.  Get rid of the gates or whatever that is and get some good seating out there, with no piped music unless there is no live music inside, and if you do pipe it in, make it sophisticated sound.\n\nThe slogan of SLS is \""Be Legendary\"".  Sayers Club is the high end bar at the SLS, and is far from legendary.  \n\nBut it could be.  Opening week is tough, and there are always bugs to work out. I hope they step up.  I'd be back if they do."
2047	0	a	"Boring and over priced on a Friday night. I'll state up front that I can afford this place, we are not the demographic, but if this is what the 21-35 singles have to experience for nightlife at the SLS, Yikes, I feel sorry for them! We got there at 10:45pm and the crowd started arriving. A DJ was doing a good job on the turntable (or mp3 player), but there was no dance floor, so everyone was standing around. We saw that a band was setting up and thought we would hang out. I went to get a couple of drinks and learned they quickly it cost me $36 (way over priced) and my signature \""Old Fashion\"" only filled the glass half way. We sat on one of the comfortable couches only to be kicked off by a bouncer. That's fine, but if the couches are for VIP's or reserved, put a card on the table or tell people when they go in. So we went outside where there was enough outdoor furniture and attempted to have a conversation, but within 5 minutes another bouncer came over and told everyone that the patio was being closed and to go inside. So now the place is crowded and we are left standing. After 15 minutes and milking our drinks, I wondered where the band was. When I asked a bouncer, he said they would be out at 11:30pm. So we thought we would wait another 15 minutes, then 20, then 25, and at 11:45 we asked a bartender where the band was. He said they would come out whenever they felt like it, but are suppose to play a quick set by 12:30. I was already bored and all there was to do is watch everyone trying to talk over the loud music. I never saw anyone getting a second drink, and some guys weren't touching their drinks for over 20 minutes. Others were suckers and bought girls drinks, and all the girls had to do was take selfies with the guys. Total Suckers! By midnight we left, I couldn't take it anymore. I would have had more fun blowing my $36 dollars in 10 minutes on the slots or at craps. This was a total waste of time and money, and I could afford this place. If you have deep pockets to burn through money you don't care about, while you sit or stand listening to music. If that defines fun for you. Enjoy."
2048	0	a	"We are the target demographic for Sayer's Club and we are locals. Having said that, we were treated like stupid tourists and will never go back. Friday night at the bar - had drink tickets from a VIP host - ordered 2 drinks and 2 bottles of water - $32. What? Yes as it turns out, their policy is to apply the drink tickets to the \""lowest priced\"" drinks on your order, which in our case was the bottled water. I know this is Vegas but I've never been charged for bottled water when ordering a drink, nor have I had my drink tickets used for said water. We left very quickly, yet waited forever in the cold for the valet to bring our car. That's 2 locals they just lost to poor customer service and lack of respect. I now see why they're suffering $$ and having to lay off staff....."
2049	0	a	"The ONLY reason ..and I repeat the ONLY reason I stepped foot in this pretentious, Anglo filled, whack club was because my aunt was turning 60 and someone told her they \""knew someone\"" that was performing at an R&B club on the strip and could \""get us in\"". I KNEW this was a mistake when I pulled up and walked in..\n\nThe gin and tonic was $16.00 -- the same amount I just paid for a MEAL at a BUFFET.. get the _____ out of here! There were all of these \""VIP\"" areas filled to the brim with teeny tiny dresses, weak suit jackets, over processed blonde hair and \""bros\""..The VIP booths were $550.00 for a love seat sized couch and a bottle with setups. NO thanks.. I stood and looked mad..\n\nThen the \""R&B\"" performer comes on stage and he looks like Jason Mraz and kicks his \""R&B\"" set off with Calvin Harris' \""Blame\"".. are you kidding me.. what kind of R&B is this? \n\nI was so grossed out..that I apologized to my aunt (who I think was so utterly & totally confused at this point as to what was happening that she was frozen in place) and told her that I was going to play some penny slots and I would meet them when they were ready to go..So i proceeded to leave..find my lucky penny machine and drink FREE DRINKS for the rest of the night. \n\nWhat a waste of my good jeans.."
2050	0	a	For me, customer service is everything, at Sayers Club it isn't. If you have questions, issues, work with your patron, and they'll be loyal to you. Don't refuse, or say no. Sorry. Tough. Especially when it's a reasonable request.\n\nI originally intended on attending a Hollywood event by Sayers, but after finishing buying a ticket, I noticed the ticket was for Las Vegas. Your website redirected me to Vegas instead of Hollywood. This is a programming error, I selected Hollywood.\n\nAll I asked is for a refund, exchange, or something, so I can go to Hollywood instead of Vegas. I still wanted to be a patron, but instead, I get a flat out no. We don't do that.\n\nBlanket policies are the worst, it shows you don't care about your customer and only want the money. So enjoy my $90 Sayers SLS, I won't be attending. I hope it was worth losing a customer for life.\n\nI'll be sure to tell plenty of other people to avoid you at all costs as well.
2051	1	a	"This is a must visit spot! So glad these guys finally got so sense into them and came to Mill Ave! ;) Amazing food, personable friendly service. \""Ike's for the love of sandwiches\""... What is there not to love!? They also have great Veggie/Vegan options if you're into that sorta thing. Thank you, Marco, Patrick and staff for the great experience! I had \""The love triangle\"" Veggie chicken, honey mustard, BBQ, pepper jack, Swiss, cheddar + avocado, grilled onions, and jalape\u00f1o on Dutch crunch. W/SD hot sauce. ~Mmmmm :)"
2052	0	a	"This place might be great for people with dietary concerns but I'm not thrilled that I paid $10 for a sandwich that was mostly bread and lettuce.  I ordered the Matt Cain, which has turkey, roast beef, and salami.  3 kinds of meat so I'm thinking it's going to be loaded.  I was wrong.  Not only that but it was pretty sloppy, meaning the meat tended to squish out of the opposite end that I was biting into.  \n\nI'm not deducting points for this but I believe I noticed another reviewer point out that Ike's is a \""local establishment\"".  Sorry to burst your bubble but this place is a chain from the Bay Area in case the names of the menu items had not tipped you off."
2053	1	a	I had first heard of Ike's while watching a Man vs Food episode and had been wanting to try it ever since. I even it had it bookmarked for my next visit to San Francisco. I'm so glad I don't have to wait to visit San Fran to try these delicious sandwiches, since they have recently expanded to Phoenix. My first time here was at Yelp Community Event, where we were able to have a tasting menu of 4 different sandwiches. This was perfect for first timers as there's so many options to choose from. I chose from an experimental tasting menu, and my husband had the spicy tasting menu, so we were able to taste 8 different sandwiches all together. Every sandwich we tried was delicious. It's really hard to pick a favorite, the highlights were a buffalo chicken style sandwich, the Mozzarella's Big Cheese which had chicken and honey on it, the Carne Asada fries sandwich (which included just that) and the dessert sandwich of nutella and marshmallow fluff. There's a ton of substitutions available along with vegetarian and vegan options, and their bread is fresh as it's par-baked daily and then baked to order. The staff here is really passionate about their food and extremely nice and helpful. I will definitely return for Ike's amazing sandwiches.
2054	1	a	Awesome sandwich place in downtown Tempe. I actually had been meaning to try this place in Northern California but didn't get a chance while I was there. Was super pumped to find this in Arizona. It's in a fantastic location. \n\nIt's a little overwhelming going there for the first time because there are so many options to choose from. Ultimately, I chose the Bear sandwich after asking the worker a million questions and prioritizing my favorite sandwich fillings. The Bear was freakin amazing and I can see why people are obsessed with this place. The sandwich had jalape\u00f1o poppers, jalape\u00f1os, prime rib, garlic aioli (dirty sauce), mushrooms, Baked french fries, served on Dutch crunch bread.\n\nWe went during happy hour so we got free chips and a drink...so that was an added bonus. I definitely recommend this place--friendly and fast service, decent prices for a ton of food, and a fun atmosphere. Probably best for lunch though.
2055	1	a	Great place...HUGE menu....maybe read it online before you stroll in...or you will stand there like it's 1995 and you are trying to figure out what movie to rent from Blockbuster. \n\nAll our sandwiches were great. Fries were good, nothing special to me. \n\nGot really busy towards lunch time, very limited seating. Not a bad thing though! Place is booming.
2056	1	a	I liked the variety of sandwiches available.  My mom and I each got something different and then traded a half so we could sample a couple of them.  By far my favorite thing was the fried zucchini with pesto dipping sauce.  The zucchini was perfectly fried deliciousness and the pesto was fresh and wonderful.  The girls at the register were friendly, but they did miss a couple of special requests we made.  In their defense, we were new to Ike's and asking lots of questions.  The mistakes in our order weren't bad enough to complain about or send back the food.\n\nUltimately, the reason I'm rating Ike's 4 stars and not 5 is price.  We felt it was a bit pricey for sandwiches, although they are huge.  Two people could easily split one.  So if you're a penny pintcher like me, bring a friend and share a sandwich.
2057	1	a	It's crazy as a Bay Area resident it took me being in Tempe to try Ikes. All the raving is totally justified. There are so many options and creative sandwiches on the menu. I loved the San Francisco theme to it and the dutch crunch bread was like a little taste of home. I ordered the Michael Jordan (basically a meatball sub) and seriously cannot say anything bad about it. My boyfriend ordered the Matt Cain which was also delicious. Best sandwich spot I've had in the desert and maybe even ever. Can't wait to try more choices on the menu
2058	0	a	ok. so they are doing somethings right i guess. they are friendly, the place is clean. they have a pretty creative, extensive menu. that said i wasn't impressed enough to ever go back. i went there because i was walking my dog and wanted to stop for lunch they had outdoor seating so i thought i'd give it a shot. they are very chintsy (if that's even a word lol) with their dressings. my sandwich was mostly bread. i had the Count of Monte Chase-O sandwich which features ham, turkey, swiss cheese and strawberry preserves. unique huh? you couldn't tell, like i said, i tasted only the bread. if they would be even a little more generous with the lettuce, onions, meats and condiments. i like a sandwich that is as much on my face as it is in my mouth. this wasn't it. nothing fell out of this sandwich!
2059	1	a	This is the best place ever!! \nI called about my iPhone 4S to be repaired. The front and back were both cracked, the gentlemen said no problem.  I went down there it was very reasonable to repair and was done in an hour.  Picked it up and it was like brand new.  Loved the service and I would go back anytime. Thanks guys!!!!
2060	1	a	My first time visit they are awesome\nGreat service amazing knowledge\nThey did fix my iPhone 5 in 25 minutes\nI'm so thankful client for ever :)
2061	0	a	"Don't take your phones here. I brought in my iphone yesterday to get the screen replaced. While they did a good job on the repair, there became another issue. On the way to get my screen replaced I was charging my phone in my truck. Well after the repair to my screen I can no longer charge my phone. I went in today to let them know about the  issue and said I had a bad battery. Well I just upgraded my battery 6 months ago I told the employee behind the counter and they did not have an answer for me. I told them my phone was charging right before the screen replacement was done as well. He took the back plate off today to check the connections and said it was the battery. Well when I left the store  I realized that there is now a purple spot on the screen that they replaced yesterday. Well there goes $39 bucks for shitty service.\n\nDON\""T BRING YOUR DEVICES HERE!!!!!!!!"
2062	1	a	This place is awesome! I used to go to another iPhone repair store but this one is far superior! Justin helped me when I came in to get my 5s screen repaired. It only took about 15 minutes and it's just like new now! There was a little hiccup with the initial repair, but he fixed it right away and threw in a freebie to make up for the extra time. It took WAY less time than any other place I've ever been and their customer service is excellent! They are open 10-7 everyday which is great because other places I called STILL haven't returned my call to inquire about pricing, which is very affordable here. My friend referred me and I'm so glad she did! I will definitely send all my friends there and I will return if I every need such services again. Thanks!
2063	1	a	Came in with my friend's mom's phone not knowing if there was any hope for it. Justin was very professional and quickly was able to diagnose the other problems with the phone as well. The phone looks fantastic and now has working buttons! Thank you so much for the excellent service!!
2064	0	a	Another new name but the same overpriced stuff. The theater is getting more and more run-down looking. Maybe the new owners will spruce it up? I hope so--the building isn't very old...\n\nBut expect more of the same so far with Carmike Cinemas as we have experienced with Digiplex and Ultrastar before it.
2065	0	a	why does our theater keep getting bought out by all these shitty companies? amc or harkins please buy this theater in surprise, we beg of you!
2066	1	a	"Let me start by saying that I am fashionably challenged.  I'm not into the current trends or what's \""in style\"". I'm a comfort and functionality girl, if it happens to be in style, that's just a bonus for me.  I generally know WHAT looks good...I just don't know HOW to make things look good. Because of this, I never go shopping without taking a friend with me, because I don't know how to piece outfits/accessories together. \n\nHaving said that, I got bored one day and decided to try shopping on my own.  I'm also a cheapskate (no pun on the name of the store intended).  Because fashion isn't a huge deal to me, I don't like spending a lot of money to look good. I'd sold a few things at Uptown before they opened to the public (that was a great experience too!) and I loved the stuff I saw.  So I went shopping all by myself.  Mind you, I'm 30 and have had maybe one or two other successful solo shopping trips, ever. \n\nThe girls in the store were a HUGE help.  Leah first approached me to see if I needed any help, I did! She helped me pick out a few things and told me how a few shirts \""worked\"" that didn't make sense to me. I tried everything on and came out to show Leah every time.  By the third or fourth outfit, Mystic was also helping out.  Both girls were super patient with me and my many, many stupid questions.  They would both run and grab things for me that they thought may go better.  They also told me how to accessorize outfits. But above all, they were honest with me! If something didn't look good on me, they told me (in a very sweet way) that that piece probably wasn't the best option for me.  This was the most appreciated help I could have ever received.  Generally sales associates tell you everything looks good.  Then you go home or show a friend and they make a funny face and tell you to return it. Having Mystic and Leah's help was like shopping with a good friend!\n\nI left that day with a $96 bill.  I bought: a super nice, warm coat...4 shirts...a maxi skirt...and the cutest scarf I'd ever seen. I wished the owner of the store had been there that day so I could tell them how great Leah and Mystic were.  But, since she wasn't...here I am. :) You've got some great employees who really know what it means to help a customer! Thanks to Leah and Mystic for the great service and sorry it's taken me a couple of weeks to post this!"
2067	1	a	Beautiful store, wonderful customer service, and delicious cupcakes! I love the variety and the different flavored. Try the pink champagne it's amazing.
2068	1	a	These folks came thru with a Sesame \nStreet themed cake for my daughters first bday. Due to copy right laws they couldn't technically create the exact characters but instead they helped create a scene that incorporated her character toys! It was a huge hit! The cupcake toppers were ordered thru someone else but the cupcakes were AWESOME TOO!
2069	1	a	I have been going to the place for years to get my cupcake fix. Their cupcakes are delicious and moist with just the right amount of sweetness. I feel that they don't overwhelm their cupcakes with frosting like many places do, or at least other places that I've been to, and their cream cheese frosting is so good! Can't say enough great things about this place. You gotta try for yourself and I promise you won't be disappointed!
2070	1	a	I've had three cakes made my Sugarlips and they continue to amaze me with their artistry; the cake is pretty darn tasty, too!!  They really captured what we wanted for our wedding cake and we still have the very detailed handmade dragon topper still in the fridge because we can't bring ourselves to eat what is probably really tasty white chocolate because it's simply too beautifuly crafted.  I didn't have anything particular in mind for my grandmother's 90th birthday other than the topsy turvey and to make it blue.  Everyone was taken away at the fun, vibrant and delicious cake.  I'm excited to see what they come up with for her 92nd birthday next month.  I can't say enough about this company and I'm excited the Phoenix area has this kind of talent and taste.
2071	1	a	I stopped by on NYE.  The place looked clean, but I didn't stay very long. They had several flavors and I chose Red Velvet and Salted Caramel. Mmmmmmkay, dat's tasty! Frosting on RV is OMGyum.  Cake is decent.\nSC is regular cake, but good fluffy frosting and a noticeable salty taste.  I'll be returning here to try their other flavors.
2072	1	a	"Been to chiropractors off and on for years.  Dr. Owen is head and shoulders above any I've ever encountered.\nDr. Owen gets right to the issue, explains everything in words you can understand, and does not \""string it out\"" - and he doesn't try to load you up with all kinds of accessory items.\nHis concern is strictly for your well-being, and it shows.\nThanks ever so much!"
2073	1	a	I have been going to Dr Owen for over 20 years now & he is the best chiropractor in Vegas. he really connects & knows his patients. He takes great care of them as well. I would refer Dr Owen to EVERYBODY
2074	1	a	I am an always changing client! Kiko has always been able to direct and bring focus to the best style and cut for me with just the few things I tell him about what I want at that moment and he gives me the cut and color that I envisioned..He listens, and what makes him special is that he puts so much energy into making sure you leave his chair not only a satisfied client...but also a repeat client! He's that good you'll want to come back for more!
2075	0	a	"We got two plates of the \""chef's choice\"" and they were all terrible! Most of them sweet and had nothing to do with sushi. They dropped the ball. Worst sushi I have ever had!"
2076	0	a	They have clearly no ethics, and have no idea how to run a business. Sadly, they are wasting the huge opportunity of this amazing concept.
2077	0	a	We ordered delivery from Famous Potato through Grub Hub and I have to say we were pretty disappointed.  We had a 6 topping potato and 6 topping mashed potato bowl.  The potatoes tasted ok but the amount of toppings were really skimpy (MUCH skimpier than the spoonfuls shown in the video on their website).  \n\nThe most disappointing part of the order was that we paid $3.00 for an order of croquettes which turned out to be exactly 6 tater tots with a little cheese sauce poured over them.  Really?  6 tater tots? HUGE ripoff for $3.00!!!
2078	0	a	Worst experience ever.....I ordered the phone online I got the food on time but it was missing a lot of details and sides it's my first and last time ordering from famous potato
2079	0	a	really bad and disappointed experience at Vegas. The time we were exploring the manu. The owner told us any guest in the restaurant without ordering their spicy chicken should be our the restaurant. At their door advertisement, it writes the shanghai little buns are special offers in order to thanks guests support in the past 8 years. We ordered the second plate of that buns, the owner told us only the first is served with the special offer. The food their is small portion but expensive. The 15% service fee is added automaticly when we wanna check out. How can this service deserve that much service fees. DO NOT GO THERE ANYMORE. Totally disappointed.
2080	0	a	rice noodle is really bad. Staffs are not friendly.15% service fee added automatically.
2081	0	a	totally shit, shit service. The waiter told us to move the dishes ourselves when we needed to move to another table. I never write a review before but this restaurant is terrible
2082	0	a	Went in for the noodle poster on their wall, but the real noodle was sooo bad that made me lose my apperti! The noodle soup smells turning bad already. Also, they charged 15% tips automatically for such bad serves-- we waiting at front door about 5 mins to get the first waiter came to talk to us; they serve the dishes without rice so we ask for rice(charged) THREE TIMES until we finally got it. Never going there again.
2083	1	a	I have been going to Shaina for a while now for all my waxing needs. I love her new location. It is so close to mountain's edge. It is a great addition to the southwest part of the valley. Ladies getting a brazilian never gets any easier. However, you are in great hands with Shaina. She has such an upbeat personality. Shaina will have you laughing during your entire appointment that you actually forget your getting a brazilian. Her technique is quick, so you're not there thinking how much longer is this going to take. Check her out if you live in the southwest part of the valley.
2084	1	a	Shaina is absolutely amazing! This was the first time that Shaina has done my eyebrow waxing and it was so nice that she spent time getting to know exactly how I liked them and what I wanted. She gave my suggestions on what she thought would look best for me. I felt so comfortable with her doing them and loved that she wasn't rushed. She took her time and made sure I was happy with them. She did them right the first time and I didn't need or want anything changed but if I did she would have happily of done it and not acted annoyed, like previous places I have gone to. After she was done she even gave recommendations on how to keep my eyebrows looking good in between visits with her. I didn't have an appointment and just popped in and she was able to get my right back, which was nice since I had my daughter with me. The place is decorated really cute and is super clean and inviting. Definitely recommending her to my friends and family. I just recently moved to California and am sad that I won't be able to come to her regularly,  especially since I just found her.
2085	1	a	Seriously awesome and adorable little boutique. This was my first time getting my legs waxed (hubby was coming home from deployment) they told me everything I needed to know and made me feel so comfortable!! And to boot it stung a little...but really not as bad as I thought! will totally be returning :)
2086	1	a	Shaina was very friendly! Everything was clean and hygienic. She did a great job! When I was looking for a good place to go to, hygiene was #1 on my list. Wipes were provided to freshen up, she wore gloves, fresh paper was laid on the waxing bed, there was no double dipping, gentle and effective wax, fabric sheets to remove the wax were used instead of pressed or paper ones, and she used focused light throughout to make sure she found all the hairs. She then went in with tweezers to remove the few hairs that were left. It was a wonderful experience. I got there late and I was still taken in. It also only took about 15 minutes. Shaina made it as painless as possible and also had me do breathing techniques for the more sensitive areas. It was a breeze! Also, on the website they also let you know not to worry about trimming which was nice so I didn't have to worry about preparing beforehand.
2087	0	a	Not impressed with these scam artists. I went to The Range at Ballantyne for the first time yesterday. After I got checked in and watched the safety video, I had to wait 10 minutes while they figured out which lane another customer was on so they could charge him. It was like watching the three stooges use a computer for the first time. Once I got on the range, I was happy to find that it was state of the art and had a good 30 minute shooting session using a pistol. Then the bait and switch happened. It is supposed to be $19/hr pistol, $25/hr rifle. When I was rung up, it came up as $25/hr. They said because I used FMJ I was charged the rifle rate. Pistols rate is only allowed if you use Total Metal Jacket (TMJ). Not once was this brought up until it was time to pay. Because they only allow full hour sessions and after tax, my 30 minutes of shooting pistol cost $27!!! NEVER AGAIN!
2088	1	a	We're so excited that we found a great, locally owned pizza place by our house.  We ordered for the second time this evening.  Our first time we got the buffalo chicken pizza, mozzarella sticks, and jalapeno poppers.  Tonight we got the BBQ chicken pizza, mozzarella sticks, and chicken fingers.  I highly recommend all of these items.  They were all amazingly delicious!  The staff is super nice and delivery is fast!  I love this place!
2089	1	a	I discovered this place a few weeks ago and can't stay away from it.  Not only is their pizza great but the Joe Philly's Burger is the most unique and delicious burger I have had in Vegas since I moved here a year ago.  The food is lovingly cooked by the owner and you can tell he really has passion for what he does.  The staff are all friendly and you can not beat the fantastic prices.  This is my favorite spot for tasty fast food.
2090	0	a	I've been to Joe's 4x now with friends. Each time we all have tried different items on the menu to try and get something we found that we actually liked. We've tried the pizza, wings, burgers, and Philly cheese steaks. Each time we all left feeling like we didn't want to go back, but it's the kind of location you wish you could.\n\nPizza - pizza hut quality crust & sauce quality with papa murphy's (frozen pizza) quality toppings. The pizza was a mess. The toppings rolled right off of the pizza and ended up on your plate in a big mess rather than in your mouth. The quality of the toppings were mediocre. We got a supreme pizza (large) and it fed 2 of us but wasn't something I would go back to eat again. You could get a higher quality pizza at a franchised pizza delivery service (for less $$ too) even though we dined in.\n\nBurgers - had a western burger and it was decent. It's not a burger joint but the patty and bun were good. The fries weren't good. On multiple visits we tried the fries and each time we couldn't try more than a couple. They were hot, but the taste was incredibly bland and tasted worse than if they had just used a frozen bag from the supermarket.\n\nWings - the best thing at Joe's. Well breaded, tangy sauce. Multiple members of the group stated this was consistently the best thing they tried. The only problem was that I wouldn't go to a pizza place to get wings. This is kind of the general problem - too many options on the menu with not enough focus. Is it a pizza place? Deli? Burger Joint?\n\nService - there are always a lot of employees. They all seem nice enough but almost every time we have been there the staff acts as if they've never taken an order before. Again, the staff is polite but untrained or socially awkward.\n\nWater - we were charged $1 for a cup of tap water and we weren't told about that before we paid for it. If we would have known we would be charged for tap water we would've gotten a soda. \n\nThis is a place I really wish I could like. The people making the food and taking the orders seem very nice. It's also local, so I want it to succeed but it just seems to lack focus around the menu and the ingredient quality. I know this place has (12) 5 star reviews which I think are all from the staff so I wanted to write something realistic to help other yelpers in their food decisions.
2091	0	a	"\""Meh. I've experienced better.\"" sums up my experience with the place. I've been here a few times and have tried a couple of different items and have pretty much had the same experience each time.\n\nThe Goods: Friendly service, decent wings & good crust & sauce on the pizza. \n\nThe Not-So-Goods:\n\nIt's kind of hard for me to pin-point what exactly is wrong with this place. The servers are friendly, but they don't seem to know what can and can't be done. Example: I ask for a small cup of water and here is what I was replied with the times I asked - 1) Grab a bottle of water and it should be fine. 2) Sure, here's a cup and you can use the fountain. 3) Ok, I will give you a cup but be sure not to fill it up with soda...AND THEY THEY CHARGED ME FOR FOUNTAIN SODA ANYWAY (I didn't realize until after I paid). \n\nTo continue with the lack of consistency, even though we eat in every single time, we are often brought out food already boxed up as if we ordered pick-up or delivery. One time once we ordered a pizza, the server walked out with the pizza in the box without any plates or utensils (you might ask why utensils...read later). At least attempt to cater towards your dine-in visitors. \n\nLets talk about the pizza. I am a major pizza enthusiast and I don't believe there is a such thing as a bad pizza. But I've never been more disappointed with a pie in such a long time.\n\nI tried the supreme pizza and outside of the crust and sauce...everything was such a complete hope mess. It just seemed like they threw on numerous frozen vegetables, and then caked a lot of cheese on the top of the toppings and assumed that was it.  The peppers, and onions weren't fully cooked and the toppings were so heavy, I could barely even hold a slice without all of the cheese and toppings falling off. This is why having utensils would be nice so I can at least some pieces and eat the pizza with the cheese and toppings in one bite.\n\nThis pizza would be somewhat passable if they only delivered, but if I'm dining in, I would expect some kind of quality increase since the pizza would generally be fresher. I severely question the reviews that say this is the best pizza in town. I understand that this is a local establishment, but that doesn't mean it should get favorable reviews for unfavorable flavors. \n\nIs this better than Digorno? Nope\nIs this better than Little Caesars? Sorry...but not really. I like LC though, but why would I come to a place that has lower quality pizza for double the price of LC ($8 for a supreme)?\n\nDespite the fact that some of their other food is decent (mainly the wings), I place a heavy weight on the pizza itself. I really wanted this to be a great place, but #soniamdissapoint.\n\nIt just seems like they are on the cusp of making a damn good pizza, hopefully they take actual criticism and will make proper adjustments. If anyone is wondering why am I so critical of the pizza, it's because it's a pizzeria.\n\n#idonotproofreadsomyreviewsmightsoundlikegibberish"
2092	0	a	"We ordered the Philly sandwich (husband said it was good) and also had a White Pizza.  The fries could use some work.  They tasted very greasy like the oil needed changing or something.  It was greasy and brown.  Yuck.  The pizza was just \""okay\"".  The reason I say that is because I'm a garlic lover and the garlic tasted a little off, like maybe they are using bottled garlic or something.  Staff are super friendly and nice. Hope they make it."
2093	0	a	This pizza is very mediocre, and looks like a blind drunk assembled it. I also asked for parmesan and chili pepper. . . they didn't come. The up side is that it is edible, and was open at 10 pm on a thursday. So that's nice. I am really surprised that this place got 4.5 stars. I am assuming that most of the people who eat here either don't get pizza, or are drunk. I would order from here again if I had no options though. So take that info however you like.
2094	0	a	"I've tried Joe's Philly several times after I received a menu on my door a few months ago. I have to say I've had better, but it's a decent place to grab a cheap, quick lunch.\n\nI'm not sure why it's called \""Joe's Philly's Pizza\"" as that seems kind of confusing. Are they about the pizza? Are they about the Philly Cheesesteak? I didn't know that Philadelphia was known for their pizza.\n\nAnyway, in three visits, I've ordered their cheesesteak twice and it was pretty good. I've eaten a lot of cheesesteak sandwiches in my life - I would have to say this ranked somewhere in the middle to lower spectrum. However, the lunch special comes with fries and a fountain drink for around $6. I do have to comment that the fries were pretty soggy and under salted. The sandwich itself is not bad, it could use more meat, cheese and onions and peppers. The bread was decent as well.\n\nI've also gotten the chicken wings. The wings were actually pretty good. Not the best I've had, but definitely not the worst. The amount of buffalo sauce really varies. Sometimes they've smothered the wings and other times there's hardly been any on them. Either way, I think it tastes just like Jack's Hot Sauce, so I'll just put that on if I go back again.\n\nThe service is pretty quick. They usually have your order to you within 10 minutes (usually less). All in all, it's not a bad place, but fairly mediocre. I'll have to try the pizza  if I go there again."
2095	0	a	Its been about a month since the last time I ordered anything from here. I ordered about 3 times in about a month or two, and then pretty much gave up. I saw some really good reviews about this place, and was excited thinking finally I can get some good pizza. First time I tried it I said to myself that it was ok, maybe it was a fluke. Second time it was kind of the same thing. Funny, I even tried a third time and uh, well, its not good. There's nothing good about this place in my opinion. I think that it is almost impossible that this place has a single legit 5 star review. The people seem very friendly over the phone so its not like I'm venting over a bad experience or anything like that. Its just the food is not even really average. From the pizza, to the wings, to the cheesesteak. I tried quite a few things just hoping that it would be at least decent so I could have a convenient place to order from, and no luck. I wont be ordering from here again, and right now I'm looking at a bunch of 2 star reviews here on the screen about this place, and they are really accurate. It is kind of irritating to me that I think this place had like 10+ reviews total that all gave them 5 stars. Not a single 4 or less star review, and the food is really below average. Not cool.
2096	0	a	Pizza was super greasy, they took a slice of cheese pizza and put all the toppings on it then melted it in the oven... so the ham and sausage was cold. Also 3.50 for one slice totally not worth it. Unfortunately I cannot recommend this place.
2097	0	a	"1st time here and let me say not impressed with the service and food! Right when we walked in we waited awhile before someone finally greeted us, and all we can stare at are her hickied covered neck! Lol. So professional. We sat down and waited, and noticed the bartender(?) put cups over her ear/hair while talking to her co workers and then put them back on the shelf! (Where are the managers?!) seems like teenagers running the place.\nI ordered the \""jumbo\"" shredded chicken burrito, and let me say you can get so much more for 7 bucks at chipotle and taste way better. My burrito taste way to salty, no flavor whatsoever! Just go to Taco Bell and get a soft taco you'll get the same product taste for a cheaper price.\n\""Welcome to your new addiction\"" \nNo thanks I'll pass and stick to chipotle with good service and food!"
2098	0	a	My husband and I just had dinner here and let me tell you we will not be back.....if you are craving authentic Mexican food, don't go here everything tasted very processed and out of a can and over priced for a small amount of food......
2099	0	a	I have been here three times already. The taco plate is really tasty, along with the cilantro rice. The restaurant is always clean. That sums up what was good, now for the rest. The service is utterly disgraceful. They don't listen to your order at all, even when you send the food back. I involved the onsite district manager who had nothing but attitude to offer me. The food is great, but the service sucks. I won't be back.
2100	0	a	"Fuzzy's Taco Shop has a cool name going for it but that's about all that it has going for it.\n\nThey have a lot of room in the dining room and a separate bar area where you can order beer on tap or in bottles and other assorted mixed drinks. There's even an outdoor patio.\n\nSince they don't have carnitas tacos I ordered a grilled fish, fajita and ground beef tacos. I took one bite of the grilled fish taco and said \""no bueno\"". The ground beef and chicken tacos were kind of lackluster, but passable. \n\nI spent $11.49 for lunch on three tacos and a large soda. BTW - bring back the souvenir cup and only pay a dollar for your soda. Unfortunately, I doubt that I'll be back considering the hefty price tag and the lackluster taste to their food."
2101	1	a	I've been to fuzzy's multiple times on mill. And it it amazing, witch is why I drive from central PHX all the way to Mill Ave in Tempe for more. But I wanted to try out there new location on 44th st. And Thomas , guess what.... Still amazing and great customer service . They came up consistently  asking if they could get me anything or if I was enjoying my food. Either way , I recommend going to either location!!!! A++ in my book!
2102	0	a	So any Taco place that opens up in Central Phoenix will always be critiqued to the max as there are so many great taco places in town from dives to gourmet. I had high hopes for this place but it may do good business feeding ASU students at its Tempe location but not here in CenPhx! We tried this place twice. The first time we ordered burritos. These are like a cross between a burrito and a sandwich wrap - not what I'm looking for! There was a lot of mayo and lettuce stuffed in ours, it did not mention that on the menu unless they gave us the wrong order! We also give places a second chance so I tried to pick up some breakfast burritos to try them one Sunday morning. Placed our order then 10 minutes later they told me they did not have any potatoes, this was at 8:30 a.m.! I asked for my money back but it took an additional 20 minutes as the cashiers did not have access to the registers and they needed to wait for their manager to come back! They did nothing to win me over, you think I could have gotten a free meal or something but the likelihood of me ever going back to Fuzzy's is slim to none! Too bad, it's a great location!
2103	0	a	The food is ok it's sub par TexMex something to the tune of a homemade attempt at Taco Bell. Really wish it would have had something that would make me want to come back I've tried this place 3 times as I like to give a place a few chances. Probably won't be back.
2104	0	a	"If I could give this place 0 stats I would. The food was horrible. I had a jumbo burrito, tempura shrimp to be exact, a grilled fish taco, and guacamole n chips. I had a shock top which wasn't very cold but probably the best tasting thing I had there. The burrito was filled with beans, rice and lettuce, it's supposed to be a shrimp burrito and there were 5 SHRIMPS (keep in mind it was a jumbo burrito)!! I was so disappointed that I didn't eat any of it after a few bits. Someone that worked there asked how everything was tasting and I said well not very good, she answered and said \""well is the shock top good at least?\"" And I said yeah probably the best thing here. And she walked away so carelessly. That shows you how they could careless about the food they provide. \n\nDon't waste your money, time or appetite just so be Unsatisfied to say the least!"
2105	0	a	I will start by stating that I love the spicy pork nachos. They are delicious. I have eaten at the restaurant and gotten take out a few times, with nothing particularly notable (although my husband says his food it's always cold, I guess I'm less picky about that). Then, tonight, things took a turn for the worse...\nI picked up my take out and got home to unpack it, only to realize that they didn't give me the queso and put the wrong kind of meat on my nachos. Since I only live about five minutes away I called and informed the employee who answered that I did not get my queso and that there was the wrong kind of meat on my nachos. She asks me to bring it in so I can show her.  So I tell her sure, but I'd like to get an order for the correct nachos started, to which she hesitantly agreed. \nWhen I arrive, I get no apology, but an accusation that I didn't understand that the queso comes in a separate bowl and questioning about the kind of meat. Then she proceedes to show the cook, just to make sure I'm not wrong about the meat, which is irrelevant, because I am not taking soggy chips with cold meat home just because they didn't give me the queso and I had to drive back to get the food that I'd already paid for. \nI don't even mind that they forgot the queso because mistakes happen, but to forget the queso, put the wrong meat on my nachos AND be completely unapologetic about it after I had to drive back is completely infuriating. \nSo if you like cold food to go, please check your food before you leave the establishment so that you, too, will not suffer the lack of customer service.
2106	0	a	I think this place is confused.\nI am not sure what the theme is here, it reminds me of a taco shop in San Diego, but I am not sure if they think they are a sports bar a fast food place or a restaurant. So lets go into that a little bit further. \n\nSo sports bar...the place has about 9 or 10 TVs...9 or 10 TVs that all should have been bigger in my opinion. They are all about I want to say about 40 inch TV's they should have gone a bit bigger, unless your sitting right below one, you really can't see what's on it with any discernment. And if you are sitting below one you have to look almost straight up, which makes for an uncomfortable experience. They were playing the NFL network, about the only reason this place even gets one star...but you couldn't even read the ticker on the bottom of the screen from across the isle...so in my opinion they went to small with the TV's. \n\nThe beer menu...they don't have one!!!??? The counter girl couldn't tell me what they had off hand really but did know it was happy hour and rattled off some 3 odd tap beers. PBR, Coors, and some other garbage swill...not impressed.  I wandered over to the bar area, they have a full bar, but might have gone a bit overkill with it, maybe they think their a nightclub?! I ended up ordering a Corona...12 Oz Corona $4.25 outrageous price. Happy hour at Sushi Brokers 22oz Corona $6. Better deal and its a sushi place, so literally $4.25 considering they are paying about .80 cents a piece for them is outrageous. Overpriced beer, plus the Corona tasted a bit stale, it was cold, but it seemed like it was maybe heated and then cooled one too many times. No good. \n\nFast food place or restaurant...you decide!!?? \n\nThe seating is general seating, you walk in and walk up to the counter like its a fast food place, the menu is above your check out girl, pretty easy to read, lots of suggestions. I ordered the Chicken Fajita Burrito. THIS COMES WITH NOTHING. Chips and salsa are additional. So Chips Salsa and the beer with burrito...$14.25...where am I? Tee Pee's, Manuel's, Macayo's...with these prices I feel I should be sitting at a table and should have a waiter, not seating myself. \n\nOn a separate note, I never actually was given a receipt ever...showing me prices...HUGE RED FLAG...I only got a food ticket to show what I ordered.\n\nSo they give you a buzzer chip like the ones you get at a Cheese Cake factory and tell you when your food is ready to go to the counter and get it. OK...so about 10 minutes go by and mine goes off. Not to bad a return time, but granted it was slow considering I was the only one in the building, besides staff and this was 5pm on Friday by the way. So I walk up to grab it and get a look in the kitchen. It's dirty!!!  I mean real dirty, this place was dead but the grill looked like it had been cooked on for a party of 500, it definitely hadn't been cleaned in a minute. Not sure if I really want my customers to see that...they are definitely not True Food, even thou their prices reflect that they want to be. \n\nSo I sit down, a bit hesitant already. On the plus side the burrito is a descent size, not as big as Chipolte but bigger then Taco Bell. And it tastes OK, not great not worth $8. Chips and salsa...chips are just OK nothing to write home about, definitely had better...the Salsa...actually was pretty amazing...but they give you a huge basket of chips with one cup of salsa, not enough salsa, to many chips. So I go up to the counter and ask for more salsa. $1.29!! I also ask for some guacamole. $2.49. So almost $4.00 extra for this. My check is now almost $20!!! \n\nI have to go back up to the kitchen counter to get it, once again this gives me time to look into the kitchen on how dirty it is. Gross. So here is the kicker thou...I get my Guacamole...charged me 3 times as much a Chipolte would or any other place for that matter. Best part, my little cup is only part guacamole, when I get to the bottom of the cup, its filled with shredded lettuce, so your not quite getting a full cup worth of guacamole, their shorting you and adding a filler. It's a rip off. \n\nSo to top off my fast food experience, as its apparent I have to put my own dishes away in a little tub above the trash along with your basket and tray. As I am doing this, some girl comes in off the street goes to the counter and asks the girl for a donation for her dead brother or something in exchange for some candy...and of course she makes a beeline for me being the only customer in the joint, and yes hits me up too. Not my idea of a good dining experience in any circumstance anywhere.\n\nSo I would give this place a half star for having the NFL network on...that's about it. But once again no half star system on yelp.\n\nBut I would not suggest going here, being in the restaurant and hospitality industry for almost 20 years, I don't expect this place to be open very long unless they make some serious changes. Not worth the experience, there is no novelty. Don't go.
2107	0	a	some of the food was cold. it is an odd take on Mexican food, with unique sauces and such. It is what I would expect from great Midwestern Mexican. Overall disappointment.

2109	0	a	0-3 stars for food\n0-2 stars for service\n\nFirst impression was great!  Family sharing food off to the right and they looked happy. \n\nI was doing takeout and was greeted by 2 females. The awkward moment came when I had to ask for a menu,they didn't even ask if I wanted to eat here or takeout. \n\nThey don't have lunch specials on the weekend but that wasn't stated on the menu. \n\nDifferent sizes of meals and appetizers not listed on menu\n\nThey gave 2 free egg rolls with the meal but they\nare bitter and soggy on the inside.  It also has a smokey taste\n\nI got home and they didn't even give me my wallet shrimp. After digging through everything it turns out that they gave me wonton soup.\n\nThe crab puffs are greatly filled but it's not crab.  Not even imitation crab.  It's more liquid that came out of a piping bag. \n\nI was hungover and didn't want to deal with it anymore. I drove by the place.  Dropped off the soup and went somewhere else. \n\n0 - the food because I didn't get what I ordered and the crab puffs had 0 crab in it. \n\n0 - they got my order wrong and didn't offer me a menu. \n\nI can't give a 0 so 1 star it is
2110	1	a	Odd timing and pacing and incorrect orders served made for an awkward dining experience at the latest spot by Elizabeth Blau and Kim Canteenwalla. Their staff, however, was well trained in the congeniality department, as their friendly demeanor tried to overcome service issues.\n\nA half rack of ribs was as tender and smokey as expected, brushed with a sweet and tangy BBQ sauce. The bacon cheddar biscuit was amazing, trumping any childhood memories of devouring cheddar biscuits from that chain seafood restaurant I won't bother naming. I'm a fan of the mac and cheese, mainly because pork makes everything better. The black mission figs was a refined dish of nuanced flavors that almost seems out of place among all the comfort food. Chicken wings are available in different flavors. The buffalo wings were too subtle and didn't pack enough heat. The crab cake was somewhat underwhelming, mainly because of my irrational east coast bias and the lack of jumbo lump meat, which I prefer.\n\nThis place will only get better once they find their footing. Pricing may turn off some, but their location in Tivoli Village is to blame as I'm sure rent isn't cheap. \n\n3.5 Stars
2111	1	a	Seven Yelpers and two Yelpers-in-training, AKA small children with good taste, arrived at 11:30am on the Saturday after Made LV opened its doors for business. Basically the first ones there, the empty restaurant eventually filled up as we made our way through much of the menu together.  Because we shared, it was a good way to taste a bit of each dish.\n\nWe had:  Cheesy Garlic Toast, Bacon Cheddar Biscuits, Pimento Cheese, Smokey Bleu Cheese Fondue, Black Mission Figs, Bacon & Eggs, Baked Artichokes, Breakfast Poutine, Dirty Mac N Cheese, Chopped Chicken Liver, Butcher Style Chicken Wings,  and all three of the desserts, Bag of Donut Holes, Banana Pudding, and the Loaded S'mores Nachos.  14 dishes, with 2 orders of each one, came to $231 and change.\n\nHighlights for me:\nI loved the biscuits--the honey salt butter accompanying them is wonderful.  I must get my own order next time because I only had a small piece since we were sharing.\nI am also a fan of the pimento cheese, something I haven't had since I was a little girl in the Dark Ages.  This is a generous serving, literally a jar of pimento, so when you run out of crackers and pretzel chips, just ask the friendly servers for more.   I ate a lot of this! \nThe mac n cheese with burnt pork ends is a good version that I'd have again, as well as the figs with goat cheese, pistachio, and pomegranate seeds.  Of the three desserts, I liked the donuts the best, but that's only because I'm not a big fan of the other two desserts offered, in general.  And, the donuts are served up warm with cinnamon sugar, my favorite; I'd love them even more with chocolate sauce instead of the berry one that they came with!\nService was excellent from start to finish and Chef Kim Canteenwalla made it a point to visit our table more than once, as well as the other diners in the restaurant.\n\nOpen Wed-Sun, 11:30am - 11:00pm\nMonday and Tuesday, 4:00pm-11:00pm\nHappy Hour,  4:00pm-6:00pm, Monday through Friday.\nWelcome to Tivoli Village, MadeLV; I think you'll be making more fans along the way.

Offering a relaxed environment with touchtunes playing at a modest levels beneath a bistronomic tin-style ceiling as the Little League World Series showed on a pair of LCDs it was at a large banquette that our party was sat and with the open atrium bathed in sunlight our meal began quickly, the service spot-on throughout our two hour stay with several visits from the Chef himself assuring all was well.   Speaking next to the quality of the food it can only be said that while perhaps 'simple' by some standards the execution of nearly every dish of the afternoon was nothing short of exemplary and with much of our order trending towards the menu's heavier offerings it was perhaps unsurprising that flavors presented with aplomb, the cheddar biscuits a full-frontal savory assault finding levity in the creamy house blended butter while both the pimento cheese and rich fondue arrived in plethoric portions with extra chips and crackers offered compliments of the house.  Moving next to things more complicated the very few faults of the meal were found in early-season figs that had not yet found maximum sweetness and fries that trended slightly less crisp than savory toppings would afford but with deviled eggs set aside crisp bacon soon followed by reference standard mac n' cheese plus juicy wings rife with smoke beneath intensely crisp skin one would be hard pressed to complain - a trio of All-American sweets every bit on par with the savories finally rounding out a meal that more that lived up to the restaurant's promise of \""good food, good drinks, and good company\"" from beginning to end."
2113	1	a	We were here for lunch last weekend and the food and service were both excellent! It's been a long time since we've received such great service. We had the pulled pork sandwich with sweet potato fries and fish & chips. Both dishes were great but I think the pulled pork was our favorite. We will definitely be back again soon.
2114	1	a	Nice new restaurant in Tivoli. Excellent service, food, and atmosphere. The room is a bit noisy but bearable. \n\nWe had crab cake, oysters, fish & chips, and smores nachos. All were very tasty and served very creatively. Service was very good. Some decent cocktails on the menu, decent wine list, and an okay draft beer list. Nothing special but decent. Worth a visit.
2115	1	a	Ok, so she's not new to the restaurant game! So I'll bang out the negative part of this review. It's loud. I mean REAL LOUD! There were 3 of us & we had to practically YELL in order to hear one another. The challenge? The high vaulted ceilings lined with tin/aluminum tiles that resonates the loudness even MORE! One more minor negative. The service. They are on top of it like their SUPER a game! They're SO on top of it that they barely allow you to finish a plate before they come by to pick up your dishes. Just slow you roll, and let us enjoy our meal and our time there.\n\nOk, enough with that, cause I got some GOOD stuff to say! The food? AWESOME!! The clams were YUMMINESS!!! The toasted bread was so good! We ordered every single small plate item plus the mac n cheese and those clams PLUS the s'mores nachos! Let me tell you, not once were we disappointed! Everything was AMAZING and SUPER yummy!!! You need to go before it gets too crazy to get in!!
2116	0	a	"i kinda like honey salt so I was interested in experiencing the new venture.  I think i get what they are trying to do but the place has a severe identity crisis.  the menu isn't small but it feels like it. the beer menu flat out sucks.  another huge turn off is that the \""happy hour menu\"" is only available at the bar or if you are sitting in \""high chairs\"".  seriously? food wise, no surprise, it's pretty good.  we started with a jar of pimento cheese.  the taste was good but it was too creamy for me with no discernible visual evidence of pimentos.  the vegi accoutrements were pretty sad and a biscuit would have been a nice touch.  I had the hot dog for dinner.  it was really good but at $9.75 I would have expected more effort put into the fries that came with the dog.  they were pretty blah.  the donuts in a bag looked interesting for dessert but because I had applauded honey salt in my yelp review for resisting the 2005 rage, I passed on dessert."
2117	1	a	We were excited to try this new spot in Tivoli Sq. The food was SO GOOD!!\nThere were so many interesting things on the menu, we could not decide so we just ordered a bunch of stuff and family styled everything. Let me tell you, that is the way to go!\n\nFood....The chicken wings were so moist and fresh! (not not frozen!), the eggs and bacon - Deviled eggs and pork bell - So good! Fig Salad- OMG YUM. You get the point. The food ROCKS!\n\nOur service was excellent! The decor is very sexy, eclectic and rustic in a cool way. My ONLY complaint is it was SO CRAZY LOUD! The interior is wood floor, glass and a tin ceiling. All noise bouncing materials! When it was really busy, we were yelling across the table. With that said, would that stop me from going back? NO, the food is so fantastic, I will deal with a loud room, or maybe request the back area that seemed a little bit quieter.
2118	1	a	Our first visit here.   Cool fun vibe...smaller than I expected though.  Service was attentive and friendly.\n\nWe shared the roasted figs with goat cheese.  I could eat that all day.  Nom nom nom!\n\nNext we shared the double burger.  Very tasty and juicy meat.  We opted to leave it just the meat and cheese. It didn't need anything else.   Great bun too! \n\nTopped off the meal with the homemade donuts. The fresh berry dipping sauce made the dessert.  Raspberry BlackBerry reduced in fresh squeezed orange juice.  Very nice!\n\nWe'll be back!
2119	1	a	We went to Tivoli for dinner and stumbled upon this place. Petty sweet spot with lots of TV's to view some sports events.  Started off with a couple drinks. I had the Bernie Lomax it was great. We didn't order any entrees we just ate the small bite plates. Had the figs there were just amazing. Tried the Loaded Mac and cheese which was to die for.  Also had there version of bacon and eggs which was another great dish. We had great service and great fresh food. Definitely will be going back.
2120	1	a	Fall weather calls for fabulous patio work lunches.\n\nWe arrived before the lunch rush and were seated out on the patio. They have a lot of great options, so we decided to share a number of items and we couldn't resist dessert.\n\nWe had the baked artichoke, mussels, corn and shrimp fritters, extra garlic bread to sop up all the rest of the juice from the mussels and we topped off our delicious lunch with freshly made doughnuts with raspberry dipping sauce.\n\nEverything was great and I look forward to coming back to try the rest of their menu. I highly recommend the mussels and baked artichoke. Service was great and refills were plentiful. \n\nI haven't been to Tivoli very often, but with places like Made LV, I'm willing to explore Tovoli a little more often.
2121	1	a	What an interesting menu...so fun to order a lot of smaller plates and try different things. Our server, Siera was FABULOUS! It was my husband's birthday as well as another gentleman's in our party, she made the evening so special. She is so personable and took my shellfish allergy serisously (not everyone does...she said all the right things and checked back many times to ensure all was looked after while being prepared...that means so much!) The burger was amaaaaazing! We will be back and will ask for Siera!
2122	1	a	Fun atmosphere with fun food.  Great crafted cocktails and classy beer selection.  We had fun playing the classic board games and cards. It felt like a catered house party.
2123	1	a	Maddy is the best!!! Stop in an enjoy the best bar service ever!! Locals stop by and enjoy!!
2124	1	a	The lunch menu has a variety of choices, appetizers, salads, sandwiches and entrees plus desserts. \nIt was a beautiful day to enjoy the west patio which has a bounty of shade umbrellas. A small disappointment was no figs on the menu because they are out of season. Our server was friendly and helpful. Her assistant brought the water promptly after being seated. However he never returned to ask if we wanted a refill.\n\nThe BBQ Pulled Pork sandwich was tender and juicy. It was run down your hand juicy. The sandwich was piled high with BBQ and topped with coleslaw and 3 pickles on top of the toasted bun. This was great tasting BBQ with not much smoke. A visit to the wash room for hand washing was required at conclusion. The sandwich includes a container of sweet potato fries that was more than I could consume. However the fries were delicious. A container of mustard aioli is nice for dipping the fries and even sladdered on the sandwich bun.\n\nThe Nueske Hot Dog was not up to the Gold Standard (Windy City Dog). It was beer steamed, covered with sauerkraut and grain mustard. The Hot Dog comes with regular fries that were tender,  tasty and grease free.\n\nMade LV  menu has many choices and I look forward to returning for more.
2125	1	a	Major yum. But a little history...\n   I went with my friend C to Made LV with some trepidations. C had been to the sister restaurant Honey Salt and said the food was amazing but the service was lacking. We went to Made LV with some concern that the service would be lacking.\n   Well, we needn't be so concerned. The staff was warm and friendly and our server was a bright young man with a generous smile. He made sure we were happy with everything. And were we!\n   Both of us had had huge lunches so we weren't super hungry so we decided to go with apps and a salad. We ordered the smoked onion dip, the mac and cheese with pork ends and the truffled queso dip with a Caesar salad. The smoked onion dip was really lovely with a creamy base and the onion didn't slap me in the face which is nice. The truffled cheese dip was warm, silky and made me close my eyes to savor it. Both came with house made chips which were super yummy. The mac and cheese is just amazing with cheddary accents and a punch of smokiness. The peas lend sweetness and the pork bits give it some heft and tang. The Caesar salad was amazing. It wasn't overwhelming with any particular flavor which is a problem with Caesar salad dressings. The croutons are light, crunchy and amazing. They were really good with the salad but even better with the truffled cheese dip. A possibly switch out that would be great.\n   If you're off at Tivoli shopping, do check out Made LV.
2126	1	a	Food was amazing. Love that they have different card games and board games available for families while we are at the table. They need to make a lot more non pork options available. Otherwise the food was fantastic.
2127	1	a	Made reservations for the latter part of lunch time and was greeted by Jeff, who was also our server. He was very VERY attentive but not intrusive. He was there when we needed him and allowed us time to hang out and catch up. We were there to celebrate my girlfriend's birthday and he made the experience wonderful. His attentiveness and thoughtfulness even made the paying for the check easy and uneventful, no fighting for the check!\n\nWe started with a couple of appetizers: Dirty Mac and Cheese and the hummus, both were awesome. The kids order burgers off their very creative book menus to keep the kiddos occupied and we ordered the half chicken and calms. Everyone walked away full and definitely planning on our next visit to MadeLV. Another incentive for me is that they have Steigl Grapefruit beer, one of my favorites.  We loved the Christmas ambiance, Jeff was amazing, and the food was great. American tavern with a twist, definitely a great addition to Tivoli.
2128	0	a	WOOOOOOOW.   sometimes the smallest problems are made waaay bigger by AWFUL service.  love the place and the food was ... yea ok... but the place was quarter full... tons of empty tables and man we had to get up and ask for stuff from anybody we could find.   not going to review the food because at least for us... if the service isn't there... we'll pass.   Hope you all have better luck.
2129	0	a	This place is the worst customer service check out ever! It is  12:00pm Sunday and you only have two people ringing? Ok I'll give you maybe people call in sick. Me and 20 other people are in line waiting. Then your manager on duty is laughing and joking with another associate, as she gives her change. Noticing the line is getting longer you take your time laugh some more. With no one being helped nor being rung up. We are all still standing in line? Then after something is said both of you start to ring up again. With the manager still laughing. So sorry. I have been in retail for a long time totally unacceptable. I left my basket and the 300.00 worth of stuff I was going to buy there. The only good thing is the security officer, she welcomes you as you come in.
2130	0	a	We ordered very basic fried rice dishes. They're reasonably priced but very very bland. I'll give them another shot with other menu items but with the fail of this simple dish I won't know what to expect.
2131	0	a	"I don't normally review fast food places. Raising Cane's have been popping up around the valley and since I'm a sucker for chicken fingers, I decided to try them out. The menu is simple: chicken fingers, fries, Texas toast and coleslaw (and a chicken finger sandwich.) I got \""The Box\"" which included, 4 fingers, Canes sauce, fries, Texas toast, cole slaw and drink. When I got home and opened the lid, I immediately noticed the fingers were much much smaller than anticipated (about 3-4\"" long) The fingers  lacked flavor, were dry, and had way too much breading. The \""canes sauce\"" had flavor, but very salty. The Texas toast- well it was just a thick piece of bread, nothing special.  So next time I have a craving for chicken fingers, I will go to my old stand by: Culvers!"
2132	0	a	This place sucked. It was slow, they messed up our order and the people inside were rude. We went trying to get a FAST healthy lunch and ended up with a slow, gross smoothie. Over charged us by $2.00. It may be healthy but it's not worth the wait or the cost. $13 for two smoothies was ridiculous. Won't be coming back.
2133	1	a	I have been going to Genuine Fresche every week since they opened. My experience yesterday was AMAZING! They always go above and beyond to make sure everything is right. They even offered to get my dog a bowl of water. Thank you!
2134	0	a	I think it's ridiculously rude when a customer walks in & the person at the cash register is on their phone. This is exactly what happened when I walked in during lunch time today. After I had ordered, she went back to being on her phone after I had ordered too. Absolutely distasteful customer service.\n\nMy Chocolate Peanut Butter bowl came out quickly. I had asked for it to go, which in hindsight I wish I hadn't as it was not all that great ... especially not for almost $9! I was absolutely appalled. I've enjoyed many acai bowls in the past & this one didn't stack up anywhere close to them. The only things good in the bowl were the toppings. The fruit (strawberries & banana) were over-ripe but the granola, almonds, and honey tasted good. So really the way I see it, I paid $9 for a handful of granola, a sprinkle of almost, and a honey drizzle. Great. As far as the actual mixture goes, it had an odd taste, most likely because of the chocolate protein powder, and was way too liquid-y. I haven't ever had protein powder before and if this was a representation of what it tastes like then I will definitely be staying away. The mixture being too liquid-y was just a complete turn off.\n\nFor the amount of money & quality, I recommend not giving this place a try. I definitely won't be back.
2135	1	a	What a great place! Great environment, service and acai bowls!! I recommend this to anyone looking to fill their belly with something healthy.  Get the strawberry passion bowl! Yum!!
2136	1	a	Great smoothies, extensive choices, relaxing ambiance and sizeable portions at great prices.
2137	0	a	Bad Customer Service\nMe: I would like to buy a $6 smoothie with my groupon that is good for $10, will I be able to use the remaining $4 at a subsequent visit?\nEmployee #1: Yes, I think so.\nMe: Ok, thank you\nMe: My wife calls and asks me to buy something for her.\nMe: I get back in line and then ask a new employee if I can buy a $5 bowl and use the removing portion of my groupon.\nEmployee #2: That is not how it works, your groupon can only be used once. \nMe: If I had known that I would have used the whole $10\nEmployee #2: Sorry, would you still like the bowl.\nMe: No\n\nI am disappointed that they did not offer to at least take 3 dollars off a bowl on a subsequent on the next purchase when they knew what had just happened and I was given false information by employee #1.
2138	0	a	Came by for a berry smoothy. It was absolutely flavorless.  Had tried them in the past and we're good. Employee behind the counter seemed to not care about my dissatisfaction.  I then proceeded to leave and realized for the money I just spent I better get something that I enjoy. They ended up making a new one different flavor.  Will give them the benefit  of the doubt.  Yet customer service has to be forefront,  and not talking to your friends.
2139	0	a	This is convenient if you're staying at Delano, but its definitely not a place to trek to. \n\nI ordered a cheese panini and it was just okay. The sandwich was haphazardly put together. The bread was just decent and the cheese was just okay. The small side of tomato soup was good. \n\nThe fruit side had a chemical taste to it and I just couldn't eat most of it.
2140	1	a	Amazing food....great service..great vibe.\n\nI had the chicken club. It was very good....a good approach to a classic sandwich with French fries.\n\nI will definitely come back!
2141	0	a	I'm giving them a 1 star because of their price and service. The food is good but not worth the price. I respect the farm to table concept., but a  scrambled egg and bacon should not cost $18. One cup of black coffee should not cost over $5. We eat in a lot of amazing restaurants. But this place is over priced and over rated.\nLet's talk service...very cold and inattentive.  Never checked in us until I called the waitress over for a refill of my overpriced cofee, and when it was time to pay up. So our bill was over a hundred dollars for 2 kids and 2 adults. \nPlease spend you good money elsewhere.
2142	1	a	Had the croque madam after a very late night and it hit the spot.  Not too many places serve up croque madams, so when  I saw it on the menu I had to order it.  The sauce on top was to die for.  Service was good.  I will definitely want to eat here next time I am in Vegas.
2143	1	a	Great service. Healthy options. Juices and salads. Reasonably priced. The redesign with the Delano rebranding is more organic. The chunky old stodgy chairs were replaced by simply chic wooden ones. Farm to table vibe.
2144	1	a	Convenient if staying at Mandalay or delano \n\nOrdered the bucatini carbonara which was very rich and filling would recommend to split this dish\n\nMust try pumpkin pancake! Delicious!!!! \n\nAlso got omelet which was standard and good
2145	1	a	Just had an excellent meal here! We did lunch, everything was terrific. Some incredible. I started with the homemade Bloody Mary mix. Superb. Like everything, it obviously was made with fresh, natural ingredients. The breadbasket was hearty, with many good choices...excellent bread. I had an amazing burger. The entire burger was wonderful, including heirloom tomatoes (made a big difference)... the bacon on the burger was the best bacon I have ever had in my life. The ketchup with the top notch fries was also the best ketchup in my life. Others had a terrific kale and quinoa salad, and a wonderful grilled cheese. Can't wait to go back to breakfast. Oh! And while we were there, the chef came out and served everyone fresh juices he had just squeezed. Don't miss this if you are in then Mandalay Bay complex. Or close!
2146	1	a	"Bought a groupon to this little place so the wife and I decided to head over and check it out.  This place was AMAZING!!!  I got a \""this little piggy\"" burger, which was quite possibly the best burger I have ever had.  I will definitely be back."
2147	0	a	My wife and I were excited to see an new restaurant pop up where the old Teakwoods once was and were hopeful that it would really be a competitor to Penascos.  My overall review of Plaza Bonita is that it is painfully average and incredibly underwhelming.  This is nothing more than an standard run of the mill Mexican restaurant. That would not be a bad thing if they really nailed the food; which they didn't.\n\nThe first thing I noticed was that the chips and salsa that came out were sub par.  The chips were very thick and oily and the Salsa was completely liquid, no chunk of any kind save a few pieces of onion floating inside.  Mind you this was supposed to be garden salsa, which should be very chunky, not a chipotle that one would expect to be without chunk.  \n\nI ordered the Enchiladas Deluxe and when I asked if they could put Carne Asada inside instead of shredded beef.  I was told they had no Carne Asada, so I went with chicken...   Good thing I didn't go with my initial thought which was Carne Asada tacos.  When the plate arrived immediately I noticed that the refried beans were like puree so they were runny and I am fairly sure they were out of a can.  The rice was bland and again tasted like something seasoned with a pre-packaged seasoning mix.  The enchiladas were... enchiladas... but the tortillas were thick and spongy so they also didn't earn high marks.  \n\nEveryone else I was with had about the same impression with their meals.  The food wasn't terrible but it was just something you can get at any Mexican restaurant, both sit down and drive thru, and was not executed well.  I can go anywhere and get Mexican food so why would I choose to spend money at just another Mexican restaurant when I can choose Penascos, On the Border, Macayos, Blue Adobe Grill, etc?  All said in hindsight I would have rather taken my money to Fredricos and spent about 1/5 the price... Hell at least at Fredricos I know they are going to have Carne Asada.
2148	0	a	I'm not sure where to start. I guess I had my hopes up because there are few good places to sit down and enjoy a meal here in Maricopa. \n   We went during their soft open, they officially open tomorrow. So I truly hope that they are able to pull through and elevate their food.\n   The chips were bland and their salsa was little more than tomato sauce with a couple of chunks of onion. I ordered the Tres Amigos which had chile rellano, chile verde, and chile Colorado. The pork was tough, but the verde sauce was nice. The chile Colorado was bland and even though the beef was tender, it lacked flavor. The chile rellano was ok. I did feel that the breading was too thick, but thankfully the cheese was tasty.  The refried beans reminded me of baby food. Pureed beans thinned with a bit of water. The rice was mediocre at best. My husband ordered the chicken enchiladas. He was unimpressed. \n   Our server was prompt, but I seriously think he was high. Cocaine is a hell of a drug I hear.\n  The wall decor is fun, though the elk head leftover from when the space was Teakwood's was a bit odd. :)
2149	0	a	So my wife and I decided to grab something to eat and I want to say that the place it's really nicely laid out except the weird bulk head on the wall. The food was very mediocre at best and the service was so so.
2150	0	a	Terrible deep fried ice cream. Diet taco salad was pretty good. The fajita burrito on the menu neglects to warn you about the beans rice onions and peppers. My mother in law said it was OK but nothing spectacular. I might come back for a drink at the bar and for the Chips and salsa but for the food most likely not.
2151	0	a	Oh boy.\nThe first thing I noticed was that my menu was kind of gross. There was salsa squished inside of it. Yuck.\n\nSecondly, the plates were BURNING hot. You could not touch them, and they were so big that they didn't fit on the table and we had to burn our hands moving the plates to make room. That was only a small issue, although it did give us the impression that they were just putting the food on the plates and putting them in a microwave...\n\nThirdly, the food was not good. Rice was dry, shrimp was wayyyy overcooked and just overall, it was horrible. Not to mention that my plate was not cleaned properly whatsoever. The corn tortillas were also the kind you buy from the store. I have the same kind in my fridge. However, everyone lost their appetite officially once a customer behind us began to complain.\n\nThere was a huge hair wrapped in her food -- and it took a while for the waiter (who spoke no English) to give her another plate.\n\nWe complained as well about our food and my dirty plate, and he didn't understand anything, but thankfully he did understand to take it off of our check.\n\n(Also, I wanted to mention that the chips are simply taken out of some weird file cabinet-looking drawer and put a bowl... I could see them do that from where I was.)\n\nDon't go here. It's just not worth it.\n\nUPDATE: My sister and father both had gross diarrhea today -- my dad's started last night a couple hours after dinner. That does it, guys -- don't go. Don't risk food poisoning or upsetting your stomach in any way.
2152	0	a	Went there for the first time today and was not satisfied. Margaritas are the size of a kids drink and the food tasted pretty bad. Once again tried another Arizona Mexican restaurant and was disappointed.
2153	1	a	Just came back from eating here and I can honestly say that the rainbow roll was one of the best I ever had.  The service was very good as well.  This place is situated in a nice location where you can have your pick of a few nice restaurants.  Rock Lobster (fka The Sushi Room) is one of them.  Bf was with me and had the salmon.  By the look of his clean plate, he must have liked it.  Bf then ordered the chocolate lava cake, and although very rich tasting, bf didn't feel too heavy afterwards -- a definite plus for him and me!!:)
2154	0	a	"Changing one's name does not change the fact that the establishment still exists. I've experienced the WORST service with \""The Sushi Room\"" now Rock Lobster. I purchased a Groupon a few months back to eat sushi with my daughter and that is where the horrible service saga began.\n\nMaking reservations is an absolute joke! When I first purchased the Groupon, we made the reservation as required in the fine print. We arrived 15 mins early and sat outside. 15 mins later our drink orders were taken. Another 10, the drinks arrive and we order. We sat outside for 45 mins with NO food and no real service. The restaurant was NOT crowded! When I requested to cancel the order and pay for the drink I drank, I was told my food was almost ready. Not quite, I'm leaving! We were offered the food for free, but by this time I was quite upset because I was hungry and irritated. Stuck with the Groupon, I was forced to use it before it expired. Thanks for nothing Chase Bank!\n\nToday, I had my mother call and make a reservation for 5:30 pm and she was told they only had a 5:45 pm open. Upon arrival at 5:35 pm we were told that we had no reservation. Hmmm. Really?! Why is this the same girl who provided no service the last visit? And why does the sign on the wall state that Teppan ressy's start at 5 pm? Could the night get any worse? Hmmm, let's see:\n\n- With the addition of the Teppan, the waitress should ask whether or not a guest wants a regular or Teppan seat. Don't automatically walk me to a tray table (too small for 2 people). I made a reservation for the Teppan table that apparently NEVER made it to the book\n- You have happy hour, but I could only get HH drinks at the Teppanyaki table. Suggestion: Make a special \""Teppan HH Menu\"". This might serve your business well\n- No real Vodka or decent beer options; at least not for me. Absolute Vodka and Bud Light are low budget. Step up your game\n- While it is restaurant week, I had to request the RW menu. No bueno\n- We were told we could sit anywhere at the Teppan table however, should more people arrive we'd have to move down. Great! Right when my a$$ has warmed the seat. Though Benihana's has gone downhill, this place could learn something. Seat people correctly the first time. I'M NOT GETTING UP ONCE I'M COMFORTABLE!\n\nNOTE: I actually saw her ask a family with a disabled child to move once others arrived. Rude and unprofessional. The family was there first and shouldn't have been asked to move. If anything, the incoming family of six should've been sat at the Teppan table in the back.\n\n- The waitress barely came to inquire if we were ok or if we needed anything. And being the nice person I am, still left a tip. Shame on me.\n- And last but not least, when I showed her the Groupon she went to touch my phone. (Excuse me! You're in my personal space and attempting to touch my personal property! No bueno!) I will mark the Groupon as redeemed. Don't ever touch a customer's phone. \n\nBUYER BEWARE! NEW NAME SAME OWNERS (APPARENTLY) AND SAME WAITRESSES, WHICH IS HARD TO TELL WITHOUT THE CHANGE IN SERVER ATTIRE (FROM BOOTY SHORTS TO BLACK PANTS AND A BLACK UNIFORM T-SHIRT)....THE ONLY THING THIS PLACE DID RIGHT. NEVER AGAIN!"
2155	1	a	"Love the makeover! Restaurant is extremely clean, decor is well executed, and staff is not only fun and friendly but also professional (which is hard to find). Teppan chefs are hilarious and I most certainly award the \""dinnertainment\"" with five stars. I tired the fillet and scallop combo and it was top notch."
2156	0	a	Me giving one star is gracious. My roommate and I went here tonight. I have been to this restaurant when it was just the sushi room and loved it! However tonight was different. I made a reservation for 630, the hostess asked us to sit at the bar while they prepared the table,and then sat 12 other people at the table before she remembered the two of us. When we sat down we ordered, the waitress took forever to bring the soup which was Luke warm at best and tasted like soapy dish water. The salad didn't come until the chef started making our food. This was good. But as everyone was receiving their fried rice and steamed rice,my roommate and I noticed we had not gotten our steamed rice. We had to ask another waiter for rice.\nI had new York steak and shrimp. My roomie had chicken and filet mignon. My steak was over cooked I asked for medium rare. Her chicken as well was over cooked. Neither were seasoned barely at all. The shrimp was good tho. Unfortunately after I saw the owner ask a table full of people who were done eating and chatting if they could please move because while they appreciate their business there were people waiting. I knew my complaints would be irrelevant.\nNeedless to say I'm disappointed in the food, the service, all of it. And will never go back for tempanyaki. They have alot of kinks to work out.
2157	0	a	"Yuck! Specialty rolls were definitely nothing special. Tasted like a packaged California roll you buy in a grocery store. The $9 short ribs were cold and super salty. When I told the waiter all he said was \""sorry\"" and walked off. Maybe the Teppanyaki is better but if you want sushi or hand rolls drive east 10 minutes to Otaku!"
2158	1	a	Went here last night. They have a deal, if you make a reservation for 5:00 all the teppanyaki meals are half price (YES ALL OF THEM!!!) So of course I got the $48 combination. It starts out with a soup (not miso) so if you're expecting it, don't.(they do have miso which I would order instead).  They you get a nice chilled salad with ginger dressing. You can order they fried rice for extra or get the white rice \n\nSo now the main course. Appatizer shrimp, large lobster tail, filet mignon, scallops and mixed veggies. It was amazing. All for $24. I can't believe it. I know your asking yourself, how is the quality.... great!!!\n\nI would deffinetly be back. \n\nWhat a Dimond in the rough. Check it out.
2159	0	a	We had been craving Teppanyaki and wanted to check this place out so we went for their power hour. They have two griddles in the center of the restaurant when you first walk in, but they were only going to be having one 'show' that night. They decided they could squeeze us in and sat us in front of the griddle that was not going to be used. ) The whole table had 22 seats, and all but 5 were occupied so it was disappointing that they didn't have both griddles going. It also made the dinner service extra slow since one guy was cooking so much. \nI am allergic to shrimp, and usually the places we go to are willing to do the shrimp last or at least off to the side. ( I only ever get the veggies and tofu and its usually done well before anything else.) This place was not accommodating though-- which is fine since they were so busy-- so I just popped some benadryl and assumed that they would at least keep the stuff separate. The chef happened to put the shrimp directly touching the tofu I had ordered, which was a little annoying, there wasn't a shortage of space on the griddle at all as he hadn't started any of the other meats until after dishing out the veggies. Luckily the tofu was the worst tofu I have ever tried so i didn't even want to eat it.  It was extremely soggy and very very sugary.  My boyfriend spit out the bite that he tried as well. He had ordered the chicken and Filet for his entree, the chicken was doused in the same nasty sugar sauce that was on the tofu. The filet was very tender  though and between the two of us we did eat the whole portion of that. \nThe fried rice was also good, but didn't taste anything like normal fried rice, we couldn't figure out what the taste was. \nThe mushroom soup was okay, each bowl only had 2 impressively thin slices of mushroom in them. \nThe prices were fair with it being their power hour ( meaning half off all teppanyaki entrees) So is wasn't such a big deal that the food wasn't good and the portions were so small.\nAlso, they do not have a sign saying 'rock lobster' from the street. We drove by the place twice before just driving into the complex to see if we could find it. They do have a sign, it is just facing the parking area and a dirt lot. \nWe will not be returning.
2160	1	a	I had visited Rock Lobster when it was named the Sushi Room--I'm happy to say it is just as good as I remembered, actually better than I remember! They've added teppanyaki tables so we decided to give it a shot. The chef was amazing, the food was fantastic, the fried rice was delicious (it tasted fresh and smelled as good as it taste.) An added plus was that we were sat near a couple of friendly people that we made friends with.  \n\nWill definitely be back.
2161	1	a	Delicious!  Edemame, chicken rolls, Poppin roll, sunshine roll and california roll.  Beautifully made, service was excellent.
2162	1	a	The Poppin rolls were AWESOME! This place is way better than The Sushi Room, I think it is re-invented, but, they did it....so much better.  I highly recommend.
2163	1	a	Pleasantly surprised with this place! The vine/decor and service were great. My husband and I went on a Sunday for lunch (which happened to be happy hour all day!!) and got chicken eggrolls, 3 sushi rolls, and a sapporo for $22....and it was fresh and delicious. We will be back!
2164	1	a	Excellent lunch with three others, today. Very good chicken katsu... very crisp, not at all oily, moist chicken breast. The sushi lunch #1 had good sized portions of shrimp, tuna, and salmon nigiri, with an excellent California roll. The chicken teriyaki had moist grilled chicken in a tangy teriyaki sauce. The mochi with green tea ice cream (green tea ice cream in a mochi ball) was a hit, too!\n\nVery quick and professional service on a quiet lunch hour. Recommended!
2165	0	a	Portions too small.  My husband and I both got quiche.  My husband went home and ate breakfast again.  Service was terrible refill on coffee came almost at end of meal.  There was no dressing on salad we couldn't ask server because she never came back to table.  We had to get up to get the bill.  The only thing good was the view.
2166	0	a	My wife, her parents and I ate at the Statehouse restaurant for the first time Saturday, Oct. 11, and we were very disappointed.  Although the food--the walleye, scallops, beat salad, pasta dish--was good to above-average, it was not on a par with several other of the better restaurants in Madison.  \n\nMore disappointing was that my mother-in-law had made the reservation indicating it was a special dinner for her 62d anniversary and specifically asked for and was assured a table by the windows. Well, of course, the ma\u00eetre-d refused to honor that request even though two tables sat empty during our entire meal!  Our waiter was very personable and competent but no one offered us a wine list until we asked for it twice.  \n\nIt may be unfair to compare the new with the old Edgewater, but we always thought the old Edgewater had a unique panache in that it served steak diane and Caesar salad at tableside and had a number of other very nice touches that made it a destination for many special occasions.  Not a whole lot is unique about the Statehouse.
2167	0	a	I've been to the Edgewater twice now for food/drinks, and, living on Langdon Street, I want to give the place the benefit of the doubt because having such a beautiful restaurant/facility practically next door is exciting. And yet, both times I have been underwhelmed. \n\nThe service is very formal, which may be a good thing depending on your taste, but from my perspective, tends of come off as stiff and just a little bit classist.\n\nMore importantly, the food is nothing but a let-down. Madison is a foodie paradise. With destination restaurants such as L'Etoile, innovative gastropubs like Merchant, and local ingredients galore, the Statehouse cannot expect to compete if it continues on its current path. My bother and I ordered the duck confit poutine ($10). The fries were clearly frozen, the duck was dry, and the cheese seemed extremely processed. There was also a small (imperceptible until it was in my mouth) bone left in the duck meat. My brother ordered the bourbon burger ($12)--although we're 95% sure he received the bacon cheeseburger instead--medium rare, and received a dry, overcooked (no pink to be found in that patty) basic bacon cheeseburger. I, not having high hopes, ordered the grilled cheese sandwich ($9) which was actually very tasty but, come on, how do you screw that one up? \n\nAll in all, other reviewers are right on the nose when they say that the Edgewater and Statehouse are beautiful, but the service is stiff and still working out some kinks and the food is mediocre at best, and certainly not worth the price, even if you factor in the ambiance. I have high hopes that the Statehouse will work through these growing pains and begin to invest in high quality ingredients and attention to detail. If not, the restaurant will not survive in the Madison dining community.
2168	0	a	An utter disaster. \nValet only parking no valet parkers\nNo choice of seating in a near empty restaurant\nDarkened room midday \nHad to request wine list \nOne order of a walleye plate morphed into the delivery of a fish sandwich which wasn't even on the menu \nThe salt shaker top was loose so it all poured on my meal \nFrench fries cold and soggy \nNever offered desert \nTook 4 people to validate parking \nThe place is a mess
2169	0	a	"Just a disaster. \n\nWe walked in on a Friday afternoon to make reservations. They told me that for a party of 2, as in only 2 people, the only open reservations they had was for 6:00PM and 9:00PM. I Asked if they had a 5:00PM slot, and they said no. We were excited that it seemed so packed (so it must be popular!) and picked the 6:00PM slot.\n\nShowing up at 6:00PM on a Saturday, we found the place to be a complete ghost town. We were literally the ONLY people in the restaurant. No, I'm not saying \""Yea there were a couple of other tables filled but it was overall pretty empty\"". I'm saying \""There was not another seated table in the entire restaurant except for us.\"" Clearly not as popular as they thought they were in their heads (but their ego only expands from there).\n\nThe ambiance is beautiful, and the restaurant itself is presented quite well. Kudos to the construction and design crew. The design however is where the favorable parts about this restaurant end. \n\nOur waiter was decent. He knew most of the menu, was able to give us a basic description of the wine (though flubbed on telling us the location of most of them). No personal stuff, no chit chat. There was a very clear line between who he was (somebody there to make us pay for a service) versus who he wasn't (there to help us enjoy our meal to the fullest). \n\nThe food is ridiculously overpriced. Their cheapest entree's are around $30 and for a decent steak expect to pay upwards of $60+. That's for a SINGLE ENTREE. Want a side with that? Expect to pay $6 each for watery mashed potatoes or soggy asparagus. I was incredibly underwhelmed by the food. In no way was this a $150 dinner for two. I could have gotten a better meal down at the square for a third of the cost, easily. \n\nIt seems that the Statehouse thinks that it is the only classy and decent food serving place in all of Madison, and can thus charge you an arm and a leg for a basic meal. NEWSFLASH: THIS IS MADISON! This place is a foodie's dream and far far better food exists just a block or two away. Save yourself the massive pocket book write-off and go to a place where you will actually get quality food.\n\nOverall, I felt like the entire time the Statehouse was attempting to tell me that it was better than me. If this place was decently priced, I might actually return and recommend it just based off of it's ambiance and location. The adequate service and overpriced food forces me to not recommend this restaurant to anyone except those who wish to waste their money."
2170	0	a	We went for a brunch buffet on a Sunday morning. The atmosphere was nice with a fantastic view of lake mendota. The food was very good, great selection at the buffer and great quality. The pastries were excellent, as was the French toast and sausage. However, the service was very poor. Might be in part to them being fairly new, but some things were inexcusable. The staff never picked up our used plates, there was just a big stack on our table. We also had to ask repeatedly to get coffee refills and the omelette bar was all over the place. They served us the incorrect omelette on one occasion and underdone omelettes on two others. The waitress we had was only mildly attentive and seemed overwhelmed though they weren't terribly busy. Would like to go back for the food but if the service doesn't improve we won't be back.
2171	0	a	Went to lunch at the Statehouse in early December. I ordered one of the only vegetarian dishes on the menu, a beet, red rice, and bean burger w/ vegan cheese and a whole-grain bun. The beets in the burger were very flavorful but no seasoning was detectable, it was very dry, and it the ingredients seemed over-combined to the point of making the burger mushy. Overall it is not an impressive veggie burger and is in desperate need of some seasoning, texture, and sauce. Graze has a much more flavorful beet burger. The cheese curds we ordered, on the other hand, were delicious and not too greasy. The Basil Gimlet cocktail is super refreshing. The furnishings in the restaurant are a little awkward for the room, but the view of the lake on a good-weather day is stunning and the open-kitchen is gorgeous. I would go back for cocktails and apps on a sunny day, though not again for lunch.
2172	0	a	"It was our first outing to this newly renovated hotel and the Statehouse bar. We didn't dine there, although we intended to order some bar appetizers. Overall, the experience was just awkward.\n\n- The bar table we chose had been wiped down with a sour rag, so it smelled awful. Awkward.\n\n- We asked if we could sit in a different area. \""Yes, but you can't have drinks out there.\"" Awkward.\n\n- We found a spot to sit, but had to flag down a bartender/server to take our order. Awkward.\n\n- With a group of four, we were given just one bar menu. We asked for another menu but were told there was a shortage. Awkward.\n\n- The drinks arrived and the server promptly left. We were considering ordering some food, but we weren't going to flag down help yet again. Awkward.\n\n- All four of our drinks sat empty for about 10 minutes before anyone checked on us. Awkward.\n\n- To accompany the second round of drinks, we asked for ice water which was delivered about 15 minutes after the drinks arrived. Awkward.\n\n- We asked the front desk about validating our parking and was told, \""No, you can just pay on the way out.\"" Awkward.\n\nGiven the Edgewater's longstanding \""meh\"" reputation in Madison, its stumbles out of the gate after the renovation and its apparent lackadaisical attitude toward service, training and effective management, it's going to be a tough road. There are so many better options."
2173	1	a	My family just had an elegant holiday dinner at The Statehouse at The Edgewater after an hour of skating on their Plaza.  There were 11 of us and we plan to make it a tradition every year when the kids come home for Christmas.  The food, service and wonderful atmosphere were all superb.\n\nGary Stebnitz
2174	0	a	Was anxious to try the Edgewater after its renovations and reopening.  Went twice -- once with friends for dinner and another time to show my visiting relative the new buildings.  \nThe Statehouse is beautiful and the Edgewater is still a wonderful location.  Food was OK, not really special.  Had the walleye pike.  \nService was very nice but very inept.  Our waitress was covering for the bartender as well and knew nothing about making drinks.  She served a glass a prosecco in a large wine glass instead of a champagne flute.  \nat the bar the next night, I asked the same waitress for an Irish Coffee on a very cold night and was served whiskey and lukewarm coffee in a glass; no whipped cream at all, none offered.  My wife ordered a Sambuca.  It arrived over ice (supposed to be served neat with a couple of coffee beans as a garnish; flamb\u00e9e optional).  These things could be fixed with a little training or even by consulting a bartender's guide for one brief second before serving.  \nI sure hope that they invest some time and money into staff training to get the service level to rise to the level of the setting.
2175	0	a	"My family and I made a reservation for eight and ate off of the diner menu.  The atmosphere was great and the seating was very comfortable, although elbow around the table could have been better.  The food was OK, not great.  I had the KC steak which I ordered medium rare but it came back medium.  My wife ordered the same and hers was cooked perfectly.  Overall, I'd say the steak was comparable to Outback Steakhouse but at more than twice the price.  The steak wasn't a bad cut, it just didn't have any real flavor.  I recommend visiting the Tornado Room for a high quality steak that's actually worth the price.  We had several appetizers.  The crab cakes were good.  The \""sweet bread\"" wasn't bad.  Understand that this is a meat dish though, and from what I understand, it's cow thyroid.  Again it wasn't bad, but I certainly wouldn't order it again.  The highlight of the menu were the several desserts.  The cheesecake, baked in-house pie, and chocolate cake were all very good.  I'm willing to try this restaurant again, maybe for the breakfast menu, but currently, this restaurant isn't worth the high price point.  If you are staying at the Edgewater, get a cab and try out any of downtown Madison's better restaurants.  You'll spend less and have a better dining experience."
2176	0	a	I stayed at te Palms resort and was excited try the new resturant... Walk by it late one night and ask if they were open, girl up front said yes for a soft opening and not a full menu, great a new place to try intro by the eater. It is now 9/8 1 pm and said told to try again at 5? Seriously I mean come on,you opened at 11 am and your closed at 1pm in the afternoon. GOODLUCK with that kind of soft opening and service!!!! Hope do dont close up shop and head back to Chicago, eater LV was all wrong all hype. I can PASS on this place
2177	0	a	Have you ever watched MasterChef/Hell's Kitchen and wondered....what is it like being those diners who sit and wait for 1.5+ hrs for their food???\n\nWell, my party and I had THAT experience tonight at Lao Sze Chuan. It was opening night for them, and I guess it was busy and kitchen didn't know how to handle it? We waited almost 2 hours for our food to come to the table. After sitting for 1 hour and 20 mins, we approached the manager to ask about why our food hadn't come, and let them know that we were going to leave. We had made a reservation at 7pm, and at that point, it was 8:25pm, and all we had on our table was water/drinks and the house special spicy cabbage. WE WERE SO HUNGRY!!!\n\nBut I will say that management was very professional, and offered to comp us our meal, and invited us to come again. We finally started getting our food close to 9pm, and if you like spicy sze chuan food, it is really quite good. The flavor is there, and the ingredients are of good quality. They just gotta get their kitchen in check. And figure out which tables to bring the food to (yes, at one point, food was brought to our table and then taken away because it was supposed to be for another table! sadness....)\n\nDecor is lovely. Chairs are super comfy.  And definitely order the dry chili chicken :)
2178	1	a	Tradition. \nComfort.\nValue.\n\nThese words best describe our dining experience at Lao Sze Chuan on opening night. The value here was surprising! Every dish we sampled was priced very reasonably, if not competitive. The dishes we tried were served in the perfect sized portions to share between 2-4. My boyfriend and I actually took home 2 bags of leftovers by the end of the evening. \n\nRight away, I immediately noted the modest presentation and culinary style of master chef Tony Hu. It's a breath of fresh air to not be confronted with nibbles of expensive, weak and flavorless rabbit food. It's also important for me to note that the chef is not reinventing the wheel, he's just putting his spin on classical Szechuan dishes - fine tuning it to his culinary expertise.\n\nWe received top-notch service from start to finish. Every member of their well trained staff made us feel extra cared for. We were curious about one of the dishes we tried and one server took his time to explain to us, in detail, about the Szechuan chili and how different chilies cause different effects to the palate. He was articulate and eager to share his knowledge of the cuisine. \n\nI'll also quickly note that the ambiance was classy and blanketed in a swanky, modern pan asian decor - but that's what we all come to expect from a Vegas casino restaurant. Let me just put this out there - dress code is not strictly enforced. \n\n\nHere's what we tried:\n\n//Cold spicy cabbage// complimentary \nThe cold, crisp cabbage had a medium spice that tickled our nostrils and tastebuds. We enjoyed the spicy, slightly sweet and addicting crunchy texture so much that we immediately ordered a second round. *pro tip: as addicting as they are, wait to eat them with your dinner! This paired very well with the rice and the rest of our dishes. 5/5\n\n//Chongquin chili oil wontons// (6 wontons) $5.95\nWe savored the expert layering of sweet, spicy flavor and also admired the striking ginger flavor infused into the chili oil. The Szechuan chili peppers pleasantly tingled and numbed my entire mouth, making it such a unique dining sensation. I only had 2 minor annoyances: the wonton wrappers were not as luscious and soft as I would prefer; they were actually hard and a bit undercooked. The same could be said about the wonton filling; a little lackluster and dry. However, the winning aspect of the entire dish was the sensational and flavorful numbing chili oil sauce. *pro tip: make sure to save the remaining chili oil and pour it over your rice! 4/5\n\n//Sliced tender cold pork marinated in garlic sauce and chili oil// $6.95\nThis dish was presented exactly how we expected - glistening ribbons of cold, thinly sliced pork. The pork ribbons were buttery soft and marinated in a mouthwatering garlicky chili oil flavor - but the dish is not at all oily. Keep in mind, this dish is not saucy and had mild spice. 5/5\n\n//Lamb with pure cumin// $15.95\nA dry (not saucy), stir-fried dish with a gorgeous deep brown color, red and green bell peppers, whole Szechuan chili peppers (not spicy in the slightest, but great smoky flavor), jalape\u00f1o slices (not spicy at all), garlic, and onion. Pure cumin is the precise way to describe the overall flavor of this dish. The lamb was generously coated in the warm cumin spice and was extremely bold and aromatic. However I can't emphasize it enough, this dish was lacking spiciness altogether. Also, I personally thought the lamb was a bit too chewy and tough, yet my boyfriend felt that the lamb was expertly prepared and was as tender as it will ever be - two different preferences and views on an arguably tasty dish. In the end, this fact remains - the lovely cumin spice complimented the gamey nature of the lamb very well. 4/5\n*edit: just had the most divine (leftover) lunch! The lamb marinated even longer with the intense, flavorful cumin seasonings, making it 100% more tender and flavorful. These are a solid 5/5 now! \n\n//Eggplant in garlic sauce// $11.95 \nA traditional dish with familiar flavors. However, it was a sultry celebration of a classic dish, namely because they selected the most perfectly ripe, plump eggplants and gently cooked them in effort to retain their lovely firm texture and to keep their beautiful shape. They were insanely juicy, sweet and buttery. Also, the sauce was super silky, swimming with an abundance of wood ear mushrooms and crisp pickled cucumber. I couldn't stop eating it, even well after I claimed I was full. 5/5\n\nAll minor issues aside, my boyfriend and I absolutely enjoyed our dining experience here; our dinner was satisfying and comforting. We are looking forward to returning soon, in hopes that the small setbacks we encountered were just a case of the opening day jitters. \n\nI applaud master chef Tony Hu and his World-class staff and wish them continued success.\n\nPro tip: Grand opening 25% off your entire bill with the discount card that can be obtained at the hostess desk. Expires 10/15.
2179	0	a	It's awful. We sat there for 20 mins but no one came and took our drink order or greeted us, so I had to ask for water... After we ordered we waited for like 30 mins to get our first hot dish, and then someone told us that they ran out of fish and cabbage so we needed to changed our other order...\n\nThe food was salty and overcooked. I believe I can do better than that. Just don't go.
2180	0	a	Got a comp so decided to go this restaurant for lunch. The service was substandard. We order a har gow, sticky rice dim sum and chow fun and some snow pea leaves. Hot and sour soup came out cold.  All was below average. You can get better food in Chinatown.  Definitely won't come back.
2181	0	a	My soup came cold and too much starch in the hot and sour soup. Food was below chop suey quality. Order tenderloin chow fun but got overly tenderized beef instead.
2182	0	a	Came here with some friends and family member to try out this new place. Service was extremely horrible. Menu was only brought to us after sitting at the table for 10 minutes and we had to ask for it. Our drinks was not even refill once and server did not even bother to check on us. Food was alright,  nothing special. I wouldn't come here again.
2183	1	a	This restaurant is a hidden gem inside  PALMS with great service from the door to wait staff to food & beverage selection. My personal favorite was the green bean spicy black bean appetizer. All the textures of the tofu, chicken, beef, & shrimp dishes were just right with very delicious sauces. The ambiance was relaxing and spacious for large groups to enjoy a meal together. I would bring business partners, friends, and my family there many times. Very happy.
2184	0	a	I had high hopes for Lao Sze Chuan because it originated in Chicago an outstanding food city. \n\nI sampled both traditional Szechuan dishes and dishes found in every Americanized Chinese restaurant across the country.\n\nShanghai egg rolls- rolls did not taste freshly made and tasted like egg rolls you can get in the frozen section of any grocery store\n\nDon don noodles- my favorite dish of the night even though it was overly salted \n\nSpicy beef tendon- full of oil \n\nFish with black bean sauce- fish was cooked well but once again tasted Americanized \n\nEgg fried rice- DRY\n\nEven with 25% off, I will not be back due to the food being full of oil and it tasting Americanized.
2185	1	a	This was hands down one of my fave spots back in Chicago, I was so excited when I heard they were opening here in Vegas. Ate here last week and can't wait to go back! amazing!
2186	1	a	We went there for dinner. It is good that they close at midnight as a lot of time we have dinner after 10pm but don't wanna eat in China Town. We like the environment of the restaurant, the food, and the service. The price is acceptable, cheaper than the Chinese restaurants in other hotels on the strip. \n\nWe ordered a Mongolian beef, beef fried noodle and sauteed baby bak choy. They all tasted great. The Mongolian beef is really better than any other Mongolian beef I had tasted else where. The seasoning profile of this one has more depth than those using too much black pepper, garlic and soya sauce. The Mongolian beef here is really outstanding, it tasted so good without having anything overpowering, well balanced.\n\nThe sauteed baby bak choy is well done, the veggie is just right, not under or overcooked. It is not garlicy as we asked for simple sauteed, so it is simply refreshing. The baby bak  choy is fresh, and good quality, they are well cleaned too so no sandy taste when chewing on them. They smartly cut the baby bak  choy into quarters vertically so they could be thoroughly cleaned.\n\nThe beef fried noodle is good, just no surprise, which is expected. I like that they don't use the very thin yellow noodle. \n\nWe were offered a small complimentary spicy veggie plate as appetizer. It smelled really good but too spicy for us that we kept coughing. If you can handle picy, you will like it. \n\nI like Chinese food having the real Chinese flavor, meaning that I always compared it with what I had tasted when I was in northern China for an exchange program. I like food having depth but not overpowering by only black pepper or garlic That means I don't like americanized Chinese food. So far, with the 3 dishes that I tried, they tasted Chinese without Americanization. There was also no MSG. I hate MSG. I always think that only those chefs who can't cook well need to use MSG. So big kudo for here not using any. I hope they won't change on this aspect in the future. I can't speak for other dishes yet, but will update in the future after I tried something new there. \nWe finished everything we ordered and had a happily filled stomachs at the end. We will come back to try other dishes for sure!
2187	1	a	This recently opened restaurant is located in the space formerly occupied by Little Buddah.  The room is now more open and brighter than in the past.   A spicy cabbage salad was delivered to our table while we reviewed the menu.  We started off with shrimp spring rolls that were light and tasty.  For entrees we chose sole filets in a fresh black bean sauce plus the chef's special chili chicken.  \n\nThere was an exceptionally long delay between courses so our waitress brought us a second dish of cabbage salad and eventually comped us desserts.  The chicken dish was a crunchy delight though not nearly as spicy as one would believe given the quantity of red chili on the plate.  The sole was tender and equally delicious.  Prices are moderate for a casino restaurant and entrees are generously portioned.\n\nOur individual cheesecakes, though hardly Asian, almost brought one senior to tears. On entering I had secured a grand opening card from the hostess that was good for 25% off menu prices through October 15th.
2188	1	a	I typically do not eat Szechuan food because this cuisine tends to be too spicy and greasy for me; but when I do (because of friends & family), my choice is Lao Sze Chuan.  Welcome to Las Vegas, Chef Tony!  It's good to dine at your restaurants in Chicago and it's great to have you here in Vegas!  My favorite is Tony's chicken with 3 chili!  Love the fact that the prices are GREAT, especially in a casino!
2189	0	a	"Probably the worst place to get hot pot. We had about 10 ppl in our group and the reservation and everything went good all the way up till the service. My waiter probably needed to be trained again on customer service. I literally am consistently looking for him for a refill or for my orders ! There was a period where I waited over 30 mins to get an Order I had for some meat and veggies. The worst part was that I had spoke to two other ppl to check my order before my waiter came over and finally realized he lost my order !!!! After 30+ mins and no food we were starving !!!! The proportions were not good as they barely gave the bare minimum to serve everyone. I know there is limitations so that ppl do not waste food but we didn't even have enough to share ! Not to mention my waiter told literally told me \""it's troublesome for ME and for you when we do hotspot.\"" Um excuse me ? IM PAYING FOR THIS!!!!!!!!! Honestly there was nothing special about this place or it's food and probably the worst customer service. Oh and the manager lounges around doing practically nothing. Never coming to this place again."
2190	0	a	"Our experience here was awkward, uncomfortable, and overall unpleasurable. There was a group of 7 of us in town on business.  We are all on our own expense account so we need to pay separately.  The waitress was snotty, and pissed that we needed to split the check.  She did back down a bit and agreed to only split the check a maximum of 6 ways.  She wasn't busy, we were there when there were only a few other tables.  She just didn't want to spend the effort to accomodate.  \n\nI'm hoping that something was getting lost in translation, because some of her comments and responses to us were just downright rude.  For example, when a couple of people in the party had questions about the selections she kept responding in a rude tone with the phrase \""I'm waiting to take your order\"".  \n\nMaybe the poor service set the tone and skewed my expectations, but the meal that followed wasn't all that great.  \n\nTwo of my peers chose egg rolls for an appetizer.  They were clearly served spring rolls (both are offered on the menu).  When we inquired with one of the table attendants if we got the right thing, the answer was something to the effect of \""americans don't know what egg rolls are\""... the busser came by and said he'd take the rolls back and correct the order, but the pissy server came over, insisted that we were provide the correct dish, and her disdain for us continued to grow.  \n\nLady, I know the difference between a spring roll and egg roll. \n\nThe large table was adorned with a huge lazy susan in the middle, which made it very easy to share each dish with each other.  The seafood fried rice was good.  The crispy duck was dry, it was either overcooked, or cooked in advance and reheated.  The Szechuan dumplings were spicy but good.  The steamed dumplings were just average.  The dry chili tofu had plenty of flavor, but the tofu itself was dry and again seemed to be way overcooked. \n\nOverall, the dishes all seemed to be overcooked, oversalted or MSG'd, or over-oiled.  \n\nThis was one of the worst dining experiences in the past few years.  The piss poor attidue paired with sub-par food left us wondering if we were in some kind of hidden camera show.  I think that if any of us were not dining with our work colleagues we'd have either responded more aggresively to how we were treated, or would have walked out all together.  It's sad, because the menu items seemed interesting and the space is beautiful."
2191	1	a	Amazing 50 minute massage by Maria! If she lived by me, I would get a massage once a week from here. I felt so tense and anxious before going in and walked out on clouds! She added some fabulous peppermint oil to my neck wrap that was unbelievable! I even bought it! Outstanding experience! Thank you!
2192	0	a	"Massage was great however my massage therapist had a cough which was kinda killing my zin. They did incorporate a scent and orchids into the experience which was a nice treat. \n\nI've gone to several of the spas in Vegas and I have to say the one at SLS is a total ripe off! The facility only has a steam room and a \""lounge\"". No jacuzzi. No sauna. Nothing fancy. They have water and tea no snacks.\n\nThe entire place is covered with white curtains so it reminded me of a sterile hospital. Good if you want complete privacy. \n\nThe shower was AMAZING! I loved the jets-it was like an added massage ad the staff is very kind and patient."
2193	1	a	Such a beautiful intimate spa! The entire staff was amazing and so friendly. Love the plush robes!\nI had the best massage from Cynthia and I loved the warm neck wrap and back pad and the option to add a scent to my massage which I chose Mandarin. \nMy husband had a facial from Nicole and he said it was the best facial he has ever had. And he is very picky with his facials! \nBest thing about the SLS is this spa! Ok maybe the food too. We will be back for sure!
2194	1	a	A very small spa and salon facility, shared the same spaces with the gym.\n\nWe booked couple massage service, they called us the last minute saying they didn't have couple room available, I was looking forward to taking a treatment bath in one of those couple rooms, there was no bathtub in our suite! I got upset of course, then they offered free facial for both of us to make up for the couple room thing, I guess that would do for me.  \n\nThe spa is just located on the second floor of Lux tower where we stayed at, very convenient for us. Got there after lunch, it was all white with pink orchid flowers here and there. Very neat and unique design, exactly Starck style, all whites with popped out pinks. \n\nWomen get to choose what kind of fragrance to use at the treatments, I chose Oolong, it was very soothing and calming. After changing into a robe, I followed my host to the common waiting area, there were tents, yes you heard me right! There were a lot of waiting tents! The one we were in had two small sofas with an end table in the middle, it's for couples obviously. This design is very unique and interesting, but not very practical, people get lost, all the tents looked exactly the same! I had to call out hubby's name after my restroom trip because I couldn't remember which tent I was in, and I couldn't get to the ladies room without a guide, hubby had the same problem. Okay, just more work for spa staffs, tour guide is part of the job description for them I guess. \n\nDespite the beautiful but weird interior design, the treatments we received were world class! 50 minutes massage and 50 minutes facial for each of us. I had Ciel massage, my massage therapist was very gentle on me cause I said I was very ticklish, it was not too bad, I could handle it alright. My facial was amazing, I asked for eye treatment too cause my eyes were puffy and red from too much drinking the previous night, my facial specialist used little cold stones to massage upper and lower of my eyes, also used eye mask, the puffiness were gone after the treatment, it was magic! Hubby's deep tissue massage was great too, he needed it so bad. \n\nBoth of us enjoyed our treatments so much, we felt very relaxed after the spa trip, our faces were clean but so red from facials. \n\nThey have steam rooms, limited beverages and snacks, and... tents for guests to enjoy. Can't say I liked this facility too much, but the treatments were definitely one of the best we have ever received! \n\nPs. They use real keys for lockers. It was annoying to keep the key with me all the time.
2195	1	a	I have had Access at my house now three different times.  Two times to hang flat screen tv's on the wall and recently to fix a defective/ broken GFI switch.   They are always on time and professional and if you deal with Chris Church, he is the best, he always calls right back or texts you back right away.\n\nGreat service, reasonable prices.  Highly recommend Access Electric and ask for Chris when you can :) as he is so nice to deal with.
2196	0	a	If I could give this place no stars I would. Terrible pizza! Absolutely the worst pizza I have ever had. Frozen pizza is better. Their sauce is sugary. Their dough is obviously bought (sad cause it's so bad). Toppings were cheap. There are way better pizza within a mile or so (even Pizza Hut has better food). I don't see this place lasting longer then a month or two. Ordered for delivery, gave them a credit card. They had to call me 3 times to reenter the card, finally I said I'll just pay cash. Waste of money. Had to rebake the pizza and still ended up throwing 80%of it away.
2197	0	a	Don't come here if your looking for a quick slice. It took them over 30 mins to make 2 5in personal pizzas. Customer service was awful. Never going here again!
2198	1	a	"Surprising little pizza place. Super friendly staff. Two 16\"" deep dish pizzas done in 20 minutes and they were delicious. \n\nThe dough was not mushy or dry, it was very pleasant. The sauce had a nice blend of spices and it really made the pizza better. \n\nOverall I was kind of impressed. I didn't have high expectations for such a small place, but I'll definitely be there again."
2199	1	a	I ordered a deep dish pizza. It was hot and cheesy which to me is a win win. I read the other reviews and I just had to visit myself. I found the staff pleasant. They made it easy to order. Its nice having options in my area.
2200	0	a	Their website and phone message say they open at 10am on Friday, but I couldn't get through until 10:45am. Ordered a 12in deep dish with pepperoni and chicken that cost $17+tip! Pizza tastes like it was frozen. Couldn't even finish a slice without having to spit some out in the trash. Overpriced nasty pizza.
2201	1	a	Great pizza and great staff!!!! They always make you feel welcome when you walk in! Highly recommended! !!
2202	0	a	We noticed Asiatique Thai Bistro while in Bakery Square and thought we'd give it a try since we really like good Thai food.\n\nThe food was mediocre, the portions were small, and the prices were high. I'd be happy to forgive one of the three, but it's hard to like a place that fails on all of these. My Pad Thai, which I was requested to be spicy, was fairly bland, and the vegetables were tough. The flavor just wasn't right. I also tried the Pad Se Ew and Thai Fried Rice, which were similar. The ambiance was non-existent (hopefully, they'll eventually add some music or something). The people working were nice and fairly attentive, but that couldn't make up for the flavor, portions or prices.\n\nBottomline is that if you want Thai food, go to any of the places in nearby Squirrel Hill. If you're in Bakery Square and just want something to eat, go to Social where you can get some reasonable food and a beer for the same price as an entree at Asiatique.
2203	0	a	The lunch portion was way too small with tiny diced tofus. I couldnt believe how little noodle the dish had when it came out. The drunken noodle was just salty and not tasty. I wouldnt recommend paying $9-10 for this. The walnut street has multiple restaurants that offer more delicious and fresh lunch with cheaper prices.
2204	1	a	So I went to this place with some friends as we live really close by. When we arrived we were seated right away and presented with menus.\n\nAs I tend to be a little sensitive with spicy food, I asked the waitress about various dishes and their spiciness level and ended up ordering the pad thai with shrimp, which was quite tasty and had plenty of shrimp although it still had the tails . \nMy husband being the spice lover got the pumpkin curry with chicken, which came with some brown rice and per reports was really good. \n\nWe also ordered the spring rolls for the table and those were nice a crispy and were served with a tasty sweet sauce.  As we were finishing our dishes the owner came to our table to ensure that every one in our party was pleased, which was pretty nice. The wait staff was also very helpful in order to help me find a dish that I would like due to my lack of spice tolerance.\n\nOverall I enjoyed the experience and would return. Oh and BTW this place is BYOB.. so bonus for that!!
2205	1	a	I love the lunch buffet at Mirch Masala and I'm so glad that it has reopened.  My husband and I go to many Indian restaurants in madison and this particular restaurant/chef is our favorite.  I find that their ingredients are fresher and better than some other places nearby.  My particular favorites are their goat curry, veggie noodles, tandoori chicken, and their sweet naan (peshawari) .  What I think sets this place apart are the slight alterations the chef makes to the usual dishes.  For example the palak paneer has more than just spinach in it, I think the chef puts in some leek too which I find quite surprising and pleasant.  Sometimes there is a slight bbq sauce in the tandoori chicken which is awesome.  It isn't the same as other traditionally Indian restaurants, perhaps due to the Nepalese influence.  I really appreciate what this chef/owner is doing with the food.  He was originally the chef of many known establishments, but saved his money up to get a place of his own where he can cook the food he wants and I respect that and hope this restaurant does well in this hidden location.
2206	0	a	I wanted to love Mirch Masala.  I really did.  I tend to hate buffets as I love my food prepared to order.  In this case, the food actually had pretty good taste and flavor.  The problem?  Most of it was cold.  Not luke warm, but actually cold.  There were four of us and we all had the same complaint.\n\n This was the real downer of MM.  We were also well into their lunch service at about 12:30, so it wasn't like we marched in as they opened.  The service was pretty mediocre too.  If I go back, I'll order off the menu and skip the buffet.
2207	0	a	Was treated very Rude by the female manager , my daughter was even upset about how she was to me. Christie has also been rude at another location to me. I do not know her. Makes it not worth it!
2208	0	a	This location takes FOREVER! do not go here unless you want to sit in line for thirty minutes even when there are only three cars ahead of you. Ridiculous! Even the location by ASU (which is always flooded with people) is WAY faster
2209	1	a	Absolutely love this place! When we lived in south east we had Zaxby's. We miss eating there, but this place is so much like it. The sauce here is basically Zax sauce. The chicken is really juicy and I love the Texas toast. I went through the drive thru and they were super friendly and fast. We will be coming here again.
2210	1	a	This is the only Cane's I've been to. Loved it from the start. We live right down the road so it's way too convenient cuz I want it all the time. Lol. Best chicken, fries, Texas toast and Sauce EVER!! I love the restaurant inside too. Super busy and fast. Managers were nice and staff was on it!
2211	1	a	The best chicken!!! Love their sauce and toast, too! So glad they built one near my home I used to drive to the one on peoria and the I-17
2212	0	a	I watched the employee cleaning the tables then WITHOUT washing his hands he gets my food and brings it around.  Ewwww is all I thought. First time visit became my last
2213	0	a	"Food is bland, they cook slow, \""toast\"" is extremely soft and not good, fries not crispy, chicken not crispy, its just soggy and unseasoned"
2214	0	a	After hearing my daughter rave about it we decided to try it.  I sent the girls down with some money and waited for their return.  We opted for the six piece chicken tenders, cole slaw, and French bread basket.  \n\nChicken was good, especially dipped into their special sauce.  Cole slaw hit the spot and bread was also good but not great.  Fries lacked personality.\n\nOverall, nothing special but not bad either.  The menu is limited but I guess it works for them.
2215	1	a	First time eating A&W..... Simply amazingly fresh. The beef was real tender and juicy, it was actual meat. We ate the combo of 2burgers for 6$ made to a combo for about 10$, overall very good fast food. \nEstablishment was a bitndirty but didn't care too much for I was enjoying my meal.
2216	1	a	I can't say enough about how AMAZING Amey is! My baby is 4mos and I don't know where I'd be without having all of her help the past 4mos. I started off with having latch issues, she came to my house promptly upon our arrival home from the hospital and spent time answering all my questions and helping me breastfeed. She also gave me amazing recommendations such as a chiropractor that has helped drastically with my baby breastfeeding as well and was very knowledgeable on tongue ties and how to breastfeed after having the procedure done. Recently, my supply decreased and we had to supplement with formula and Amey was available to answer all of questions and give me a recommendation for a formula when my baby was allergic to everything else we had given him. She has been a lifesaver, SO responsive and sweet to this spastic first time mom. I HIGHLY recommend Amey and cannot wait to have more babies just so I can keep going to back to her!! Thank you Amey!
2217	1	a	We ate lunch here on a slow Saturday afternoon.  The food was outstanding - everything we had was very good.  We started with the jalape\u00f1o corn bread with the homemade pepper jelly and can highly recommend it. The gooey bluey got high marks and so did the apple cheddar melt. The real high point of the meal though was the roasted cauliflower soup, the homemade soup of the day. \n\nIf this was based on the food alone it would be a five star review but the area that needs improvement is the service. We saw the friendly owner at our table more often than the tie dye clad waiter who left our drinks empty for almost half the meal and did not check up on us. The owner did stop by a few times though so hopefully the service gets straightened out.\n\nIt is nice to have a more upscale pub in town.  We will definitely be going back soon.
2218	1	a	Had a great meal tonight with my husband! Service was excellent as well as the atmosphere and food. I had the pesto avocado griddled cheese with sweet potato fries and a siracha aioli. The griddled cheese was crisp on the outside and melt in your mouth on the inside; the aioli gave the fries just the right amount of kick. My husband had the gooey Louie and thorough enjoyed it. Highly recommend Willie Ty's!
2219	0	a	Found a little menu under my hotel room door so I ordered. ORDERED a large half supreme pizza and half Hawaiian pizza with 12 wings half hot and half BBQ. I got a large pizza that was all supreme with pineapple on it and it was a little cold. Pizza over all taste not bad. The wings were ALL hot with no meat and were tiny. Not good at all. Got one small ranch. When I ordered some airhead took my order and the guy delivering didn't have a uniform or a light up on his car, you would have no idea that he was the pizza guy. And there was a bunch of his buddies in the car. My pizza was in his trunk with a bunch of his crap. I'm from SoCal so idk if that's how they do it in Las Vegas but damn.
2220	0	a	Their chicken Philly was very unremarkable. Their chocolate cake was, however,  perhaps the best I've ever had.  Melted in my mouth.  Best $15.00 piece of cake ever!
2221	1	a	xl pick up pizza good deal. ghetto area\n wouldn't walk there at nite. Chick taking orders kinda rude. Expensive for delivery but pick up u get what u pay for.
2222	1	a	"Their pick-up specials can't be beat for the price. Is it the \""the best pizza I've ever had\""? No. But it's the best pizza I've ever had for THAT PRICE, for sure. Blows places like Little Caesar's out of the water (no comparison at all).\n\nI get the large 1-topping (and always add an topping), comes out to like a whopping $7.00 (sarcasm). Would be only like $6.00 without I think. I've heard their calzones are great too, but haven't tried them yet. Once I find something I like, for cheap I usually stick with it. My friend ordered a big thing of wings from them once, and I had a few, they were pretty good, but I prefer their pizzas. \n\nThe cheese they use is great, I don't know how they turn a profit at that price as all the ingredients are WAY better than what you'd find at places with similar prices. It's true, the area isn't that great (I live nearby) and it's small inside, but are you trying to rent a room there, or get some food?"
2223	1	a	I ordered from this restaurant using my GrubHub app which was so easy and convenient to use. This was my first time ordering from GrubHub and I have nothing but positive things to write. My food arrived as promised, within the allotted amount of time, hot and delicious. The delivery driver was courteous and the restaurant  followed my special instructions to a T. We ordered a pizza and a Philly cheese steak sandwich, both were very delicious. Thanks Roma's pizza and GrubHub. GrubHub must be an awesome place to work with wonderful employees.
2224	1	a	The Bacon Beer Cheese bread AMAZING! Quite literally my new food obsession. They partnered with Great Dane Brewery and you can really taste and smell the delicious beer flavor. Not sure what the yellow cheese is, but it's a hidden golden treasure! Also tried the peach blackberry bar and the fruit was super fresh and moist-Excellent again! The scones instead of crumbling and drying your mouth out, were flavorful, soft and fresh. Still have yet to try a few other breads and scones we got, but so far everything has been great! My recommendation would be to go to Great Harvest and enjoy!
2225	1	a	"Stopped in today after seeing several positive reviews. Totally agree with what's been said!\n\nWe had 2 great salads...a chicken salad and a ham/brie. Both were outstanding...the bread has good flavor/texture and each of the ingredients in the sandwiches came together to create a great flavor profile.\n\nSuper friendly staff handing out samples of a variety of products.\n\nBest part...they were running a \""buy a sandwich get a loaf of bread free\"" promo, so we left with 2 free loaves of bread! We sampled (and took) a loaf of the cinnamon chip...it was outstanding!\n\nThe sandwiches run around $7-8. They are decently sized, and the quality of the ingredients warrant the price. With a promo like we experienced today, we felt like we got a steal.\n\nOne thing to note...Great Harvest is closed on Sundays...we previously discovered this the hard (and sad) way :)"
2226	1	a	I scrapped my car twice in the same day, and the guys here were amazing. Honest, quick, and quality work. Awesome, awesome place!
2227	0	a	"When this place was brand new, I was so excited to try it out.  It's very local to my office, sushi is my favorite, and I love giving my money to small businesses vs. large chains.  The first two times I went, the service was a little slow...attributed to being new, I'm sure of it...but the sushi was fabulous!  And the ginger salad dressing is the best I've ever had.  Not that sweet creamy stuff that I despise.  That said, I was eager to return today for more delicious sushi!\nToday, however, was NOTHING like my previous visits.  The waitress brought soup for my friend and then....nothing.  We had to ask her to get our drinks and also my salad...she forgot.  Ok, it was busy before we came in, she's just gathering herself....no problem.  I ordered my usual shrimp tempura roll add cucumber with eel sauce and sriracha on the side. The sushi chef gives me one side of eel sauce, sriracha, and spicy mayo ALL MIXED TOGETHER.  I told the waitress that I can't eat mayo, it makes me very sick and can I please have the eel sauce and sriracha in their own small containers.  She does this.  Then I got my roll.....without cucumber.  UGH.  She gives me a side of cucumber that I fumble with to eat on top.  Crisis averted.  Then I bit into the roll....this is where it gets weird.  So, usually the shrimp tempura roll is one shrimp stretched straight and deep fried.  This was not that.  This was a MASS of BABY SHRIMP that was deep fried and put in the middle.  Now, I wouldn't have cared if it tasted the same.  But it didn't.  Have you ever over cooked those baby shrimp?  They turn into chewy hard pieces of rubber.  Well, that's what this was.  Chewy hard rubbery meat with too much greasy batter.  So, I speak with the manager.  I ask him if there was a change to this roll lately.  He says to me \""No.  We typically use the one piece of long shrimp, not the baby shrimps.  I don't know why the chef did that.  I will speak with him.\""  I told him it was not good and I could not eat it.  He apologized and walked away.  I got my bill.  The (uneaten) roll was still on it.  I spoke with him and told him that I didn't eat it, it was not good.  He said that the most he could do is discount the check 10%.  Here's my problem....I said to him....I have no issues paying for anything at all.  But this is a customer satisfaction issue and it wasn't even edible.  I would gladly pay for the cali roll I took to go and my salad, but I don't understand paying for 90% of a roll that I didn't eat.  He said \""I'm sorry for the inconvenience\""....but that is all.  10%....which totaled about $1.60.\nI'm not sure what planet this guy was from.  He TOLD ME that it was made wrong.  AGREED.  Then STILL CHARGED ME FOR IT. \nSo, I won't be back.  That's a shame because it was so convenient.\nLet me say also that had the manager said, \""I'm sorry your food was wrong and inedible.  I took that $6.25 roll off your check and I hope you will give us another chance to get it right in the future\"".  I would have said, no problem....things like this happen. And then I would have been back over and over.\nIt's sad that a manager with no customer service skills killed this place for me.  Oh, and I'm in Human Resources for my company with 135 coworkers.\n\nI sure hope this place gets their act together.  $6.25 was a small price to pay to get many return visits. Horrible business decision on their part."
2228	1	a	We had a pretty good experience here tonight! It's byob, great service and friendly staff. We got some nigiri sushi(maguro and sake) and 3 rolls. \nThe futomaki roll was big, rainbow roll was delicious, and really liked the Alaskan roll too! Also, the house salad dressing was great! Really enjoyed the salad, too. \nIt was a bit pricy ( green tea was $2.99!) but it's hard to find a decent sushi spot in Pittsburgh, so we will definitely come back to try other things!
2229	0	a	I work in Carnegie and passed this joint on a regular basis, so I decided to get some takeout. I sat down around 12:30, ordered the Udon - a relatively simple dish with noodles and veggies.... they didn't have it ready until 1:15.
2230	1	a	Dacia and her crew are the best!  Dacia has been my hairstylist for the past 6 years and I love the way my hair looks and feels. My hair is blonde so I have it highlighted about every 6 to 8 weeks.  I receive many compliments on my hair on how healthy and shiny it looks. I trust Dacia completely with my hair, I usually just sit on the chair and she takes over with her expertise and sense of style. Dacia and the rest of the stylists are genuine and friendly people with great sense of humor! I would not hesitate to recommend Shag Me Salon to anyone as I know that Dacia and her crew are all true professionals who are knowledgeable in every kind of hair trend.
2231	1	a	"You know what I love? Walking out of a salon completely satisfied and feeling fabulous.\n\nI've been going to see Sam for about three years. I'm not the most consistent about my hair, and Sam always works with me for whatever my hair needs are. I will spend the rest of the day catching my reflection and giggling at how incredible I look. Every single time. \n\nThe new space is totally rad. It's open, colorful, the TVs had \""Fight Club\"" and \""Girl, Interrupted\"" going while I was there, and the atmosphere is relaxed and accepting. I cannot recommend this salon, or it's stylists, enough. Quit surfing Yelp and make your appointment already."
2232	0	a	I used to really like this place at the old location but this new one seemed very unprofessional and messy but I decided to give it a go because with my work schedule I have a hard time making appointments and they took me as a walk in, Kellee did my hair and she was really quiet and just seemed uninterested in her job. She didn't even ask me much about what I wanted so I assumed she got it, the highlights she did are very uneven so that one side is much lighter than the other, I have long hair with no layers so the cut or trim I thought would be simple but since she spent over an hour drying and curling my hair ( she did this without asking if that was how I wanted it styled) I couldn't even tell what the cut looked like when I left. I don't think she even asked if I liked the final product. once I washed and dried it myself I saw that she butchered my long bangs, they were all choppy and she cut more so they were way too thick, I'm so glad I didn't have her cut layers!... I'm really disappointed I have to go spend more money to have this fixed! It wasn't the worst color or cut I've ever had but for $130 and very poor customer service I definitely feel cheated. If you go here don't go as a walk in, I've had good experiences in the past with Erika, but I won't be coming back here...
2233	0	a	I wish I had read these reviews and talked to Vernon instead of Nathan. Nathan promised to help me move my ITunes to my new Galaxy. The ITunes were only on the phone I traded in, so when he sent me home to transfer the data myself over some program he sent me (that stupid program downloaded a bunch of crap on to my desktop,) it was all lost. That wasn't entirely his fault.  I can suck that up and spend a week downloading all my cd's again, but Nathan refuses to return phone calls and emails. To add insult to injury, when I went back to retrieve the $80.00 case that I left on my trade-in phone, it was gone. Thanks, Nathan.
2234	1	a	just ate there the other day and i was very happy with the service they provided after there was some confusion about what i had ordered, they sent it back it, fixed it, and it was delicious. smash burger is not the healthiest of places since it has a lot of grease but it does hit that hang over spot.
2235	1	a	I love Smash Burger first off, so I came in with high expectations. They did a great job at this new location. Food tasted great as usual, presentation was also good. They were pretty busy but got to us very quickly. Great job all the way around.
2236	0	a	"So I've been here twice. First time I got the Truffle Mushroom Swiss and some Smashfries. To go. It was alright. Wasn't overwhelmed - I was hungry and it hit the spot. Next time I came with some coworkers. We were all excited because here was a new place pretty close to where we work and it could be high on our lunch rotation. But that idea came to a crashing halt when we got our food. This time I got the Spinach, Cucumber and Goat Cheese burger. I know. Sounds pretty metrosexual but I was curious. I also got the Haystack Onions. Well when I bit into the burger, I had to wonder if Bessie, the cow I was biting into, hadn't fallen in love with the salt lick and continously deep throated it for the rest of her days. Dang burger was salty as heck. The Haystack Onions were too. I would have let it slide if it were just me. My coworkers, however, said the same thing. It took the three of us to finish the haystack onions because I could not have more than just a bit of that oversalted mess. Service was pretty sucky too. The Einstein that brought the first burger took away the number on the table so the next guy that brought the rest of the burgers only knew to stop at our table because we flagged him down. Yeah yeah. The place is still \""new.\"" So this is the moment - like in a game of Hearts when somebody drops the queen of spades or some card with hearts on it - breaking hearts, as they say. I'm dropping a turd in this circle jerk of a punchbowl with everybody dropping five stars all around. We ain't coming back. Sorry. Smashburger apparently isn't for everyone."
2237	0	a	Another burger place.  Don't get me wrong, I love hamburgers, but I don't need more temptation to eat another burger.  This is the third one within a mile, not including McDonlds and The Vine.\n\nIt was not easy getting into this place either if you're East bound on Elliot Rd.\nI drove around that parking lot looking for a way on that doesn't currently exist.   :-p\n\nI will tell you service was prompt and polite.  Menu appears to have some decent options.\nMy fail was to combine some toppings on the burger that just didn't blend well.  I don't understand.  Blue cheese, spinach, tomatoe, and onion is GREAT as a salad.  On top of a burger it was blech.  \nBurger was well done, as in overcooked.  And greasy.\nThe egg bun is good.\nFrench fries are alright.\nShake was tasty, but how often do you encounter a shake fail.  \n\nPersonally, I dont think we'll be back here very often.
2238	0	a	Way to much salt on everything and I like salt but this was over the top. I was looking forward the the veggie fries but I couldn't eat more than a few. The chicken was fatty, really fatty and flavorless aside from the layer of salt.\nMy friend raves about the burgers so maybe that's the way to go....\n\n\nHonest to god I wouldn't eat here again for free. Gross.
2239	0	a	Very disappointed in this store. Just when I was excited that a Petco was opening across the street, my hopes were immediately crushed once I visited. Although it is a nic store, it was initially hard to locate the items I needed. It started off on a bad not when I entered at about 8pm and wasn't souch as greeted or asked if I needed help locating anything. Myself and another patron both assisted each other in locating the items we needed but after having to search without store help for almost a half hour, we both left empty handed. I gave two stares because the store was beautifully set up and they had ferrets which I adore. I will continue to visit Petsmart on Ft Apache in the future.
2240	1	a	"Stopped in here last week for the preview and absolutely adored the space, the cats, and the whole \""cat cafe\"" experience. They didn't have a menu available yet, but the Thai iced tea sample that they offered was lovely.  The cats were so relaxed and friendly, and the staff was really sweet. Too bad I was only in Montreal for vacation, otherwise I would be stopping in every day!"
2241	0	a	"Came here after much waiting and anticipation, only to be grossly disappointed. I had to wait outside the door for  for a bit, before I was allowed in, because they are afraid the cats might escape, then I was stopped and told to disinfect my hands with the Purell by the door,before entering a very narrow \""lounge\"" area where the (3) cats are. I then was informed to take a seat, (rickety) at an available table, then exit the lounge, to the cash, order my drink, then wait. I ordered an iced tea, (regular size) at a whopping $4.54 (with tax) , then had to wait an eternity before it was finally delivered to my table. Meanwhile, a sour -looking \""waiter\"" approached me while I was still waiting for my tea, and demanded to know if I had ordered anything ! He then had the temerity to demand if I had paid, I replied yes to both, and he stalked off! My tea arrived finally, after a good 20 minutes, but it was merely flavoured ginger ale!!  When I informed this same useless, sad excuse for a waiter, that this is NOT iced tea, he replied this is how they make it! Imagine that!! Sorry, boys and girls, this is NOT how you make iced tea, and keep it up with your clueless, useless (non)  service and you'll be gone faster than many of your predecessors who previously had the address!  To add insult to injury, one of the girls working there, proceeded to  wipe down my table with Javex wipes, AFTER I had been sitting there for over 30 minutes, and was drinking my tea! Should not this have been done BEFORE??? Sloppy! As for cats roaming freely about the place, good luck, there are only 3 (on that day) clustered at the window, stay in that sapce, and do NOT really roam about the narrow room, corridor, more like. Overall, a very disappointing, pricey experience."

2243	0	a	One word. Disappointing. I traveled quite far from one end of the Montreal island to the plateau to check out this brand new first ever Cat Cafe. I really felt like there was no design or effort put into the environment and atmosphere. Honestly, it was just a room with some cats in the corner, with a couple of cheap tables and chairs. I seriously just sat down with my coffee for 10 minutes then left. One, it was not a comfortable place, two, I felt cramped and three, there was no cafe ambiance to me. I understand this is a cat cafe, but I feel they should at least put some more thought and consideration into the look and feel of the place. I mean this is supposed to be Montreal's first cat cafe!\n\nOn the plus side, there were some beautiful cats! But sadly, they are not enough for me to come back again.
2244	0	a	It's too bad. The cats are cute. The concept is nice. I waited for 15 minutes for someone to come serve me and no one came. I spent my time watching people take selfies and photos with cats. And then I left. I'm looking forward for the one on Duluth to open up. Maybe they will have better service?
2245	0	a	"This place is a rip off and does a poor job. I got suckered into buying the \""Unlimited\"" package which is $60 a month (not worth it).  I used plenty of spray tan salons in California and was much cheaper and the tan was a lot better. Moving to Arizona I saw the reviews and figured this place must be amazing. WRONG. The tan is streaky, makes you look dirty, and comes off on all of my clothes. I know how to properly take care of a spray tan and this one is just disgusting. Then, I told them I want to cancel my membership because I was moving back to California and they would not make any exceptions and charged me for the upcoming month (which I'm not going to use) and a $75 cancellation fee. I don't recommend going here and they are unhelpful, don't feel welcoming at all, and overall poor at their services."
2246	1	a	Love a good local beer, this is the place to stop and shop.  The 7th street public market is complete with vendors and a great place to enjoy lunch, grab a few unique things and enjoy time with friends and family it's got something for everyone. \n\nNow Tank's Tap is a new favorite, great local beers on tap and plenty of other craft beer in the fridge. Staff is fantastic and oh so friendly, grab a beer and order something to eat at one of the great lunch spots and they will bring your order over to you at the bar. \n\nSports fan no problem games are on the TV, just a fun spot all around to enjoy a break. Oh and their growler fill system keeps your growler fresh for 2-3 weeks.  Love this place!
2247	1	a	Very friendly bartenders and lovely chocolate cocktail menu (and beer for those who dont appreciate chocolate!) Glad we found this place! Its inside the New York New York next to the Hershey's store. Fermin our bartender was very good at recommendations!
2248	1	a	The chocolate bar is where you get your chocolate fix on.  And Jennifer, the bartender, is the best!!!  I had the Death By Chocolate, wife had Hershey's Caramel Martini and bro in law, Reese's Peanut Butter Cup Martini.  She made them luscious and strong.  She's so nice and makes you feel very welcome.  She deserves a raise.   \n\nThis is going to be a regular for us every time we visit Las Vegas.  And hopefully Jennifer will be here.  You can't miss this place, it's right outside the Hershey's store in New York New York.  \n\nIf you love chocolate, you'll love The Chocolate Bar.
2249	1	a	We visited the Hershey's Chocolate World store at street side of the New York New York Casino - on the way toward taking a wild ride on the New York New York roller coaster.\n\nI noticed the Chocolate Bar when we exited the Hershey's Chocolate World store on the ground floor level walking in toward the casino.\n\nMy wife likes chocolate a way more than me. My wife likes martinis - I like rum drinks. My wife was not wild about having a drink at 1:00 PM. However we were interested in a couple of items on the Chocolate Bar menu. Two girls sitting at the bar who were just finishing their drinks, gave the Death by Chocolate Martini drink a high recommendation.\n\nI decided to have the Reese's Pieces Rum Martini & my wife had the Caramel Chocolate Martini. We agreed that the Reece's Pieces Rum Martini was the better of the two. Both drinks came with skewered chocolate candy garnish.\n\nAs we sat there another couple stop by and a single guy stop by to try drinks - which led to pleasant light conversation.\n\nWe recommended the Reece's Pieces Rum Martini to two girls who had sat down as we were leaving.\n\nBoth drinks that we had delivered great flavour. We got a nice buzz from the 3 ounce drinks. Surprisingly there was no sugar high & subsequent crash afterward from the drinks - which was nice.\n\nThis was a great experience and we would recommend the Chocolate Bar to anyone who enjoys a drink.
2250	1	a	Can you say BOMB.com! I love this place, it is just what we needed Downtown! I am a vegan and not many options down here by the job but there crust and marinara sauce are vegan and there are so many veggies to choose from. The crew is is always great, fun and inviting. My pizza is alays cooked exactly the way I want, you can't ask for more than that. Check them out!
2251	1	a	Very happy with my lashes and would recommend to anyone. I'll continue coming back
2252	0	a	"The store on 91st Avenue, in Peoria, has been open for a while, but I just got around to checking it out a few weeks ago, when I was redoing my guest bedroom.  Up until this evening, it's been great, but up until this evening, I haven't had to test their customer service skills.  Bad training.\nOver the weekend, I bought a stretched canvas print and it had a coordinating print, but the coordinating print was poorly stretched, and you could tell the canvas was kind of 'floppy'.  I didn't buy it this past weekend for that reason, but after thinking about it, I knew I could bring it home and re-stretch it, but didn't feel like I should have to pay full retail for it, being that I would have to 'fix it'.  I asked the cashier if she would give me a discount, because of how poorly it was stretched.  She said \""that's the way they all are\"".  I told her that I just bought the coordinating print to this one and it was stretched fine.  She said \""the most I could give you is 10%\"" and then made a couple of snide comments like \""I guess I don't know my products\"" and \""I'm not lying, they are all like that.\""  After her comments, I told her never mind, and she said, \""ok!  have a nice night!\""  VERY snotty.  I think At Home needs to train their help in Customer Service a little bit better.  Oh, this all happened around 5:45 p.m. tonight, so in case any management people read this, you should be able to figure out who I'm referring to.  Blonde, no makeup, rude, cashier."
2253	0	a	"I am a Professional Designer and after the way I was treated by one of the \""staff\"" members hanging up on me and then after calling back she would not even answer the store phone I was convinced that this person was extremely unprofessional in her job and should not even be working for the Company Garden Ridge which by the way is located in Plano, TX. I called the chief of operations for the corp office and a few others at the top level and let them know about this staff member. I had already spent a $1,000 and was prepared to spend an additional $3,000 to $4,000 today but why should I give a company like this my money with  staff treating me like garbage. \nForget it I will take my business else where where I get treated like I am the customer and I get some respect and not hung up on. Oh and I called back 4 hours later and the SAME person answered the phone and she put me on hold and never came back. Unreal. I suggest you NEVER CALL if you plan to shop with these idiots. FYI they do have some incredible items IF you go through the junk to find a few jewels. \nGreat prices on certain items like Big Mirrors are a steal. Art work very reasonable prices if you need fill-in art. \nGood luck to you all."
2254	1	a	A major positive of this store is the selection of unique furniture and wall art. I was looking for canvas paintings and there were aisles of them and at an affordable price, which is very difficult to find. There were also plenty of other accents and furniture all over the store, lots of beautiful and unique finds. I like vintage and antique shops, but they tend to carry items that need to be restored and are still pretty pricey so I'd rather go to a store like this and just buy something new that is still unique.
2255	1	a	Love the Reggio Emilia philosophy behind this preschool!!! This is a fabulous alternative approach to schooling our children. Simone creates a loving and supportive environment where the children can explore and discover through a self guided curriculum. My son attended one of the Nesting Places' summer camps and absolutely love it! If you are looking for an alternative approach to education Nesting Place would be wonderful place for your little one.
2256	1	a	My daughter goes here and LOVES it! She loves Miss Simone. I like the natural approach to learning and the fact that she is learning christian values at the same time. The classroom is set up in a very child friendly, open and bright setting. The children get to play and learn outside as well, which all children love.
2257	0	a	"Unfortunately I can't rate the beer or atmosphere since they locked their doors early and I couldn't try what they have. \n\nYesterday (wednesday 9/17) I swung by and tried to check out this new brewery in the \""booze district.\"" I had done my homework: I went on their website, read about the brewers, noted their cool logo, read about their beer and note the time they were open \""Wed-Fri 5pm-10pm; sat 12p-10p, sun 12p-8p\""\n\nBUTTTT when I went by at 8:37pm I could see in, and tell they were already cleaning up. Weird, but I tried the door anyways. It was locked. I thought I had made a mistake, no sign on the door saying \""we closed early\"" the hours of operation next to the door clearly stated they were suppose to be open until 10pm that night. I rattled the door a bit more, hoping it was some mistake...but no, the guy cleaning up just kept on doing so. The 2-3 persons sitting at the bar just kept on going. \n\nSad, since I was really looking forward to this place. IDK what to tell you...maybe call ahead and make sure they're really going to be open when they say they'll be open? I would hate for any of you all to drive across town and the doors be locked."
2258	1	a	"So far so good! \n\nThey only have 3  of their own beers available right now, but I liked everything I've tasted so far. They are currently offering the regular saison, pomegranate saison, and an IPA, and they also offer other beers on tap like lagunitas. I talked to one of the brewers and he said hopefully by next month they will be ready with a few more beers. The atmosphere is really nice and relaxing with lots of different seating options. They have tables, bar stools and even small couches. \n\nThe owner told me that there will be another brewery opening up soon in the \""booze district\"" so keep your eyes open for that! Looks like this area is really shaping up!"
2259	0	a	The owner is very nice, however  the beer is not that great.  It was very blah.  They only had two of their own beers on tap and the rest where guest beers.  I was not impressed with their beer ...seemed a little watered down.
2260	1	a	We have since come back and tried this brewery and it was open during the hours of operation. I was reluctant...but I'm really glad we did! Loved it. \n\nThey've put a lot of thought and effort into designing the layout of the bar. You have long tables for groups, and a comfortable bar. They have cuckoo clocks on the wall (matching the logo) and wide open windows to see what is going on in the back. \n\nSteve was a friendly brewer who clearly has a lot of knowledge about beer and craft breweries. He's got a laid back attitude but still saw to every persons beer needs. He's willing to talk shop and is clearly passionate about what he does, and proud of the product he makes (as they should be).\n\nWe grabbed a flight of beers since we hadn't tried their beers prior. I personally loved the Lemon grass. My husband liked the double hopped one. They had 3 of theirs on tap+some guest beers. We will be back because they're going to be releasing new holiday editions like a maple one and a few others.  \n\nAlso, great for groups, you can order pizza etc and pair with the breweries beers. (We will do this next time).\n\nCheers!
2261	0	a	Went here the other day and here is my opinion on the place.\n\nMaybe because it was their soft opening, it was kinda all over the place but:\n\nThe place is small but nice, easy to ready menu and lots of options(Soft opening so not all were available)\n\nThe Sisig which I normally am a big fan of was hard. Not crispy like I've had before but HARD. not pleasant to eat but did have alot of flavor.\n\nAdobo was good but missing a little flavor to be honest. Had it in tacos form and on my bowl.\n\nWe were charged extra for some reason. The garlic rice was .50  extra and that was fine but that didn't explain the extra $3 charge  and on our receipt as the order was cut off where it showed the items. Didn't want to wait in line to go back and argue since we had already waited 10 min.\n\nThe kitchen staff and front were completely all over the place and no one was really focused on the customer. Waited in line for 10 min before even ordering. They were yelling at each other back and forth and the guy kept yelling at the cashier though she seemed as if she just started but instead of yelling, he could have explained it to her in a calm way...\n\nReceived food and we were missing some tacos. They did quickly give them to us but it seemed everyone who went here had to go back since they were missing an item so CHECK YOUR ORDER!!\n\nI will try again as maybe they were having issues with it barely being open but so far unimpressed :/... Was super excited after having great food and service at their food truck.
2262	1	a	Friendly staff. Food was delicious.  My kids loved the adobo!!!  Cozy seating. Thanks for having clean dining and highchairs.  The chamarado is delicious!
2263	0	a	Came here to give it a try because we saw it on LV weekly. The inside is small with only about 5 tables.  The menu is categorized in a weird way. It just didn't really flow. \n\nThe food we ordered was the beefsteak carne fries, pork sisig and pork tocino. \n\nThe beefsteak fries was French fries with Swiss cheese topped with the beefsteak meat. The meat was super salty and the fries were drenched in salt. Every bite was basically a mouthful of salt. \n\nThe pork sisig taco was just pork in a small taco tortilla. That's it. No toppings, no sauce, just meat and tortilla. It was also salty. The meat was not quite crispy it was more hard like sand when you chewed it. \n\nThe last thing we ate was the pork tocino. It had a little bit of cole slaw on top. Not much flavor in slaw. The meat was salty but there was a hint of sweetness in the marinade. \n\nI feel like this food would be great as food truck options but as a cafe it was pretty basic and not too good. I can still taste all the salt in my mouth now as I am writing this review and I ate 45mins ago.
2264	0	a	Customer  service  was horrible my wife waited for 10 min. For someone to take her order. Then I waited for a refill for 15 min while one of workers walked  around the kitchen not doing anything. She looked straight  at me and didn't ask if I needed anything. Food is OK not the greatest. If customer  service is better I would recommend  it.
2265	0	a	"Overpriced food soaked in salt. Need I say more? Filipino dish is naturally salty but their food is overly salty. We ordered beef steak (bistek) and it was horrible. All I tasted was lemon and salt. Whatever happen to the beef? We also ordered pork tocino and again, it was horrible. It was chopped up into tiny pieces and overcooked. It seemed like I was eating \""pork tocino chips.\"" The lumpia was not fully cooked in the inside. Lastly, their picture menu is misleading. They had eggs with the tocino when in fact they don't come together. The eggs need to be ordered separately. \n\nOverall, I was not pleased with their food, their food presentation, and their misleading menu."
2266	1	a	The food here is great!  I had the tacos (choice of three) Chicken Adobo, Pork Sisig and the beefsteak for $6.95.  All great tasting and complimented with a vinaigrette slaw; however my favorite was the Pork Sisig. Centrally located, food is delicious, therefore I will be back!!!
2267	0	a	The sisig burrito was dry, crunchy, and not what I expected. My friend got the Tocino burrito which was also dry and not sweetened at all.
2268	0	a	Ehh not worth my time or $$ \nI rather go to El gordo and get my tacos \n\nIdk about their rice dish but the meat on my tacos is the big thing here..  so I would say it ain't all that .. \n\nWon't come back again I'm sorry.\n\nThis place takes forever to make my orders and I was not satisfied.
2269	0	a	Hey have you heard have you heard that White Rabbit opened a brick and mortar location right here in Vegas? Where you say? Right off Jones between Spring Mountain and Desert Inn, the same plaza as 168 market.\n\nI've only had White Rabbit candy. Anything from this White Rabbit or the food truck prior to this? Nope, but I've heard a lot of great things about them. They do have a good fan base a lot of people like them. They may have been featured in some tv show or newspaper/magazine. Honestly I don't even know, just heard their a foodtruck and that people like them. I liked their customer service.\n\nA group from work went here after having heard they opened. I told the staff that we've never had them and wanted something they were known for or was fans raved about. The sisig was suggested without hesitation. So I was hoping it was gonna be amazing. No one in the group liked it.  It was pretty bad that I had to eat sisig somewhere else to satisfy my craving. It was pretty dry and didn't taste right at some parts, mushy at others. It remembered me of a overcooked mixture of canned corned beef and some other items. What I got, the rice bowl combo with drink was about $8-9 food truck size and price, wasn't filling. \n\nI probably wouldn't go back. But at least they have other items other than sisig and have a fan base.
2270	1	a	Good eats by great people!!
2271	0	a	White Rabbit was just okay. I tried the sisig burrito and made it a combo which comes with a drink and a side. Side orders consist of fries, coleslaw, lumpia, taco, etc. I chose lumpia. First things first, the lumpia pieces were TINY! They were a little bit bigger than a freaking tater tot. They weren't anything spectacular either. I bet they were frozen. Also, the drinks are only one size and they are 12oz. I didn't dine in, but I would sure hope they offer free refills if you choose to eat there.\n\nThe burrito was ok, but it was missing flavor. I wish I would have grabbed some banana ketchup on my way out because the burrito needed it badly. The sisig was crispy, but that's about all I can say about it. I didn't taste any onion or jalape\u00f1o as it says accompanies the sisig during cooking. I probably wont be back.
2272	0	a	I'm a fan of the White Rabbit food truck, after living in So Cal, and I was pretty stoked to have it here in Vegas.  However, I was unpleasantly surprised by their customer service at their grand opening a couple weeks ago.  \n\nIt was my Mom's first time having their food, which was delicious -totally satisfies a tasty bite type of craving- but it felt like we were undermined when everyone around us, EVERYONE, was being catered to but us.  It seemed like they were either friends of owners and workers there, or familiar customers, so that's why they were given a lot of attention.  Someone did come up to us as we were finishing up, but he seemed so distracted, that I don't think he was even listening to whatever we were conversing about.  Trust me, my mom and I are not ones to be attention seekers, but it just made our dining experience awkward, especially when they started giving shirts away to everyone they knew, which was everyone in the restaurant but us.  At this rate, I'd stick to the food truck if that option still stood.
2273	1	a	I've only ever had White Rabbit at FoodieFest but found out that they had opened a restaurant on Jones so I thought to stop by and grab some food.  I definitely liked their Beefsteak burrito but found it was too much food for me (though not a bad thing, I just personally can't finish it), so I decided to order tacos and some other things like lumpia and champorado (because, what Filipino would pass these up!?)\n\nThe food is very tasty but what made the experience deserving of a 5-star rating was the exemplary service I received. The servers/cashiers Justin and Kristin were very informative and were very helpful in helping me make a selection with their recommendations. They were very nice and friendly and their cook for the evening, Arnold(?) was fast and efficient so I did not have to wait long to receive my order.  \n\nAll in all, I did enjoy my food as well as my visit there and would happily recommend it to my family and friends!!
2274	0	a	"Did I get a \""Bad Batch\"" or what? Got the Tocino bowl w/Garlic Rice & 2 Eggs. 3 Tacos; Bisteak, Sisig & Adobo. Unfortunately, the \""Shredded\"" Tocino, Bisteak & Sisig were just way too salty! If these are \""Franchise\"" recipes, then it's too bad. If not, please taste the food before sending it out & balance the flavors. Especially if people are going to pay $17+ for 2 small dishes. Friend & I couldn't even finish the food and the serving was not big. High sodium dishes... True Filipino Cuisine! Lol"
2275	1	a	Tres bon cafe nouveau look tres class et embiance genial le service est rapide et les gens sont tres courtois
2276	0	a	Tr\u00e8s mauvaise exp\u00e9rience \u00e0 cet endroit. Mauvais service (caf\u00e9 ordinaire servi sans cuill\u00e8re, ni lait, pas de serviettes de table), nourriture froide, serveur trop timide \u00e0 qui il faut tout demander. Il y a du travail \u00e0 faire! Les belles photos et beaux sites Internet ne suffisent parfois pas. Bonne chance!
2277	1	a	Enjoyed a wonderful meal tonight with my daughters. Attentive service, beautiful space, and varied menu. Our favorite menu item? Bacon wrapped asparagus. Smoky, bacon goodness. And since asparagus is included, it must be good for you, right? The seaweed salad was well-seasoned. Tasty tempura, well-done dumplings, and al-dente ramen rounded out a great meal. Looking forward to trying more of the yakitori. So pleased to see another great addition to our neighborhood's restaurant scene.
2278	1	a	could say more about this wounderful place, evreything is so delicious especially the ramen. i would definately come back for it.
2279	1	a	"Japanese tapas! I've been waiting for this place to open for weeks...my friends and I went on a Friday night and were immediately greeted and seated.  It's really urban inside, with traditional Asian accents.  The ropes separating the tables are a unique touch.\n\nOur sever was super friendly and informed us that they were still \""soft opening\"", and let us know that they hadn't yet gotten their full inventory in, but would be continually adding new and exotic options in the future.  Beer was almost all Japanese and I couldn't resist Sapporo on draft.  They have a large sake list and I will definitely try some next time.\n\nEverything is family-style, meant to be shared, so you can feel free to try something you've never had before (Takoyaki, or octopus balls, WOW) and not feel like you committed to something you may not like.  We had takoyaki, beef wrapped enoki mushrooms, gyoza, and Tonkatsu (pork broth) ramen, and it was so insanely good...like, REALLY good.  It comes out randomly, but that's part of the fun.  My partner and I placed bets on which items would come next, haha, it's a good game.  All told,I can't believe they've only been open a few days.  \n\nHere's to many more good nights!"
2280	1	a	"Yayyy! Plaza Midwood has a new restaurant. They are having their grand opening on 10/17 and said that there will be free bites- so check it out.\n\nFirst of all- THANNK YOU. Thank you for taking a risk and opening in PM's awkward strip mall. This strip mall has improved so much in the past few years. It is really awesome to see businesses going in there. \n\nWe ordered the bacon wrapped asparagus and squid for starters. The asparagus was green asparagus and white asparagus (nice touch).  They were good. I wasn't blown away, but definitely tasty. \n\nWe also ordered the pork ramen. THAT MY FRIENDS is delicious. The pork is marinated in teriyaki sauce and it the broth is made over a ridiculous amount of time (8 hours? Something like that). I really want to try the miso and the chicken ramen. I have big plans for eating plenty of ramen this winter. The portion was so large that I have plenty for lunch today. We were stupidly confused by their menu. When it says \""extra\"" they mean \""you already have this, but if you want to pay extra for a another egg it is....\"". That was our fault, but just wanted to give a heads up to anyone else who also my struggle with reading menus.\n\nOverall, the place is delicious. I think the prices a little high, but not too high to come back. I am interested in trying more of their small bites."
2281	0	a	Decor very cute, swanky. Service 5 star!!!  Drinks unique and excellent. Yelling at staff head chef....yep they got one!! Lamb lollipops the size of actual lollipops....6 dollars each....that's there too.....!!?? Family style dishes for sharing....that won't fill a bird.....yikes.  its tapas... so dont go if you are hungry or make sure it's payday....I won't be back unless I am meeting someone for drinks. Im going for dinner where I get a meal after a long hard day.
2282	1	a	Must try the pork ramen!  The broth is out of this world.  Was not a fan of the pancake...too fishy for me.  Great atmosphere.  The sake nigori and the blueberry mojitos were delicious.  I'm going to introduce everyone I know to this place!
2283	1	a	This spot was a newfound GEM.  I am so happy that finally there is a true Izakaya  (Japanese gastrolounge) here in Charlotte finally:  Yakitori & Other small bites, Home-made Ramen soups, and Sakes.  Just to level set, this is an izakaya restaurant so don't expect sushi (that's offered at their other restaurant, Yama Asian in Southpark) or any hibachi.  Their ramen soup broth is made from scratch and cooked down for a really loooooong time, the way you're supposed to it. Everything we had was skillfully seasoned, prepared, and grilled/cooked. \n\nHighly recommended and not highly priced like Baku in Southpark.
2284	0	a	This ramen was a joke. Our waitress told us it was Top Ramen, and I guess I had the creamy chicken flavored with what seemed like sliced lunchmeat in it (ordered the $13 Tonkotsu)\n\nThe waitress was not very pleasant after we questioned why they used such poor ingredients. Will not be returning.
2285	1	a	Started the experience with a cup of green tea. The tea was room temperature and with a little honey it added the sweetness I was looking for. Also added a small bite of Buta Kakuni (braised pork belly). It was soaked in a ginger type sauce. It was good. \n\nOrdered the Tonkostu (pork bone broth). This was amazing!! This is what made my experience. The pork broth soup has been simmering for about 12 hours. Very flavorful that came with a creamy base. On top was braised pork belly that were sliced very thin. Along with the pork came bamboo shoots, half of a hard boiled egg, and the ramen noodle. \nThe ramen noodle had a good texture. The noodle soaked up the pork broth sauce well. I also ordered extra noodles in my dish and it was very filling!\n \nIf you are looking for a new restaurant in the Charlotte area and looking for that Ramen fix, I would highly suggest this place. It is worth the $14 for a bowl of Ramen soup. Next time I would like to try the Soba Noodles.
2286	0	a	Shocked by all these good reviews. We thought the food was terrible and the atmosphere cold.   It's a shame since we love the original in South Park.
2287	0	a	I was really excited when I heard there was a new ramen place in town, but I guess I had too high of expectations for this place.\n\nWhen I first arrived, I thought that the atmosphere was really great and the decorations were pretty awesome.  I sat at a table where there were ropes hanging from the ceiling to the bottom separating us from the other table.  I thought it was pretty cool.  The lighting in there was dim, so it felt like a great intimate place for a date, or just a small group of friends.\n\nThe ramen was what I was excited about, but the their Small Bites were what was amazing to me.  Definitely try the Ika Geso (fried squid tenticles), Takoyaki (fried octopus ball) and Hamachi Jalapenos.  The Tuna Salad is pretty wicked as well!  If you go there, TRY THE SMALL BITES!!!  Now as for their ramen, it's a different story.  I had ordered the Tonkostu Ramen and asked for it to be spicy.  I did not taste any spiciness in it or did I really taste any flavor as it was very bland.  It really made me sad that it was bland.\n\nThe service here was really nice.  I quite enjoyed our waiter as he was friendly and very patient to explain things when we weren't sure what it was that we were ordering or wanted more of an explanation.\n\nI know I want to give this place another try in the future, and I hope that when I do, they step up their ramen game.
2288	0	a	"First time trying Yama Izakaya and went with a group, two of whom had been once before. Waitress was fantastic, very friendly and attentive. When we inquired about gluten-free options, we were informed YI does not have any, and we were told this isn't an oversight, but rather the owner is anti-gluten-free. Meaning, he is one of those people who doesn't believe Celiac disease or gluten sensitivities are actually a \""thing\"". Not a great start...\n\nMost of the group ordered noodle soup dishes and thought they were fine, but not good enough to patronize the establishment again. One of the group, the GF member, ordered teriyaki chicken, even though they knew it wasn't GF, but it was the best we could do... The chicken pieces were HORRIBLE, chewy, rubbery and gristly, and worse than you would expect from the cheapest, greasiest Chinese take-out place. \n\nTo be clear, YI doesn't even offer a GF noodle option, much less GF soy sauce. Rice noodles would be such an easy option for a restaurant such as YI to offer, but first the owner would have to care about GF guests. \n\nNeedless to say, we won't be returning."
2289	1	a	The service was great here. The management was very attentive and polite and the food was excellent. I had the miso cod and the tonkatsu ramen. Everything was excellent. I will def be returning to this restaurant more often even if it's out of the way for me.
2290	0	a	We dined here for my boyfriends birthday a few days ago and we were highly disappointed with the food. The miso ramen had a rank, overly fishy taste and smell making it inedible. The pork ramen was okay, but it also had an unpleasant, spoiled taste to it as well. Overall I would say that the food is overpriced and poorly executed. Soul gastrolounge down the street is a much better option for both ramen and tapas.
2291	1	a	This food was absolutely delicious. I ordered udon and my two friends both ordered ramen. We all thought it was very tasty. Honestly I will be dreaming about it until I come again. My only complaint is its a little pricey for my budget but definitely worth it.\n\nAlso, so pleased to find the heated fancy toilet in the women's bathroom. This certainly elevated my experience.
2292	1	a	It's great to have Japanese restaurant that isn't sushi or hibachi or a Japanese steakhouse. They have Hitachino Nest White Ale on tap, which I didn't even know was possible. \n\nWe ordered takoyaki, okonomiyaki, gyoza, and ebi shumai. You can definitely share and make a meal out of the small plates. And that's what you would do at an izakaya in Japan. \n\nTakoyaki and okonomiyaki both came drizzled with sauce, mayonnaise, and topped with bonito fish flakes. They were excellent! Takoyaki was nicely grilled on the outside but soft on the inside. Also very hot, so you know it's fresh. Okonomiyaki was tasty, but not as thick with tons of cabbage as I would like. Still, this is the only place in Charlotte that has it and it was good with crispy bacon on the bottom. \n\nGyoza were crispy on the bottom, and dumpling skins were tender without falling apart. My boyfriend didn't enjoy the ebi shumai as much but I think they were comparable to what I've had in Japan. \n\n To cap it all off, the ladies room has a heated toilet seat with a washlet. \n\nI will definitely be going back to try the ramen!
2293	0	a	"The food was alright, but nothing really stood out.  We had the Spicy Miso, which was zero spicy, and a handful of the \""small bite\"" appetizers.  Nothing was bad, but again, nothing was really good.\n\nThe waitstaff was really annoying, and we didn't really have just one waiter.  There was about 4 or 5 different people that constantly checked on our table, each bringing us/refilling our waters without asking.  Usually this is something I'm for, but at one point we had 12 glasses of water for 6 people at our table.  Instead of taking away the empty cups, the random waiters just continued to fill them.\n\nThis is also one of those places that doesn't write your order down, and they attempt to memorize everything.  Some places do it well, however this is not one of those places.  We had to remind our waitress a handful of times about missing items that she forgot to put in, and they brought us wrong food twice."
2294	0	a	I've been here a total of 4 times. I'm not sure I'll ever go back.\n\nVisit #1 - They were most recently opened and my BF and I were anxious to try on a weekend evening. We walked in and waited about 5 mins for anyone to even acknowledge our presence. They were fairly busy and seemed short staffed but I could see open table so surely they would seat right away. Once we were greeted we were told it would be about 5 or 10 mins for a table to be ready. As we were starving we left to go elsewhere.\n\nVisit #2 - Came in with a party of 5 and were seated right away on a Friday night around 7pm. Our waiter asked if it was our first time (it was for all of us) and he proceeded to give us a brief but informative rundown of the menu and took our questions and answered them expertly. I had bacon wrapped asparagus and a drink special. Very Yum! Everyone was very pleased with the service and quality of the dishes. \n\nVisit #3 - Me and the BF came back a few weeks later on a weeknight. Our waiter once again asked us if we wanted a rundown of the menu and we declined as we were both in the mood for Ramen (he had gotten it previously and loved it). This was was the best thing I can remember eating as of late. So much flavor I didn't want to stop eating. I was unable to finish but I was also glad I had enough left over to eat again the next day. We were promptly provide with to-go soup containers to transport our delicious broth and noodles home.\n\nVisit #4 - It is bitterly cold out this winter and I promised the BF I'd grab some Ramen and bring it home for dinner so we could enjoy it bundled up on the couch.  I walked in today and was greeted promptly as the restaurant was empty at 5:30pm on a weekday. This is how the conversation went with the Hostess ...\n\nMe: Hi, Yes ... I'd like to place a take-out order please.\nYama: Oh, we don't do that.\nMe: I can't place an order to take with me?\nYama: No, our plates are very small and we just don't do that.\nMe: But I've been here before an taken my left overs home in a container.\nYama: Yeah, we can't do that. But you can sit at the bar and have a drink.\nMe: Um, no thanks ... I'll figure something else out.\n\nHOW/WHY WOULD YOU REFUSE A PAYING CUSTOMER THAT WANTS TO BUY YOUR FOOD AND LEAVE YOU A TIP FOR PREPARING THE ORDER THAT WOULD MOST CERTAINLY COME BACK AGAIN AND AGAIN ... NOT TO MENTION HAS BEEN TELLING EVERYONE SHE KNOWS HOW GOOD THE PLACE IS?!\n\nNeedless to say, I'm extremely frustrated and disappointed. Really had my heart set on some Ramen but went to Fuel pizza instead (which was super friendly and very delicious).
2295	1	a	Really good food, quick, clean and many gluten free options! Highly recommend this place, would've given 5 stars if the staff was friendlier in talking to me about the GF options.
2296	1	a	Love this place. Have been here about half a dozen times in the last few weeks. GREAT alternative to fast food. Many healthy options and I love that you can customize your bowls and salads. Tokyo Joe's is like the Chipotle of Japanese food (in a good way!). I love that they put the sauces on the side and give you the option to do double veggies instead of rice or noodles. You can really be in control of the calories that you are consuming here. Sushi is pretty good. Not outstanding but good nonetheless . My favorites are the peanut skewers, crab cheese wonton roll, Yakitori bowl, Ichigo salad and the unsweetened pomegranate green tea. They advertise no MSG, all natural proteins, wild seafood, and organic produce where possible which makes this place even more appealing. Staff has always been friendly and helpful, and the restaurant is always clean and neat. Great option for a quick and healthy bite to eat.
2297	0	a	A bunch of people from my office were ordering it, so I decided to partake. I had an udon noodle bowl with green curry. Very, very mediocre food. I don't understand how that can be called curry. Their noodles were extremely watery.  I would not recommend their food if you're looking for taste.
2298	0	a	So I waited to try this place out, because I wanted to experience it once the kinks were worked out. My boyfriend & I went there for the 1st time last night- we both opted for the build your own bowls. I order a regular size 1/2 chicken, 1/2 steak, with all the veggies, udon noodles, & a spicy peanut sauce. I also ordered a side of spring rolls.\n\nI was very disappointed with the quality of the meat in my bowl. I asked for all white chicken & I received both dark & light. The steak, & I hate saying this, was something I should have fed to my dog. The veggies were cooked well, still had some crunch to them. However the onions on the bowl were raw. The sauce did not taste spicy or like peanuts. The noodles were very watery. \n\nThe spring rolls however were very good! Overall for $14.00, it was not worth it. The quality, & taste was just not good. I should have went to Zoe's or Chipotle, but next time I know that if I am looking for a better, casual dinning option for dinner, I will go else where.\n\nIt is a shame, because I really wanted to like this place & was excited to try it, because it had good Yelp reviews.
2299	1	a	Pretty tasty asian fair. Ate here twice and enjoyed it each time. Will be back whenever I have a taste for noodles or a rice bowl.
2300	1	a	Gluten-Free fast food! Good quality and good price. I love having a quick, tasty option.
2301	1	a	I don't give out too many 5 stars, but Tokyo Joe's deserve it. Very delicious. Every item I tasted was delicious. Very fresh food, flavorful, and healthy. Also, prices are reasonable especially when considering the quality. Service was excellent as well.
2302	1	a	I came back into town catching up with some girlfriends and decided to get our pedicures done. We happened to see this new place and it was beyond amazing! They owners was so nice and made our stay enjoyable. We will definitely be coming back soon!
2303	1	a	Went Saturday at 1130am. I got TyTy and she was super sweet. This place is only 3 months old but she and her husband are very experienced. I got a gel manicure only $22 and that was after removing the acrylics i had on. She made sure it was perfect! This is the only place i have been satisfied with so far. I am definitely coming back.
2304	1	a	The prices are very reasonable, and the spa pedicure is super thorough for being the basic pedicure. The place is also very clean, which is super important to me. They even offer a student discount. The staff is very friendly. My only complaints were that the gel manicure didn't last as long as other gel manicures I have had and I think they put the wrong polish color on me, but I would still go there again. As long as I continue to have positive experiences, this will be my go to salon.
2305	0	a	Furniture is ok but customer service and delivery was worst experience. \nSales rep not educated on they're own company policies and the worst company I have delt with on resolving a problem !\nI would drive two hours out of my way not to buy from them . My recommendation is anywhere but here !
2306	0	a	"Wowzers I will knowingly never eat food from here again.\n\nI placed an order via Grubhub and awaited for the food to arrive.  We were beyond starved and the moment it arrived  it was time to dig in.  \n\nI started with the salad, which was presented well and crisp.  After removing a layer we ate and continued our studies.  Time for more salad anyone???\n\nIt certainly was...until I looked down and noticed a dead FLY in the mix.  Ewww, how disgusting!!!\n\nI don't remember ordering extra insects in my salad.  It certainly had me wondering that if their quality control for food preparation was this horrid, which other insects could we have consumed in our bug salad.\n\nWe were rather grossed out by the ordeal we did not eat the pasta we ordered from them.\n\nI called the restaurant the next day, and they mentioned a manager would call me in a few minutes, after confirming my address and phone number.  No call or acknowledgement of the problem from management.  No thanks, I am unable to respect a business who operates without responsibility for their mistake and or \""mixup\""....\n\nIf you order food from them, be careful.  You might receive extra bits you did not ask for.\n\nI hope this is helpful for someone, I wouldn't want you to have the same experience."
2307	0	a	The short review....NO.  Don't order here.....\n\nI wasn't bummed out when it took two hours to arrive. (I live 2 miles away)\nI wasn't bummed out when it arrived cold. \nI wasn't bummed out when the delivery kid was a total asshole.\n\nI was pissed when I actually saw my food.  \n\nIf you like receiving a single chicken nugget slathered in Siracha when ordering 1/2 dozen hot wings your gonna love this place. (Literally a single chicken nugget about half the size of a golf ball)\n\nIf you love a measly portion of uncooked pasta and a single piece of meatball (read actual part of a meatball) slathered in store bought sauce, your probably gonna love this place.\n\nIf you like still frozen walmart cheesecake squirted with some kind of strawberry jam, your probably gonna love this place.\n\nThat and the fact that this was stupid expensive....I will continue ordering from Rosattis and more reputable places.\n\nThey did offer to give me a credit, but seriously why would I ever try this again....the service was bad, the food was much worse....
2308	0	a	"Okay, so I'm not typically the person who writes the bad review . . . but I've gotta say that I really wish I'd just had a bowl of cereal and called it a night.\n\nBoyfriend and I were exhausted from a rough day/week and pretty hungry. We ordered from 414 because they'd left a flier on our door. They had a special: an 18\"" pizza with one topping and garlic knots for $13.99. Not bad. We were told it would arrive in 35-45 minutes--also decent for a Thursday night 3 miles away.\n\nAn hour later I called back to ask what happened. Apparently they were pretty backed up, and they'd be sending an extra pizza along free of charge because of the wait. Okay, I figured, everyone gets backed up sometimes--not a big deal.\n\nBut I guess \""a little backed up\"" means \""Don't expect your pizza to show up for almost 2 hours.\"" And of course I was willing to forgive that, but then I opened the boxes. The pizzas were mangled, totally squished, as though someone had held the boxes under an arm on their way up to our door. (I'll post a photo.)\n\nOf course everything was cold--goes without saying. Hot, it would've been a decent pizza. The garlic knots were doughy and the dipping sauce tasted canned.\n\nAnd to add insult to injury, they'd charged us for two toppings instead of one because I asked for half mushrooms, half olives (which makes one whole pizza, so one topping, in my opinion--debatable). So I got overcharged.\n\nI'll be calling the manager tomorrow. At least the delivery kid was nice. And the only thing that could make this experience worse is if we wake up with food poisoning in the morning (pray for us)."
2309	1	a	Really great food and atmosphere! The cocktails are right on target! Fun and comfortable place to hang out with friends. Great service and friendly staff. I will definitely be back!
2310	1	a	"I've only been in for Happy Hour/Dinner, so I'll save a 5-star review for when I return later at night.\n\nThis place is very similar to \""Mabel's On Main,\"" but with a smaller food menu.\n\nSome tasty appetizers (the flatbreads are delicious), some great burgers, but not too much else.\n\nYou really want to go here for the awesome food/drink specials (Happy Hour goes until 7 and includes $2-$3 beers, as well as half-off cocktails.  YUM.\n\nThe place was pretty deserted when we came in, so hey, come check this place out!\nYou kind of have to search it out, but it's worth the effort.  \nENJOY!"
2311	1	a	I could see this place becoming the next big thing in Oldtown Scottsdale. My friends and I had so much fun dancing here.\n\nSuper classy, friendly staff, smells like truffle oil... What more could you want?\n\nBonus points: the manager (?) blond girl... bent over backwards tracking down my credit card for me. Thank you!!!!
2312	0	a	I give it two stars because there was a SUPER long wait for everything. I'm q bartender so I get the whole waiting on everything and how long each item takes, however, I definitely didn't appreciate having to wait 45 minutes for our checks. Not including how long the food wait was. Ryan was our server and he did his best but He definitely needed help. I'm pretty sure he was the only server and definitely need help, especially when the owner is too busy talking to Cougars instead of helping his staff. Oh and the owner told us rudely we needed to move so they could have a dance floor. Not coming back.
2313	1	a	Fun bar with great staff. There are a few hidden secrets that make for an entertaining evening.
2314	1	a	Beautiful decor - classy, cozy and very comfortable on a cool AZ evening!  They have a great happy hour - $5 wedge salad & 1/2 price cocktails.  I enjoyed the French 7018 and it was fantastic - gin, apricot and prosecco...how can you go wrong with that combination?  \n\nWe will definitely be back for more tasty cocktails and eats!
2315	0	a	Wellll first time here. Probably the last.\nBeen here 45 minutes. Food hasnt arrived. Asked the server about it. he had to ask what we ordered with a look on his face like we never ordered anything.\n\nWe ordered the brussel sprouts no almonds due to a huge food allergy. We shall see how that turns out.\n\n\nOtherwise the atmosphere is nice.\n\nSigh...
2316	1	a	Great lowlit upscale bar.  The drinks were delicious, the music was good.  Drinks can be a little over priced.
2317	1	a	Stopped into this place while staying at Hotel Valley Ho one night. The atmosphere was perfect. Fairly dark, huge luxious booths and a very classy feel. Prices were what should be expected at a place like this. We got lucky and came on service industry night. The filet bites and French dip sliders were incredible, flatbread pizza wasn't close to their level of excellence but wasn't bad. Service was great too! Thanks for a lovely evening that my girlfriend and I shared here.
2318	0	a	"A couple a girlfriends and I went to get our nails done here and were totally ripped off. They we're running a special for buy a \""signature\"" pedicure and get free gel polish on your nails for $35 total. The technician's gave us the wrong type of pedicure and a full manicure and we were charged over $50. While the place is clean and our technicians we're good, the owner manager was very pushy. He conceited to giving us 20% off after we complained multiple times, but it still came to $46. He would not give us the special price we asked for when we originally walked in and said we could get it next time. I don't live here and if I did there would definitely be no next time for me or the girls I was with."
2319	0	a	This guy did my nails and told me how awful my hands looked and I needed more manicures... Thanks guy, I get that you want me to get my nails done often, but I'm good.  He kept repeating it, like I love hearing that or something.\n\nDespite that comment, my nails looked nice when I left... That was short lived.\n\nI got them done on Wednesday, for a wedding on Sunday.  Sunday they looked okay... I'm not the bride so not a huge deal, but they began to peel off in sheets... Check out the pic I put up... One week later... I just can't even understand how gel nails last only a week. \n\nDon't go here.
2320	1	a	I have nothing but great things to say about icolor and this is now my go-to salon in Charlotte! I purchased a groupon for a shellac manicure and have been back for more mani's since. Have yet to try a pedicure though. \n\nPros:\nSuper friendly staff! They always go out of their way to talk to me and make me feel welcome. \nBrand new and super clean facility with a great nail bar! \nThey have this fun nail drying area with these fans that are made in America. I know that this point is random but I am assuming that they paid more to get an American made, fun and high quality fan system to dry your nails. #merica! \nWine/drinks included\nThey use OPI lotion instead of that generic pink tube!\nThey used a salt scrub on my hands that is usually an additional charge at other salons\nHuge selections of colors\nPolish lasted a normal time (not as long as midtown nails but still a very reasonable length)\nPrices are really competitive but the service and quality are way better! \n\nCons:\nSeriously, I cannot think of any!
2321	0	a	Relaxing atmosphere & service is great. Unfortunately, coffee is weak. Prices are very high.
2322	1	a	Great service always friendly. Have been several times even on opening day which was a zoo. Probably because Verrado has been starving (literally) for great coffee. The other place served the equivalent of Sanka. So happy you can now get a great drink on the way out and on the way back in. The quick grab and go food is amazing great price and flavorful. The Peanut Butter chocolate bacon (sounds weird)  donut is not to be missed. Trust me a party for your tastebuds.
2323	1	a	As a Seattle transplant, I was excited to find an actual coffee house (just because I'm from Seattle doesn't mean I like Starbucks) they have a decent beverage menu and my latte was fantastic! Reminded me of home.\n\nSuper cute atmosphere with a selection of books to read while you hang. They also have a kid friendly area. I'm assuming a manager chatted with me shortly after coming in. The staff seemed a bit.... Reserved I guess, but overall it's a nice little neighborhood spot to go too. \n\nI'll definitely be going back.
2324	0	a	"Verrado Coffee Co. is NOT dog friendly, despite their giant billboard off the freeway that says \""we heart dogs.\""\n\nMy fianc\u00e9 and I were driving with our 3 month old miniature dachshund puppy when we see the billboard for this (we thought) dog friendly coffee shop. We decided to stop to stretch our legs, get a coffee and enjoy the weather. There is a little park in the same parking lot which seemed nice, so our dog could run around a bit. Plus there was seating outside with dog water bowls, provided by the shop (the dog bowls even have cartoony dogs printed on them).  We picked up our dog, carried him in and we were waiting in line to order our coffee when an associate rudely exclaims, \""you can't have dogs in here!\"" So we said okay and my fianc\u00e9  left to sit outside with the puppy. THEN we were told we can't have our dog on the patio outside the coffee shop either! Ummm...what's up with the billboard and the doggy water bowls then???? It's not like I was trying to take my dog with me to Starbucks.  We stopped because Verrado Coffee Co. advertises themselves as being dog friendly!!!  Verrado Coffee Co. was rude, unwelcoming, and unfriendly. We won't be back here again."
2325	0	a	I ordered a large cold brew and it was just an iced drip brew. I wasn't even mad, mostly just very entertained. To be expected in Verrado, I suppose? I also like the little plaques on the wall that suggest how bike-friendly the neighborhood is, even though the bike lanes disappear on Verrado Way sometimes and everyone just rides on the sidewalks. I'm sure things will get better in five years or so when all those houses being constructed just north of the place have residents living in them or something.
2326	1	a	"Muscle Maker Grill....Their motto \""Great Food with Your Health in Mind\"".  So, let's see what's really going on.  \n\nI had a co-worker rave about this place years ago and at the time; they were just based on the East Coast.  Well, now they're here and I was curious if my bud knew what he was talking about. Their menu consists of wraps, soups, salads, burgers, sandwiches, pastas, protein shakes, and smoothies.  Also on their menu are the total calories for each dish.  \n\nI had two meals.\n\nMeal #1:  Premium Burger, Baked Potato, and an extra Chicken Breast.  There was nothing really special about the baked potato.  It was on the small side.  I thought that the burger was as juicy and as tasty as it gets for a 90% lean burger.  The highlight was the chicken breast. I eat a lot of chicken throughout the week.  In my opinion, Muscle Maker's was one of the best clean chicken breast that I've had in a while.  The meat was thick, plump, and grilled just right. \n\nMeal #2:  Rocky Balboa Wrap.  I only got this because one of the regulars and the employees suggested it.  I'm glad they did.  This wrap had chicken breast, turkey meatballs, cheese, and marinara.  This isn't the cleanest meal on their menu, but perfect if you're trying to up your calories and at the same time get your protein in.  Taste wise, this was pretty good.  \n\n\nThe restaurant is clean and they should be since they're new.  The staff is great and there are a lot of them.  This Muscle Maker is located near the 24 Hour Fitness, which drove a lot of post-work out diners here. So, it can get busy. Overall, I'm a fan will come back.  I have an office just 5 minutes from here and when it's time to pound some protein, it's nice to know that there's a place minutes from me. \n\n\nTIP:\n-They deliver ($2.50 charge)\n-Recommended by HealthyDiningFinder.com\n-Prices are average"
2327	0	a	Horrible! I ordered a simple pasta salad with a side of sweet potato fries. Pasta was hard with ONE coin slice of bagged frozen carrot and ONE small piece of bagged frozen broccoli. Sweet potatoes were soggy and covered in grease. Gross. It was so bad that when they took my plate and offered me a free meal coupon, I declined a free meal.
2328	0	a	I ordered the Godfather , the chicken tasted precooked and reheated . Super dry , I think if I would of chewed on the table it would be less tougher. The broccoli had that frozen taste yuck!! \nMy husband had the Rocky Balboa . It was bland and looked like it came out of a can of Alpo ... Waste of money ...
2329	1	a	This place is freakin awesome. Everything is cooked fresh to order and the food is delicious. Everyone info is super healthy and all of the nutrition info is right on the menu. All of the staff or super friendly and I even brought my kids loved it as well. We come here multiple times a week now. I'm so glad they opened finally!
2330	1	a	The food is great and the staff is extremely friendly! Clarissa makes sure that the food is always perfect and that all expectations are met! I will definitely continue to eat here several times a week!\n\nMy favorite wraps are the Rocky Balboa Wrap or the BBQ Wrap with Steak. I always ask for a side of Sweet Potato Fries. I've never been disappointed! Another favorite is the XXL Turkey Burger Wrap!
2331	0	a	Soooo... I've been waiting for this place to open since I go to 24hour Fitness right next door to it. The cashier was friendly and gave me some suggestions on the menu since it was my first time. Not to discriminate on age because I've seen 10 year olds throw down on the kitchen network, but I should've seen the young lady who is supposed to be a cook behind the grill as a bad sign. She looked like she was 12... Do you really know how to cook?\n\nI ended up getting the Tex Mex wrap with a side Caesar. I understand that the ingredients were supposed to be healthy, but the fat free sour cream and reduced fat cheese they put in the wrap was not very good. At least put the sour cream on the side so it's not all melted and gross in my wrap. The fat free Caesar dressing on my salad was thick and shiny: not yummy. I've never not finished a Caesar salad and I left this one alone. I've bought really good lowfat and fat free Caesar dressings at whole foods before- this one was a bad choice by the owner or chef.\n\nSuggestions to the owner: get a real chef or experienced cook.\n\nI doubt I'll give this place another chance.
2332	0	a	"I've been looking forward to this \""healthy\"" option in dining since I saw the signs go up. Perfectly placed in the same shopping center as 24 Hour Fitness. We walked in and were given menus and directed toward several options. I chose the fresh fish option and paid $12 for my selection. We were offered free T shirts which we declined and we took a seat. During the unusually long wait (as the restaurant was full of young staff but no customers) we started to notice lots of red flags. Young staff, young cooks, loud music. Music,which was turned up when one of the extra staff announced \""turn up, it's my jam\"" . The most outrageous moment was when one of the employees walked in with a giant bag of Popeyes Chicken. The chicken and biscuits were passed amongst all the employees who continued to eat behind the counter where my food was being prepared. When the girl cook was cutting open my frozen fish packet I decided to leave without my food or a refund. I had seen enough. Clearly the idea of healthy dinning is something they are not committed  to and I think they should have opened a fried chicken franchise. I wouldn't go back."
2333	0	a	The last time we were in, their friendliest server had been moved to the back, and the girl who took our order disappeared. We noticed that a salad had been made and was sitting waiting to be given out, but the order was to go, and it was made for dine in, the smoothie that I ordered had not been started. Nobody knew who the salad belonged to but we knew it was ours. One of the cooks called for our MIA server and when she didn't answer they went to find her in the back. She came out with ear buds plugged in to her head, I watched as she proceeded to finally make my smoothie. I was disappointed when the fruit was concentrated from a bottle.\nI felt it necessary to point this out due to the dramatic drop in customer service, If I came out of my office wearing ear buds and forgot about my clients I would surely be on a list for unemployment. \nOtherwise the food is still very good, especially the Turkey meatballs. There's still some obvious training to do, and we actually haven't been over there since.
2334	1	a	Fast amazing subs, and great customer service. Finally a Jimmy Johns that is close to me!!!
2335	1	a	I've been getting my lashes done for about 2.5 years now and up until about 3 months ago I was with another lash expert. However I developed an allergic reaction to the adhesive therfore she couldn't in good faith do my lashes anymore. Then I found Elizabeth whom offered to use a more sensitive adhesive on me and it did in fact improve my results however I still had a bit of a reaction. As a result Elizabeth took it upon herself to meet with her chemist whom developed an even more sensitive adhesive that Elizabeth did a patch test on me and to my great relief I had no adverse reaction! You can't get better customer service than that! I'm so grateful for such a caring and professional lash artist.
2336	1	a	My sister in law found this salon through her nail lady . I needed a fill for my lashes and made an appointment . She was easy to get into and her prices where very reasonable . I paid 65 for a lash fill and I will be back! She was sweet and very quick. Her work is beautiful and she has made a new client out of me. I would recommend her to all.
2337	1	a	Kind a pricey compared to the near by food lion but way better produce, beer, meat selection, and quality.
2338	1	a	This new location is perfect for those working near Nellis AFB! As I was driving somewhere else to eat, I saw that the new location was open. My friend and I immediately decided to change dinner plans! Capriotti's is a sandwich shop doing things right! Best sandwich on the menu is the Bobbie! It is thanksgiving in a sandwich...including turkey, cranberries, and stuffing. How awesome is it to be able to get the day-after-thanksgiving sandwich 24/7?! Yes, 24/7... The sandwich shop is you average sandwich place, but the Bobbie 24/7 makes this place a 4! \n\nHighly recommend trying this place....the chocolate chip cookie dough brownies are pretty perfect, too!
2339	0	a	I'm writing this review while I'm trying to enjoying my meal at this Capriotti's  location. The food is good. But the staff.... oh man.\n\nThere must be a shift change happening. (3:10pm). A few guys walked out of from behind the counter. Just clocked out I assume. The all sat down at a table right next to mine and started talking. Loud F bombs, yelling at the workers who were still on the clock from behind the counter and a general uncomfortable feeling about the topic of their conversation is how I enjoyed my meal. Oh... and Dr. PEPPER  comes out of the Coke dispenser. I love this sub chain, but I won't be back to this one. Staff reflects management.... and with that being said, I'm sure my Capastrami sandwich addiction will have me looking elsewhere. 2 stars.
2340	1	a	Came here today for another acai bowl and was not disappointed. This place deserves more yelp reviews so I suggest you go to restaurant.com and get a certificate for this place to give it a try.  I have no doubt you will be back  As usual the food was good and freshly prepared.  The service was friendly and informative.  We also took home 2 patiya or dragon fruit bowls.  I have never had this fruit before but look forward to eating it tomorrow morning.  This place is more than just a great place for bowls, smoothies and other nutritious food; it is also a wellness center which in my opinion tells me that the proprietor is conscious about the food her serves.
2341	0	a	"My first time coming to Spirit Bar was last week. 3 individuals were behind the counter. 2 women. 1 man. No one greeted me. Until I stood, read the menu above my head, and asked for assistance, noone spoke a word to me. They didn't even speak to each other. The energy in this place was DEPRESSING! They seemed unhappy. I smiled and asked one woman if she would like me to pay while the other woman made my smoothie as she was standing at the register. She never looked up at me and said, \""Not yet\"". She and the man exchanged a few words and then he disappeared in the back. I literally thought I was being punked. This place promotes wellness. It was very unimpressive and in my opinion the vibe in that place was anything but well. Ill never return. \n\nPositive note, the smoothie was decent."
2342	0	a	"I was happy to see a new place open in the neighborhood where I could get dinner and a beer when I work late.  One night I called about 8:50 to ask if they were still open to have dinner.  A pleasant lady on the phone said, \""Yes, our kitchen is open until 10.\"" I arrived about 9:10 and when I walked in the bartender said, \""The kitchen is just about to close, but we can make you something.\"" which didn't feel very inviting.  I was by myself and ordered a beer.  When the beer arrived I ordered some wings and a Classic Combo Pizza.  Yes, I failed to specify what size, but I was alone so I assumed the bartender would know I meant a 12\"" pizza.  When the pizza arrived it was huge!  He entered in a 16\"" pizza which the menu says serves 4-5!  When I got my bill it was $44 for one person.  I paid and left, but it kept bothering me that this guy entered in a large 16\"" pizza to up my bill...I was eating pizza for 4 days.  The pizza was delicious! but the service left a bad taste in my mouth."
2343	0	a	I have been their a few times to grab food and a beer.  They did a great job on the build out amazing bar with televisions everywhere and the food is top notch.  That's where it stops.  The service has a lot to be desired.  Recommend only for takeout.
2344	1	a	Great place. Perfect for lunch or dinner or just grabbing a drink. Great sports bar feel, but family friendly.
2345	1	a	I've know Kim for 5+ years and would recommend her to anyone.  I know a number of people personally who has used Kim for home purchases and they all have had 5 star experiences.  Kim is professional and trust worthy. See is also an absolute genuine person who cares about the people she works with.  \nBuying a house can be a stressful process and the character of Kimberly Wang makes her a perfect choice for anyone getting ready to take that step.
2346	1	a	Met Rogue Toys owner Steve at a Hot Wheels convention this past year, then saw him again at the recent Amazing Las Vegas Comic Con where he had famous Toy Hunter Jordan Hembrough at his booth.  Dude's got lots of cool stuff.\n\nFinally managed to visit Rogue Toys new store on Rainbow since I never get to downtown.  According to Steve this store is a bit more spacious then the original.  I love my toys, but I'm more of a modern collector than a vintage one, which is what Rogue Toys specializes in.  Don't get me wrong, I'm an 80's kid - I had toys of all types when I was younger...Voltron, M.A.S.K., GI Joe, Masters of the Universe, Go-Bots, Transformers, Robotech, DC Super Powers, Star Wars...I had lots of em' and enjoyed them immensely.  I did with toys what was supposed to be done with them, PLAY WITH THEM!  But I'm just not into going back for nostalgia so while I love revisiting the toys of my youth and playing with them again at Rogue Toys, I'm not interested in paying an arm and a leg to get most of them back.  I guess I'm now in a mode where I just like my toys still MIMP or 'mint in mint packaging' for you non toy geeks.  I just love to display my toys now.  Some I do have out of the box, but many of my rarer pieces?  Still unopened.\n\nWith that said, Rogue Toys is a nice mix of a store.  Some toys from this era, some toys from that era, a bunch of Lego stuff for the kiddies, and a massive collection of GI Joe and Star Wars toys.  Did you see that behemoth of a USS Flagg in there?  Enormous!  And complete as well.  Some of the Star Wars vintage stuff is a sight to behold too.  The spread is good with toys I still currently enjoy - Street Fighter, WWE, Marvel Universe, Marvel Legends, DC Universe, Funko, and some convention exclusives.  Only downer for me?  The prices are a tad on the high side.  I can find some of these convention pieces for better prices online, and will continue to do it that way.  You can try to haggle with Steve and he will budge a little bit if you're a regular, but the guy still has to make a small profit since he ain't in the retail business.  I bought a couple of things to help support the store but I just stop by usually to check out the old toys for kicks.  \n\nRogue Toys is clean, organized well, and can take care of most of your toy needs.  Especially if you need Steve to find something obscure that you just haven't been able to get you hands on.  He has all kinds of contacts and will probably be able to hook you up with that toy you absolutely need from yester-year.  Just remember you might just have to pony up some greenbacks!
2347	0	a	I may be the only one to have bad experiences with this place, but I'm never happy with them. I've been twice. Once, I never got my drink. I ordered at the front of a long line. Everyone in line after me got their drinks and left and I was still waiting. In an empty store. You'd think someone would've noticed me. Nope. Had to talk to the unfriendly girls at the counter and they didn't even apologize, they were too busy worrying about whether or not I paid for my drink. On my second trip there, I was left drinkless again because apparently someone else grabbed my drink, they said. So they remade it. Maybe they should try calling order names aloud ALL the time instead of only sometimes to avoid this situation? Anyways, nektar is always a disappointing hassle. Their juice is good but I'm never prepared to go through that kind of trauma and frustration for something I can make at home.
2348	0	a	"Update: went to nektar again the other day (hoping they'd prove me wrong about their customer service skills) and I probably stood in front of the register for about 10 minutes while 2 girls behind the counter talked and completely ignored me. Not even so much as a \""we'll be with you in a moment.\"" Just pretended I wasn't there."
2349	0	a	I really love their juices here but their customer service makes you not want to ever come back.  All 3 times I've been here the teenage girls act like they are doing you a favor by taking your order.  Usually takes 10+ minutes to get anything even if there is nobody else here.  They are just busy in the back gossiping.
2350	1	a	Love the atmosphere and coffee. Omelette veggies were undercooked but still fresh. Look forward to trying the desserts, huge selection. \n\nFree wifi??? Picking up an xfinity signal but it does not appear that Bartram has their own. Disappointing for a cafe as I would probably frequent it more often if it had wifi.
2351	1	a	Their dessert/pastry marketing is ON POINT here. Seriously, you walk in and it's like walking into heaven. I was probably drooling onto the floor. But it was a healthy day for me, so I skipped the sweets and went to the salads. \n\nI had the Mediterranean Salmon salad (pan-seared salmon, mixed greens, artichoke hearts, kalamata olives, sundried tomatoes, banana peppers, red onion, feta cheese, and greek feta vinaigrette dressing). They have a small and large size. I got the small, and to be honest, it was large in my opinion! So to have the big would be massive! Plus it's only $9.99 vs $13.99. \n\nI also loved the dressing and thought the salad was loaded with the good stuff, the toppings. Sometimes they scimp on the toppings, but they didn't. The salmon was a decent size and cooked perfectly too. \n\nLooking forward to visiting again... I'm coming back for the sweets, don't you worry!
2352	0	a	"Heard rave reviews on this bakery which I  was told was a bit upscale. Ordered a triamisu for my husband's  birthday.  Went to pick it up at the designated time and was presented with a FROZEN cake by the manager/baker and was told he \""never received my order\"".  Was told that Cake would be fine in an hour.  Changed my plans and served the cake 3 hours later than planned to be safe. .marscapone cheese..still frozen!  I was embarrassed in front of guest but more disappointed for my husband.  In all honesty. .flavorc was mediocre at best..more disappointment.   Although they will refund me, it doesn't make up for lack of service, disappointment, and a product that really wasn't up to par.  If people feel this is upscale, I feel badly that they obviously never had anything worthwhile to compare this too."
2353	1	a	I heard such great things about this place in the short time it has been open and was super pumped to check it out this morning. \n\nThe atmosphere is calm and inviting and there is a wonderful aroma of pastries throughout the cafe. There were so many to chose from ! They were displayed so beautifully when you first walk in, but I wanted something a little more satisfying than a pastry for breakfast. \n\nI placed my order at the register, took a number and chose a table. I ordered the bananas foster crepes. \n\nThey were awesome! Three crepes rolled up with a cream cheese icing filling, covered in bananas foster sauce and fresh bananas. So delicious! My one complaint is that I lost a lot of the cream cheese icing on the plate when cutting the crepes, so that was disappointing haha. \n\nService was also great! I can't wait to come back and try more of their amazing deserts and sweets!
2354	1	a	Que c'est chouette ! J'adore ce caf\u00e9 dans villeray :) c'est beau, le service est hyper agreable, meme les patisseries sont bonnes... Courrez-y !
2355	1	a	great little caf\u00e9 near Parc Jarry serving great coffee in a very kitsch looking place with an awesome surprise if you dare enter the basement.\n\non a very snowy evening, I made my way to the caf\u00e9 in question because they are one of the few who stay open late in the evening. a bit out of the way during winter but perfect spot during summer with the park nearby. took me a little while to find it as I actually walked past it. door was hidden behind a blanket, use to shield the snow away.. layout is definitely interesting. tables a bit everywhere, plenty of counter seats, a sofa chair by the door and a couple of those wooden school desks here and there. almost felt like sitting at one of those. basement was full so made my way to the back where there's a big squarish table and a Santa with sunglasses on.\n\nordered a cappuccino as well as a raisin danish. coffee was really good. a slight bitterness and acidity to it. Cup size was a bit small. as for the danish, slight sweetness, moist but a bit on the soft side. nevertheless, both hit the spot just right. \n\nif there's one thing I'd change it would be the coffee size and probably get the danish to be crispier.
2356	1	a	"L'emplacement du caf\u00e9 Oui mais non est d'entr\u00e9e de jeu effectivement aussi difficile \u00e0 trouver que le dit la rumeur. C\u00f4t\u00e9 sud de Jarry, en face de la pharmacie Uniprix, quelques rues \u00e0 l'Est de Saint Laurent. Un soir d'hiver, il n'y aura pour vous attirer que les belles lumi\u00e8res \u00e0 l'int\u00e9rieur et la couverture de piqu\u00e9 traditionnel qui garde la porte du froid, comme un gentil chien de garde aux couleurs multicolores. Pas d'enseigne. Pas de crieur non plus, mais on s'en fout, car ce qui compte est \u00e0 l'int\u00e9rieur.\n\nDerri\u00e8re le voile, une ambiance chaleureuse et soign\u00e9e, malgr\u00e9 la vocation manifeste de caf\u00e9 pour \u00e9tudiants ou hipsters \u00e9gar\u00e9s loin du Mile-End, qui transpara\u00eet dans le style faussement d\u00e9sordonn\u00e9, recompos\u00e9 et bigarr\u00e9 de l'endroit. En fait la d\u00e9coration est suffisamment model\u00e9e pour attirer le regard, divertissante pour d\u00e9tourner une conversation, intrigante pour susciter une visite plus approfondie.\n\nEt en terme de profondeurs, on fait rarement mieux. Les ordinateurs peuvent se poser sur toutes sortes de surfaces exigues, les pieds se perdrent sur deux \u00e9tages ou dans la boutique de produit h\u00e9t\u00e9roclites et curieux de l'espace adjacent, nomm\u00e9ment la boutique \""\u00a0Oui Manon\u00a0\"". D'aventure au sous-sol, vous pouvez m\u00eame vous asseoir dans une baignoire, mais je ne vous le conseille pas pour votre dos! \n\nSi le nom du commerce \""\u00a0Oui mais non\u00a0\"", sis dans un des plus vieux quartiers francophones de Montr\u00e9al, rappelle vaguement le penchant des Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois \u00e0 \""\u00a0ne jamais pencher suffisamment\u00a0\"" lors des consultations populaires que sont les r\u00e9f\u00e9rendums sur l'ind\u00e9pendance, soit par exc\u00e8s de soucis de compromis ou par crainte de chicanes inutiles, il r\u00e8gne ici une atmosph\u00e8re quelque peu franchouillarde, car beaucoup du fran\u00e7ais de France vient vous chatouiller les oreilles. Les immigrants fran\u00e7ais, peut-\u00eatre blas\u00e9s par l'ambiance format\u00e9e et on\u00e9reuse du Plateau Mont-Royal, viennent justement s'installer en deuxi\u00e8me lieu dans ces voisinages et chauffer les bancs de caf\u00e9 de ce genre, juste pour vous.\n\nLe cappuccino servi au comptoir est savoureux. Il y a effectivement quelque chose \u00e0 dire concernant la taille des portions mais je me garde une r\u00e9serve, tellement je suis charm\u00e9 par cette offre perdue dans un recoin de la ville en ayant tellement besoin. La foule agr\u00e9able pr\u00e9sente malgr\u00e9 le blizzard lors de ma visite confirme l'attrait du caf\u00e9. La musique, plut\u00f4t typique pour ce genre d'\u00e9tablissement, reste jeune,  et tr\u00e8s vari\u00e9e en style. L'accueil chaleureux qui perdure, comp\u00e9tent, demeurant au niveau du sol, ou des yeux, ne laisse rien \u00e0 d\u00e9sirer. \n\nIl y a du stationnement dans les rues transversales.

2357	0	a	It appears to be an older DQ, but not in the classic sense, more in the in need of some cosmetic upgrades (the ceiling looks like it may fall in soon) and maybe some AC improvements (the staff looked like they were sweating).\n\nWe ordered some basics, a small cone and a medium sundae. We received a medium cone and a small sundae. i was sad since i ordered the sundae but it wasn't important enough to have corrected.\n\nUnfortunately, being the closest DQ to home may get me back there, but if possible we'd seek out another one.
2358	1	a	I love a good chocolate malt shake, and theirs is awesome!
2359	0	a	Most definitely will not return here.   Tried to use a coupon from the Community Coupon Book for Buy One Get One Free menu item.   The cashier took off a $3.39 chicken sandwich.   Two minutes later he comes back out to say that his boss hates those coupons, and he would prefer that it had been taken off of the two hot dogs purchased which was going to increase our total by $1.92, and could we please pay the extra $1.92.   HORRIBLE customer service, and way to nickle and dime the customer.   Also, clearly can't do math.....the two hot dogs total $3.59!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!    How the hell do I owe more???????   My husband refused to let me dispute this, or I would have just asked for a full refund & walked out.   We will NEVER be back here, and others shouldn't go either.   Happy Holidays.
2360	0	a	"Bar area was great,  nice beer selection.  as long as you didn't want to get seated... After being told we were \""next \"" watched 3 couples get seated before the 2 of us. No acknowledgement that we waited much longer than our hour wait time.  When we final got seated it seemed an inconvenience.  We then left without dinner."
2361	1	a	We ate here on a Friday night about 5:30. The place was already packed, but our party of 5 was seated immediately. Our waitress and waiter in training were great, there seemed to be a lot of staff for the size of the place. There is also a patio that you could sit on, but no service on this night. The interior is small but nice, notice the beautiful stain glass flying hound above the door. We ordered beers that came out promptly (there is quite a list!) and then 2 perch dinners, a cod dinner, a patty melt, and an atomic sausage all with fries. Our food was also delivered promptly and was above average. Impressed on all the local ingredients used on their menu. Just a few negatives - hard to have a conversation because of the acoustics. It was also very cold, not sure if this was an A/C vent or the door opening and closing to the patio. Cole slaw served with fish pretty blah, none of us ate it. Other than that an enjoyable experience and we will definitely return. Previous reviewers that had poor service should give it another try. Oh, and they kept my water glass full, always a good thing for me.
2362	1	a	I like the vibe here!  Nice to have them in the Fitchburg neighborhood.  They seem to have good drink  selections.  I had a delicious ham and cheese sandwich! Looking forward to going back when they're not crazy busy.
2363	1	a	Service was excellent, especially for a new restaurant. I order the Schnitzel Platter, which came out a bit under-done but this was due to the thickness of the pork. I pointed it out and they quickly brought me a new one which was excellent. The server and management went above and beyond my expectation with rectifying the issue. We had started with the sausage sampler which was delicious. Their sauerkraut was some of the best I have ever had. My wife ordered the fish and chips, and the fish was done wonderfully, not greasy with the perfect amount of batter.  Great beer list as well as whiskeys at very reasonable prices.
2364	0	a	"Considering it's in a strip mall in the parking lot of a Super Target, I entered The Flying Hound with low expectations. But hunger and a crunch for time will make any place worthy of a try. Quite honestly, a stop at the Target food counter would've been more satisfying (albeit more shameful). The interior is decorated with some World Market prints and beer signs to make it feel like a faux pub. A thin veneer without anything to show underneath it. This carries forward to the food. The \""signature\"" (their words) pork schnitzel sandwich was completely underwhelming. Evidently they lost the \""pounded thin\"" aspect of schnitzel in translation. What I received was basically a breaded boneless pork chop accompanied with a slice of halfway melted muenster cheese and wilted arugula. The house onion gravy that accompanied it was separated by the time it came tableside. The sandwich was completely devoid of any flavor.  My daughter went with the grilled cheese. On paper, a combo of muenster and cheddar with a roasted garlic spread sounds solid, but sadly this isn't paper and the sandwich was nothing to write home about. The accompanying fries were undersalted and bland. \nYes, I know that the under represented southwest side of Madison is in need of a regular \""go-to\"" place for good drink and food. There isn't much around nearby and they are desperately in need. But sadly, The Flying Hound comes nowhere close to delivering  They are counting on convenience of proximity to bring in the crowds. This might work for awhile but it's not a recipe for long term success."
2365	0	a	The menu looked decent but the food itself was below average.  Service was below average,  with long waits and forgotten items.  Beer selection was decent.  Overall,  there are much better places to dine & drink.  I probably won't come back.
2366	0	a	My boyfriend and I went on a Thursday evening. When we entered the place was pretty crowded which we took as a good sign. However there was no hostess to greet us. When she did show up, there was no smile, barely a greeting, and we felt like a burden to her. However, on the way out, she was joined by a man, and both pleasantly wished us a good night. \n\nWe ordered the pretzel and mustard for an appetizer. The three mustards were good, but nothing super special. There was no indication what the flavors were. I ordered a ginger ale, which was served in a rocks glass (like you get a mixed drink in) and it was $2.50. The server told us they had to make it. Not that they brew their own, but they had to make it--I'm still not sure what that means. \n\nMy boyfriend is the beer drinker and he said that while the beer list is extensive, it doesn't have anything on it that you can't get in other places in Madison. \n\nWe both ordered the blue cheese and bacon burger. I asked for mine medium rare and it was more on the rare side of medium rare. The menu boasts that they get their meat fresh and locally, but all I tasted was the blue cheese. There was supposed to be spicy aioli--I didn't taste it or the bacon at all. The fries were nice and crispy--mostly. The food was just average; perhaps I would have a different opinion if I tried a different menu item, but I would assume with 1/4 of their menu being burgers, the place would be outstanding. \n\nThe waitstaff was average--nice enough but nothing spectacular. The place is probably pretty great for getting a beer and appetizer or a place to hang out after work, but it's not a place I would go back to for a meal. The ambiance is casual and the space is interesting. I'm hoping it will be better once they've gotten into a groove and worked out the opening jitters because it does have promise.
2367	1	a	Loved it!  Perfect atmosphere for outdoor or indoor dining.  Great selection of beers on tap, both local and around-the-globe.  The food was delicious and Pam, our waitress, shined!
2368	0	a	Tried new place. Inside nice has a pub feel to it. Large selection of beer both tap and bottle. Food not great. Ok but not great.  Had spicy citrus chicken. Really a piece of grilled chicken with very spicy wing sauce on it.  Too hot overpowered the taste of the chicken.  No free wi-fi.  Tampa Bay/Detroit game on. Asked for Brewer game to be turned on-which was weird Brewers in 1st and we are in Wisconsin. Leaning more toward not making this a regular stop.
2369	1	a	The four stars is simply because the beer here is excellent, but the food some what lacks in some aspects (both portions and taste). I've been here twice and the service is really quick. I definitely recommend to at least try some of the beers they have on tap (it's not made in house).
2370	0	a	"If I could give zero stars, I would! I've always had great experiences here and have been here multiple times but tonight was the last night I'll be coming for food or drinks! A new bartender who I have never seen approached our table after my friend had two drinks that were made with tonic water instead of soda water, two very different flavors. She told us she has been in the service industry for 20 years and knows the difference! Is she has really been in the service industry we would not have been attacked and insulted by her. When we told her she was being offensive her response was \""I'm from the Bronx, we alway sound angry!\"" Well her rude behavior and insults will keep me from being back, there are too many other great places to grab an after work drink!"
2371	1	a	The salads here are delicious! Also, there is a patio with a fire pit and, inside, there are cute bartenders. Need I say more? They also have a great selection of locally brewed beers. I will return!
2372	1	a	Food service ends at 10 p.m., so don't dawdle getting here. Just be sure to arrive before that and the food is good. European leaning menu for both food and beer but plenty of domestic brews. Really liking the double chocolate stout they're serving now. Options change regularly, so if you find one you like, get here often 'cause it won't be here for long!
2373	1	a	Great tap beers. Good food. Simple decor. Friendly staff. Good lunch spot for shopping day trip.
2374	0	a	This bar/ restaurant is......o.k.   We stopped on a Thursday\n evening, early.  The flying hound burger looked great but was a disappointment.  Dry, and while piled high with stuff, when the fried egg is the star there's something wrong.  Also ordered the mussels.  These were good, broth on them was light but with great flavor.  I appreciated that they toasted the bread but didn't feel the need to slather it up with butter before doing so.  this allowed it to be used to soak up the flavor at the bottom of the mussel bowl.  Both entrees came with fries....big disappointment also.  While the chance at really great fires was there.........please don't serve something that is wrinkled and hard from being under the heat lamp for to long.  Pre cooking seems to be the problem with his place.  Food service was so fast we really didn't have a chance to enjoy our drinks (which were good).  Please make my food fresh as it is ordered.  I would rather wait a few minutes more than be served sub par food.  Will not go back again.
2375	0	a	Disappointing, first time tonight. We went in a whim. We were greeted and seated. That was all well and good however it then took what felt like an eternity for our waitress. Long enough that we had decided what we wanted for an app and dinner. Cheese curds which I heard were great. I decided on the flying hound burger and fries my wife went with the spicy blue burger and fries and a glass of wine. We waited for a while but no curds.. After a while our food showed up. Still no curds.... Kind of the reason we went. They asked if we still wanted them but what was the point. We were starving so time to eat. I dug into the fries and I will say they were delicious. I the bit into my burger. Ummm how can I say this so you get true feel for it. It was like trying the bite through rubber (that should do) Trying to bite through the bun was a chore. Once I did I can say the actual meat was good. I should have asked for no arugula on it or taken it off but that's on me. My wife had a similar problem with the bun. She was also a little turned off as far as the flavor. She likes spice and there was none in her mind. She can handle some pretty spicy foods so it may have been spicy to someone but not up to her standards. Prices weren't bad but I expected better quality. At least we didn't get charged for the curds we didn't get. I think I will pass on ever needing to go back.
2376	0	a	Food is mediocre at best. Chili was all chili powder. The grilled cheese wasn't grilled it was toasted,bread dried out and hard. It was absolutely inedible. The staff not very polite at all. This is a restaurant that is a waste of MONEY and Time. Do not go here. It was our first time and will be our last
2377	0	a	I went in alone after work for a beer. The place is lovely with a nice pub feel and it's in a part of town where very nearby tavern options are limited. The beer selection was great and the servers were sweet. But, I ordered the poutine for dinner and it was gross. Gravy came on the side and was overpoweringly oniony. Worse, the fries were covered with provolone and OREGANO. Just pounds of oregano. Blech. I'd go again for just a beer, but will likely avoid the food.
2378	0	a	Yes, they have a large tap list, but that list gives no indication as to what size of beer you are ordering, just a type and a price. If everything came in pints, this would be fine, but when I was expecting a pint and got a half instead, suddenly the $5.5 price tag didn't seem so great.\n\nFurthermore the food is overpriced. I ordered the $15 bangers and mash, and received two tough, dry sausages and about 1.5 cups of potatoes with a thick gravy that barely did anything to moisten my food. \n\nThe decor is nice, but I'm not coming back here of my own choice
2379	1	a	Stopped here with the wife for a quick bite to eat and a beer (or two.)\n\nPrices: Reasonable.\nFood: Good.\nBeer Selection: Excellent.\n\nI found absolutely nothing unreasonably priced and the food was excellent. I will be back in the future. Also, some of the beer (or cider) selections come in a different glass than a pint (depending on alcohol content, I'm sure) so if you're concerned you won't be getting a full pint of whatever brew you order, simply ask the server who will tell you what size glass it comes in.\n\nVery easy.\n\nThe hound is becoming my choice for a hangout spot after work or just whenever I feel like having a beer. With good food and an ever-changing beer selection the wife and I will be frequenting.
2380	0	a	"I was so excited to try this place, it looked so promising. The service is decent. The d\u00e9cor was cool. The food is of terrible quality.\n\nI got the portobello burger. The portobello cap was cooked well enough, but the bun was dry as hell. I gave up on the bun after two bites and just ate the portobello and toppings. Speaking of which, they don't give you much for toppings. So when that menu says that something is \""topped with\"", they mean that they give you a sample for half your order. The fries they gave me were obviously the last of the basket short stubby bits and as such were poorly cooked. I couldn't believe that they would actually serve that to someone. \n\nThankfully they have at least one thing that can help to cover up their awful food. Their beer selection is very good (if you can manage to find a beer that they haven't run out of), so get enough beer to dull your taste buds."
2381	1	a	My husband and I have gone here a couple of times now. Each time we are pleased with the food and they have a great selection of beer. It is always changing so you can always try something new. \n\nThe dinner room has a pretty cool vibe, but is smaller. We have gone on off hours or had a reservation, but it is on the smaller side so I could see that on busy weekends there might be a wait.
2382	0	a	We went there a few months back and weren't impressed.  The service was OK at best, the d\u00e9cor OK and the place seemed clean.  The food was kinda boring.  My son had a burger that wasn't anything to write home about, my wife a blackened chicken sandwich that was salty and I had a Rueben that was also salty.  We also tried their French onion soup that was a complete disappointment.  It was a bunch of stale croutons with cheese on top with a very salty onion broth.  With all the restaurant choices  in the area I don't see a compelling reason to go back.
2383	1	a	I could not be happier with my ADAPT concealed firearms class today. I was originally planning to go to a range much closer to my house but had a horrible experience trying to register with them. I am so glad it didn't work out. The 45 min drive to the ADAPT class at the Clark County shooting park was well worth it and worth every single penny. There was 3 hours in the class room and 5 on the range. All of my questions were answered and I feel very well informed of the laws and regulation on conceal carrying. The range time was very informative and fun. I enjoyed all 3 instructors. They make it fun! I was never bored.  They are witty and engaging while being professional. I will recommend ADAPT to everyone. It was literally just how I was hoping it would be. Perfect. I feel lucky that I found ADAPT.
2384	1	a	Wow. Stopped in here 9/18 since it was National Burger day as a friend of mine told me about their burgers. The owner and chef Jeff welcomed us and brought us waters, menus, the beer, wine and cocktail lists. He also detailed out the style of the food of carefully blending midwest with southern comfort food. He then recommended the shrimp and grit cake appetizer as it perfectly represented his style. We immediately said yes and also ordered a beer (honey ale) and a cocktail (the Midway). Drinks arrived quickly followed by the shrimp and grit cake. I could have been happy eating those all night. Wow. Probably the best thing I've eaten this year. This is a must have! If you are there, even if just having a drink while waiting for a movie upstairs at the AMC, have this appetizer. The shrimp, amazingly seasoned and prepared perfectly, resting atop slices of andouille sausage and the buttermilk grit cake with a sauce I would have felt no shame in licking the plate clean not to miss any. Fortunately the grit cake was there to help do that. A perfect blend of flavors, spice, and baby tomatoes. A must have.\n\nWe ordered our entrees, the burger with bacon and the pork shoulder with collards. Upon arrival at the table, both were beautifully presented. The bun alone was a delight, with a silky smooth bronze tone and fluffy. The perfect size to encapsulate the burger and everything along with it. And it absorbed all those delicious juices I left dripping after every bite. The burger is at the top of my list. A fresh grind and hand formed.\n\nThe pork shoulder and collards over a bed of perfect mashed potatoes. The collards true to southern form, a touch of vinegar, paired with either the potatoes or the pork, mmm, can't wait to go back and have it again.\n\nI always say the biggest compliment I could give to a menu item or restaurant is that I would come back and have it again tomorrow. This place I could eat at every day.
2385	1	a	I went to dinner with my wife and 3 friends, and it was amazing. The food was absolutely delicious, the drinks  and the service were fast and great. The owner and head chef Jeff came out and visited with us. I definitely recommend TEN.
2386	1	a	I live in the area and wanted to try a new restaurant, so I was excited to find a new restaurant in the esplanade \n  \nThe menu is brief, but their food is outstanding.   The entrees are straight forward American dishes with a southern flare.  I got the pulled pork and the gf ordered the pot roast, both were delicious. \n\nThe waitress seemed like it was her first waiting job.  She didn't pour the wine how they are supposed to-letting the guy taste and approve then pouring the females glass.  She also seemed a little nervous/uncomfortable.  But, whatever, not a big deal. \n\nThe chef/owner did personally come out and greet all the customers.  It was a really nice personal touch, and it's always nice to see someone taking pride in their business.  \n\nOverall a great experience, I would like to see an expanded menu in the future, but certainly nothing wrong with offering what you make best
2387	1	a	I can't believe it took me so long to try this restaurant. It's in the best location, great vibe,  and I will be back soon.  Next time I'm trying the pulled pork sandwich.
2388	1	a	Awesome service and food.  Barbecue sandwich is one of the best I've had.  Also try the hush puppies.  Prices are great.
2389	1	a	Very good food. Parking is a pain, but they do validate the parking if you bring your ticket.
2390	1	a	"Epic. That's the only word I can use to describe my dinner tonight. Amazing service, incredible food, best birthday dinner ever! There were a few mishaps along the way (like my breakfast burger missing it's bacon and egg... oh dear), but the chef more than made up for it in the end.\n\nHappy hour is from 4-6pm and is always a fantastic deal at Ten. I recommend the cucumber gimlet and any of the appetizers, as they're all half off. Living Social is also offering a great deal on a dinner for two! Tonight, I had the hush puppies and the shrimp on grit cake. The hush puppies were perfectly crisp, topped with bacon and cheese crumbles, and served alongside a delicious remoulade. The shrimp and grit cake is definitely \""crack on a plate,\"" but don't forget to ask for bread service so you can sop up every drop of buttery goodness after the shrimp, sausage, tomatoes, and grit cake are long gone.\n\nFor the entrees, I ordered a breakfast burger and the pot roast. The burger was delicious but the pot roast was simply incredible. I told the chef that his pot roast was so amazing that I'd like to see it slapped on a grilled cheese sandwich in the future. As the meal wound down, the chef delivered a small plate to the table with two little triangles of pot roast grilled cheese. As full as I already was, I didn't care. I downed the grilled cheese and just about died. I thought my perfect meal was over when the server surprised me with a birthday PB&J a la mode for dessert. I mean, seriously???\n\nAs I rolled out of Ten a fat and happy birthday girl, I couldn't help but begin planning my next visit back. Perhaps next time I'll hassle the chef into making me a BLT with bacon, lettuce, fried green tomatoes, and that magical remoulade..."
2391	1	a	Amazing little spot my brother found on yelp after our massage appointment.\n\nI'm visiting from Hawaii and Ten was so delightfully refreshing with flavorful heart warming food. \n\nI ordered the pork shoulder and it was so juicy and tender. I usually like to add Sriracha on my meat dishes; which the waitress was nice enough to provide but after taking one bite of my dish... It was so yummy and flavorful that I didn't need to add anything. \n\nAlso, love industrial interiors with brick walls. I can't wait to visit this place again when I'm back in AZ!
2392	1	a	Great drinks, fun pace the staff is friendly very engaging. They have a good beer selection that is very unique. Good place to go for drinks and some decent food.
2393	1	a	I called posar\u00e9 summerlin to see about getting a baylage service done on my hair. The receptionist immediately recommended Courtney, and I'm so glad she did! Courtney came in on her day off to do my hair and I am so so grateful. The color is absolutely gorgeous. She really knows what she's doing. I get compliments daily. The service was very affordable, all things considered. I spent around $120 without tip. But I recommend tipping her generously, because her work is just superb. I will recommend posar\u00e9 summerlin and Courtney to EVERYONE.
2394	1	a	"Listen, I party. A lot.  And I don't drink and drive.  I will however, pay off an imaginary DUI by taking Uber to and from places each time I go out.  \n\nOn the evening of Halloween, my wife and I decided to party on Mill.  We knew that traffic would be terrible, as well as any overnight parking.  And worse, surge rates for Uber would be off the charts.  We both felt that getting a local hotel would be the best option.  \n\nAfter an exhaustive search, I came across the newly remodeled Graduate Tempe.  It was a bit more than the other hotels, but the location worked out well.\n\nHere is what was great about it, from start to finish:\n\n-- The website was easy to navigate.\n-- The lobby was completely redesigned and looked fantastic.\n-- The staff was friendly.  Paid attention to details, and even had a bellhop waiting to see if we needed help up to the room.\n-- The school theme was well thought out.  Even the room key cards look like old student ID's.  Hotel stationary looks like composition notebooks, and instead of hotel pens, #2 pencils.\n-- I freak out about cleanliness everywhere I go. The room was flawless.  From the bedding, to the bathroom, to the towels.\n-- All new everything! I don't mean to call out other local boutique hotels in the valley (Clarendon, El Dorado, etc.) but everything has been replaced in the rooms. Not just fresh paint, but the chairs, paintings, bedding, T.V., etc.  \n\nHere is what I would have changed:\n\n-- I didn't get a chance to really enjoy the room or the balcony.  We were there for such a short time. \n-- The same goes for trying out the newly refurbished \""Normal Diner,\"" which replaced the IHOP that had been there for years.  \n\nBoth of those things are my fault, though.\n\nIt was a fantastic looking hotel that I would love to go back to.  I usually stay at hotels based on price, and look forward to some great deals from The Graduate.\n\nEven at a regular room rate, you cannot go wrong with this hotel. Five stars for location, staff, amenities, and cleanliness."
2395	1	a	Only one word comes to mind when I think about this hotel - BOOM! The room and decor were enough for 4 stars, but the staff really cranked up the rating. Best hospitality staff I have ever encountered! Be sure to check out the restaurant for some crazy drinks you would never think of making on your own.
2396	1	a	Large, clean rooms.  Very comfortable beds.  Fridge in room.  Bathroom is large and well stocked.  Plenty of accessible outlets.  Very enjoyable stay, would return again.\nKeurig machine needed cleaning, tried to make tea and the hot water was nasty.\nFitness center - single treadmill, bike, and elliptical as well as free weights was clean,new and well maintained.\nThe Normal Diner (connected to the hotel) had excellent meals and service.
2397	0	a	"I only left one star, because there wasn't an option lower than this.  I'm not a picky traveler, but expect hotels (much like any other business in the service industry) would provide a good service, well kept rooms, and ALWAYS pay attention to detail.\n\nThis hotel doesn't pay attention to detail.  I read one post that said they provide free red bull (they don't).  They have a small cooler (12\""x12\"") with red bull in it, but they \""lost the key\"".  Then why not take it out of the lobby?\n\nWhen I arrived to my room, this is what I discovered.  Sure it appears trendy from the pictures, but the materials and furnishings resemble something purchased from a garage sale.  Don't get me wrong, I LOVE garage sales, but these items resemble something that crazy Uncle Eddy threw out of his RV on his way to the Griswalds for Christmas dinner.\n\nThe short list of things wrong with my room were the following:\n\nThe bathroom mirror wasn't attached to the wall; the provided bottle of body was completely EMPTY; the safe for the room was small and not fastened down to anything.  So locking away valuables is a good idea, but a 9lb safe is easy to pick up and leave a room with.  The small provided fridge didn't work; there were only 2 small drawers to use for clothing; the toilet seat was barely bolted to the toilet; the TV didn't work, nor did the outlet by the bed for changing my cell phone.  Lastly, when logging into their wifi, it said my room \""didn't exist\"".\n\nThey make the online website navigation and pictures look good.  However, the real thing is not what you would expect.  We checked out after 2 days of an 8 day vacation and went to a Holiday Inn Express.  The Holiday Inn was much nicer, and even less expensive.\n\nAgain, I'm not a picky traveler.  I only expect that businesses focus on their core competency, and not just rape a business for cash.  This is clearly what's happening here.  Take the $, and put a very limited amount back into an operating budget.  I like giving smaller guys the benefit of the doubt, but this one stung, and I won't be staying here again.\n\nThey also refused to refund my $.  Which tells me they don't care about your experience, or repeat business.  All they want to do is take the cash and run."
2398	1	a	Just had a bikini and eyebrow wax with Carla. She was great and SUPER fast (which is exactly how I like it). She was extremely through and did a really good job. Wish she was my local gal but we were just passing through on vacation.
2399	0	a	$32 dollars for a pizza with no sauce in the middle. Need I say more. Too bad, I wish this place was better since I can walk there from my home. Huge miss for Rosatis in DC Ranch.
2400	0	a	Walked into the restaurant last night (me on crutches). Waited several minutes to be seated, and when no one acknowledged us, we seated ourselves on the patio. Two different waitresses came out to check on other tables, but never came over to us. My husband went inside to try to tell someone (anyone!) that we were waiting, to no avail. After 20 minutes, we got up and left. There is no excuse for this, especially when the place is almost empty. We won't be back.
2401	1	a	Wow!  Pizza was great and beer was cold.  Definitely coming back to take advantage of all of the games on their big screen TVs.\nHappy hour pricing is amazing and great menu.
2402	1	a	I came in and picked up a large pan pizza with pepperoni. The cookie dough tempted me so I added on some of that and some thick cheesy bread. The girl at the register also made my pizza and she made it fresh in front of me and asked me if it looked alright which I did. My wife baked the pizza, cheesy bread, and chocolate chip cookies and it all came out good. The pan pizza was nice and thick but the bottom got a little black from the oil or butter under the pizza. If you bake the pan pizza make sure and check it after 10  minutes. The thicker cheesy bread they now have is something my wife said she could just eat as a meal by themselves. The cheesy bead was a big hit.
2403	1	a	I'm a fan of Papa Murphy's. Some people are weird about buying pizza and sides that they have to bake at home, but that's just some people being weird. There is usually some type of deal going on and they send coupons in the mail, so with any type of deal it is really worth it considering what a frozen pizza costs and tastes like. You can call your order ahead or stop in and watch them make it fresh. You can choose lighter or extra sauce, cheese and toppings to customize the pizza to your liking. The employees inside this Papa Murphy's are friendly and helpful with going over specials, but when I went on grand opening day, the people there from Sunny 106.5 were very rude and didn't help represent Papa Murphy's well. I was actually relieved to find out it was the radio station being so rude and not the actual Papa Murphy's employees because it would have detoured me from going back. I did score a free pizza (the very last one, nice!) because they were giving out 100 free pizzas to customers that day. \n\nThey have pizzas of all shapes and sizes. They have the mini-murph pizza kit to take home so your kids can put together a pizza for themselves and then see their creation after it bakes. The pizzas also come in signature, pan, delite and stuffed crusts. Most of the pizzas bake at 425 and only take around 10 minutes aside from the stuffed pizza which takes around 25 minutes. The pan pizza is definitely good, but beware when cooking the pan pizza and keep your eye on it because there is butter or something at the bottom of that one and it can burn easy if you let it go too long and when you take the pan pizza out of the oven it's really hot, so let it stand for 5 minutes before slicing. The cheesy bread comes in regular and thicker sizes, both being equally delicious. With a coupon I usually pay about $6 or $7 for a pizza and adding 2 sides it's $6, not including the thicker cheesy bread. One thing I tried on my last visit that I hadn't before is the s'mores dessert pizza. Wow that thing was good! I preferred the s'mores pizza much more than the chocolate chip cookie dough they offer and it is a great price as one of the 2 sides you can pick. My hubby likes the cookie dough here, but I personally do not. If you are signed up for the e-club they usually send you a coupon for free cookie dough on your birthday. They also have pumpkin shaped pizzas at Halloween time and heart shaped pizzas for Valentine's Day, usually at a special price that I like to pick up. All in all this is a decent take-n-bake pizza spot.
2404	1	a	Pizza made in the store and then you take it home to cook!  Affordable and lots of toppings! I like it and they don't scrimp on the ingredients!  Only takes about 15 minutes to cook up and enjoy at home.
2405	1	a	"It's a donut shop.  They have other stuff, too.  But basically it's a donut shop.  Brand new location.  I do my best not to eat donuts because they are soooo not good for me.  But if I'm going to have a donut, Bosa is the one.\n\nI've not tried the boba drinks nor their \""sandwiches\"".  My wife likes them.  I can't help but think of the scene from \""Seeking a Friend for the End of the World\"" where they have a burger with a donut bun.  :-)  But, no, they don't use donuts as buns here, so fret not!  All I can say is they do have my wife's seal of approval.\n\nAnyway...donuts, coffee and tea, boba drinks, and breakfast and lunch sandwiches.  This is what they do.  Their donuts are probably the best in town, or at least the best I've found so far.  You pay a bit more than grocery store donuts, but it's not that much more and these are MUCH better."
2406	0	a	Counting error once, shame on you. Twice, shame on me. Great donuts, I mean fantastic but for the price should be a bakers dozen but certainly 11 two days in a row is crazy. You've got the donuts down now just work on the counting.
2407	0	a	"This use to known as the former \"" View Bar \"" which was awesome! !! It was actually one of our must visit bars every time we would be out in Vegas. Not anymore. \n\nThe replace is now Lobby Bar. This place was very disappointing. We walked in at about 10 pm on a Friday night. Not many people there at all. We walked past 2 waitresses who were just hanging out talking. We sat ourselves at the end of the lounge facing the Aria lobby entrance so we can people watch and enjoy the lounge. We sat there for 20 minutes and no one even bothered to approach us and take our order. The drinks are also different now as well as the employees. No familiar faces at all. Looks like everyone jumped ship when this became Lobby Bar and I don't blame them. Bring View Bar back and the great service with the great drink menu. We would be back. But until then, we will continue walking past Lobby Bar onto the following bar that sits in the casino with live music. View bar was great. Had the piano player and relaxing atmosphere."
2408	0	a	Completely agree with the other reviewer. We walked in past the waitress. Sat down at the front sofa and sat for 20 minutes before my husband finally walked up to the bar to get us drinks. Mind you, there were only 4 other people in the lounge at the time. He found out the don't sell cigars anymore. He walked to the shop to get a cigar while I waited. Still no waitress. We have been here now for at least 45 minutes and the waitress has YET to come over to offer us the snack mix she has placed on every table around us for the people that came in after us or to see if we needed anything else. Like a refill on my drink that has been empty for the last 15 minutes. My husband even tried to flag her down snd she ignored us. Worst service we've ever had at the Aria in the past 4-5 years of coming here. Will never come back. This girl must go home with $20 in tips at the end of the night by the level of service she offers.
2409	0	a	"After a delicious meal at Julians. we decided to move across the restaurant to the \""lobby bar\"" the bar is a very comfy lounge with plush seats and plenty of tables. We seated ourselves and waited for a cocktail waitress to come take our order. After 2 or 3 minutes a girl approached us to give us a menu and said \""she'll be right with you\"" waited again for another 10 minutes, place was not packed, there were only another 3 tables so I decided to go to the bar myself and order, no big deal. The BIG deal now is that the second girl came to our area where there was a table directly next to us she came back to them about 3 times asking if all was fine, she proceeded to also ask the other 2 tables all the while ignoring us completely. The second time I came back with drinks, my friend said the waitress just came and asked if we were done with the menu and took it. When she was yet again asking our neighbors if all was good we called her over and asked her why she was giving everyone else service but us. She proceeded to tell us she was sorry but she was the only one working and kept seeing us with drinks and thought we were okay and that she thought someone else was helping us....UM YOU JUST SAID YOU WERE THE ONLY ONE WORKING THAT LOBBY BAR?!? she put her foot in her own mouth and that right there told me all I need to know. I wish I could remember her name but she's thin and bow legged. With the high prices charged for drinks there I would also expect much better service, exceptional service.\n\nBy the way we were there for over an hour.\n\nDefinitely on my sh!t list and won't be back."
2410	1	a	Yum, yum, yum.  Stopped by chance today and was pleased to find the NEW El Sombrero had undergone a change of ownership and a facelift.  Menu is new as the focus is on an upscale Mexican, but don't let that stop you.  Started with a freshly made guacamole.  It had the right amount of heat with a little bit of chunkiness that went perfectly with the complimentary chips.  I had the Costillas en Salsa Verde (pork ribs with green sauce).  I am sucker for a good green chile.  The sauce was not too spicy and the rib meat fell off the bones.  Served perfectly with charro beans and rice.  My partner had Chicken Mole.  Wow!  I had a taste and know that is what I am ordering next time.  The mole was smoky with a delicate peanut flavor.  Irma told me they make their own mole by grinding peanuts and adding a delicious combination of spices.  Jose was our server who made us feel at home and made sure we were taken care of.  They just opened 2 days ago and are still getting in the swing, but this place is very promising.  They may need to do something to soundproof the room which got a little loud.  Maybe some rugs will help.
2411	1	a	I cannot say enough about this new remodeled look and feel! The environment is very unique and with plenty of character. The chef's menu cannot be duplicated. It is fantastic and everything I tried from the bean dip to the halibut was outstanding!\n\nA must visit continuously from here on out! \nI would also recommend this as a great date place. Intimate and sexy!
2412	0	a	I really want to like this place. I went to the old El Sombrero and enjoyed it but after reading great reviews here and on Facebook I was looking forward to trying out the new place. \n\nI called to see what the hours were and was advised to make a reservation. We came, party of 2, and found half of the 14 tables empty. After waiting for about 60 seconds at the empty host booth, we were finally seated by the busser. \n\nThe service was exceedingly slow by the server. We waited about 5-10 minutes after an introduction to ask questions about the menu and order. It was another 10 minutes before we were notified that the soup we ordered wasn't available. When our food came it looked incomplete, but after a couple minutes we started eating. Turns out the bus person made an honest mistake but it wasn't caught by the server in time so 95% of another table's order ended up in the trash. No check-in after our proper order arrived. 5 minute wait from getting our check  to getting the card charged. There were 5 other tables. The server blamed the slowness of the food on a missing cook but there is no excuse for such slow attention at the table. The busser was the only person who I'd say was sufficiently doing their job. \n\nThe food was good, with the potential to be great. The price point is a little high, but the chips are spiced and the salsa is great. We had the tradicional combo and the meats were solid, sauces were decent. We had some fries that were crispy and nicely salted and the rice and beans were fine. We avoided the enchiladas because 14 bucks with no rice and beans is just ridiculous. \n\nThe decor is simple and modern with lots of mirrors to open up the small space. Smooth electronic music was playing that made it feel like Red Rock Station, but I personally like the eclectic homey feel the old place had or Casa Don Juan has. \n\nI hope they tweak the menu, prices and especially the service, cause this spot could be great
2413	0	a	Beware of what may be in your salsa!!\nI work downtown and go out to lunch everyday. I was so happy to hear that El Sombrero had reopened.  So I invited a coworker to go with me to tryout the new menu. The restaurant has been completely \nredone. It looks really nice. The waiter promptly arrived at our table with the complimentary chips and salsa. We started to eat the chips and salsa when my friend felt something at the bottom of the salsa bowl.\nTo our surprise it was a stick of chalk  We called the waiter to tell him about it. He pick up the chalk piece and the bowl of salsa without saying a word. He came back with a new bowl of salsa. My coworker and I were stunned. He never said Sorry.\nIt was as if nothing had ever happened.\nAt the end of our meal we thought that the manager would stop by and say something but no one did. \nI was very disappointed with the service. It really overshadow the food. My order number was #836 (10/6/14).
2414	1	a	I would have to say this Mexican food is very good, it would be like having my own family in the kitchen. Try the salad with jicama and mango, so good. What a change from what this restaurant used to taste like. Very classy and stylish inside.
2415	1	a	The new incarnation of El Sombrero is not to be missed. I've been here 5 times since new ownership took over - and if I didn't travel so much for work I'd come at least 3 or 4 times a week, if not daily. \n\nThe menu is elevated, well prepared, well conceived Mexican. The price points are reasonable or better (they've been favorably adjusted since opening). The menu comprises excellently executed traditional Mexican items, using very fresh, well-sourced ingredients. \n\nThe 4-star review (I'd go 4.5 if possible on Yelp) is because of a few minor elements, that, together, add up to a half-point knockoff: the serviceware is great - though the deuce tables don't really accommodate its size well; the table salsa is delicious but often benefits from a bit of salt (this seems dependent on who makes it as this is not always the case); the guacamole is some of the best in the Valley  - thought it suffers from (sometimes) a lack of salt and it being served cold - it should be room temp. (It should be noted that the LV health department often has issues with room temp items so it could be that - the health department is as clueless as they think they're on.)\n\nAll told, these are fairly minor points. The service is consistently excellent; the sauces are delicious; the proteins (or the vegetarian options - and there are many) are wonderfully varied (don't miss the skirt steak, the vegetarian or meat enchiladas, among others), the chile relleno (vegetarian or with chicken or brisket). \n\nAnd don't miss the salads. Absolutely delicious salads (large enough for two to share). The piquillo pepper ap is a must as well. \n\nSumming up, El Sombrero should at the very least be a stop on your food travel  itinerary in Las Vegas. And, quite possibly, a regular go-to spot. It's become one of mine.
2416	1	a	Previously known as the oldest restaurant in town, El Sombrero can now lay claim to some of the best Mexican food in the valley thanks to new ownership and new chef -- Oscar Sanchez, formerly of Envy the Steakhouse. \n\nDining here on a Saturday afternoon, we were treated to an excellent array of dishes, starting with the well balanced quesillo fondue Mexicano ($12), with its blend of creamy cheeses, peppers providing hints of heat in a sauce with a touch of acidity. Following that was an excellent rendition of calamari -- the spicy calamari a la brasa ($13). Different from your typical restaurant version in that it wasn't breaded and fried, this charbroiled version delivered a subtle heat that lingered on the tongue. \n\nEl Sombrero has plenty of familiar dishes, like tacos, burritos, and tamales. But their food shows a passion and refinement that separates it from other spots. The depth in the roasted garlic tomatillo sauce in the tamal  de pollo ($14) elevates the dish and makes it anything but common. \n\nThe deft touch of the chefs is evident in their platters of meats. A filet, rib eye, and braised pork rib make up the Del Patron ($35). Both the filet and rib eye showcased a nice char and ample seasoning, while the pork unfortunately fell flat with its tough meat. A trio of sauces accompanied the platter but the beef hardly needed it. Side dishes proved to be as good as the proteins. The potatoes were excellent and the cream corn was a showstopper -- the type of dish that will leave a lasting impression.\n\nThe highlight of the meal, however, was the mole semana santa ($16). Braised, bone-in chicken was smothered in a mole sauce comprised of more spices than you'll ever pick out. It's a blend of heat and smoke with hints of bitterness and ever so subtle sweetness  that will awaken you palate.\n\nEnding the meal was a dulce de leche bread pudding dense and moist from a rich custard that packed enough sweetness to end the meal on a sweet note.\n\nThis isn't the Mexican food found at lesser restaurants or chains. Dishes aren't over-sauced, they're perfectly seasoned, executed with the precision and passion that is superior to anything else of its kind in town.
2417	1	a	I absolutely loved this place! My husband and I came here for my birthday and I have to say that everything about it was amazing! The ambiance was breathtaking and the service was simply great. And of course, the food was delicious! I would definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone who is looking for great food along with a modern atmosphere!
2418	1	a	Delicious! I fell in love with Cafe Rio while attending Brigham Young University. So glad to have a location in Chandler. Love anything with the sweet barbacoa pork. Thanks to the friendly staff at the grand opening!
2419	1	a	Cafe rio is amazing! Everything to the fresh hand made tortillas, the queso dip, house sauce and the sweet pork are to die for! A must try and you'll fall in love!
2420	0	a	This place is 0 for 3 so far. The first time I ate here was the day after it opened so the place was packed but we had heard so many good things that we decided to wait out the line but order our food to go. When we finally made our way up to where you order they asked us the initial order questions but then continued to ask us what we wanted on our burritos even though the line hadn't moved. To accurately paint the picture for you- I am 5 foot tall standing behind 5 1/2 foot sneeze guard glass as the person making my food yells from the other end of the very loud and very crowded restaurant what else I want on my burrito. Unfortunately at this point the person making our order decides to guess what we want and completely screwed up our nacho order and was visibly frustrated when we finally made our way to our food and explained that is not what we ordered. The only reason we came back the second time is because our parents really enjoyed the San Tan location and wanted to try this location. Again, as we made our way down the line they would add items to our food before we even had the chance to say that we didn't want that. My mother in law is lactose intolerant and didn't even get a chance to say no cheese before they added a heaping handful into her burrito and then received an exaggerated sigh when she told them no cheese and they had to start over. Today my family decided to meet at this location again and even though they were not busy they still could not get it right. My husband ordered no tortilla in his salad but even though the person taking his order nodded that they understood still started the salad with a tortilla at the bottom. My husband didn't mention it because it wasn't that big of a deal but again as my mother in law ordered her burrito with no cheese they still had to remake it. To clarify: my mother in law said I would like a chicken burrito with out cheese then watched him start the burrito knowing he would probably still add cheese hoping she could catch him reaching for it but he moved through her order so quickly that even though she was ready for it she couldn't catch him. How does this place stay in business if they keeping having to remake orders? \n\nPros: I love fast casual concept restaurants and the food here is good.\n\nCons: they rush through your order and do not pay attention to what you actually want - or do not want-  in your food.
2421	0	a	"Lets Keep this short and sweet:\nFood = OUTSANDING A+\nCustomer service = B - (at best)\nFacility cleanliness = A from what I could see\nNickel and diming you to death = they are true experts at.\nTo get your plate just the way you want it with all the \""EXTRAs\"" plan on spending $12 per plate\nExtras include:\nSalsa on tacos\nCheese\nSour cream\nGuacamole\nChips and salsa are nearly $5 (OUCH) (little baby cups of salsa too btw.)\nThe plate is a good size and the food is good but I left feeling like the opportunist of this business are exploiting their customers on a daily basis."
2422	0	a	I had the bean and cheese burrito. It was not flavorful and was rather salty - and I slat and pepper almost everything. The queso side for the chips was also salty, a little sweet, and overall underwhelming. The tortillas are fresh made and probably the best pare of the meal. \n\n service was quick and the dining are serviceable if not super comfortable. Family friendly and fairly busy so people seem to like this place. I wouldn't make it a regular spot. Chipotle is superior in my opinion.
2423	0	a	I definitely got a sodium overdose at this place.  I got the chicken enchiladas which seemed like a good idea at the time.  The sauce and the salsa had so much salt in it. I could barely tell the taste of the dish.   The tortilla and chicken are fine, but I just couldn't get over how salty everything is. \n\nThe sides were rice and black beans.  The beans good, but Just average. But probably I have this place a 2 star instead of 1. The rice was really hard. They definitely undercooked it. \n\nThe tres leches dessert was actually not bad. It's a bit sweet, but not too much. Not like how the enchiladas were salty.  They even delivered it to our table even though this is a fast food place. \n\nAnother note: it's set up like Chiptole stores, but the glass in front of the food preparers is a bit high. Found that I had to tippy toe so the guy could here me better.
2424	0	a	This place food is over salted and the staff here are incometent. This is NOT a substitute to chipotle.
2425	1	a	First time coming here. They've been open for less than a week and I would have never known unless they hadn't told me. I had an almost hour long pedicure which is so rare! What a treat this place is. The staff is very sweet. Polish colors are updated for the season and great brands like OPI, essie, etc. This is the place to come for a truly pampering experience.
2426	1	a	Nice and clean!!!!!!
2427	1	a	I moved here 3 months ago and have struggled with finding a decent nail spa. This one takes the first place prize. I don't think I've ever had a better pedicure. Hot stone massage with all pedicures. Super accommodating, kind, offered me water, asked me how much time I had in case my mani and pedi didn't need to be done at the same time. Very very professional and CLEAN!!  Get over here and get the best service in North Phoenix!
2428	1	a	Great salon! Very relaxing and you do not feel rushed through.   Tracy is wonderful ! I highly recommend!
2429	1	a	Yippee I found the best girls in North Phoenix.  Definitely stop in and see Ann, Tracy or Victoria for your holiday nails.
2430	0	a	I'm sorry to be the 1st unhappy review, but darn, my toes, still hurt. my mom, daughter and I went 2 days ago for pedicures. Thankfully my mom and daughters experience was much better then mine they had nice ladies and a good job. The lady I had tore my toes up, it was the worst pedicure I've ever had, i get gel on my toes, because my nails are weak and split alot. The lady went to remove the gel used a new nail file on my little toes, that scrub thing, then picked it off with the clipper thing and almost rip my nail off thankfully she realized it was my nail and not polish, she keep looking at the clock like she had somewhere else to be. Sorry to say I won't be back and to bad because its so close to my house!
2431	1	a	My husband and tried out this new(small and quaint) restaurant for happy hour.  Prices are CRAZY good!(1/2 price apps and the drink prices were great too!)\nWe have tried the nachos(huge and delicious). My husband loved the meatballs(best he ever had) and the chili (somewhat spicy but he doesn't like a lot of spice)\n Also they had great entertainment on the weekend. We will love this place and can't wait to try things off the regular menu.
2432	0	a	"I am sorry, but this restaurant is not going to make it!  They have very inexpensive prices on the menu, but what you get is what you pay for! My husband was going to order the filet, wanted it rare. The owner said, the steak is very thin! (1/2\""). You cannot cook a steak that thin, rare! The owners are  trying to be waiters, servers, bartenders ! Music was nice, but the decore was not finished. Will not go back!"
2433	0	a	I'm with Cheryl.  I would be shocked if they make it.  Limited menu, there wasn't an entree salad option.  Ordered dinner salad and it tasted like ready made bag salad and bottled dressing.  My husband had Chicken Alfredo and sauce tasted like it was canned.  The bread was a warmed hoagie roll.\nI don't think they make anything from scratch.  \nI hate to be so negative but I don't think they are really trying!  No one greeted us when we walked in and they didn't greet anyone else who came in after us, it was awkward.
2434	1	a	Miga presents the most aesthetically pleasing modern restaurant space in Champaign County.\n\nI came here a week after it opened in September 2014. There were two or three customers inside and a dozen professionally dressed waitstaff standing by.\n\nThe service was competent and friendly.\n\nMiga offers several varieties of sake, but none are served warm. Our sake was served over ice and slices of cucumber in a clear glass pitcher after being poured from the bottle tableside.\n\nI spent only 30 minutes here having one drink and no food. I will definitely be back to eat sometime soon.\n\nMiga is justifiably pricey by the looks of the place. I hope the food sends the same message.\n\nOur waiter mentioned that Miga and the Campustown restaurant Sakanaya are owned by the same person.
2435	1	a	4 stars to the atmosphere and our cute waitress Rose. 3 star to the food. 2 to the cocktail Miga75.\n\nWe had the Golbi Rib-eye, nice flavor and texture and large portion. But no surprise there. The Buddism Bibimbap was just mediocre. The Miga75 was a plain mix of Gin, Soju and lemonade (with pulp). And one big plus is the serving team was really on it, nice, pleasant and helpful. Good place for a date night.
2436	1	a	4 stars for the atmosphere.
2437	0	a	We decided to try this place after watching a great film at the art theater.  We arrived around 9pm on a Saturday and there were plenty of diners and the atmosphere was nice. We decided to sit at the bar since we were only going to have some light food and a drink. We sat and sat and sat for about 15 minutes at the bar where staff was coming and going constantly before anyone said anything to us. \n\nAfter we were finally acknowledged the staff person was nice and gave us menus. Then our actual waitress came to take our orders and give recommendations.  I had a cocktail called It's Seoul Good. The cocktail was tasty similar to a cosmo with soju.  We decided to share the Migu noodles which was very pretty and flavorful but VERY spicy. Even my boyfriend who loves spicy food thought this was a bit over the top. Admittedly they mentioned it was spicy but this still seemed a bit on the extreme side and I'm no wimp.  \n\nWe finished our meal and as we finished our drinks I pulled out a credit card to pay and then the waiting began again. Another 15 minutes before anyone said anything or came to give us the check while the waitress stood less than 5 feet away chatting up someone the entire time. \n\nIt's one thing to be super busy and the service be slow but there was plenty of staff that just were totally ignoring us or so busy chatting up one customer they couldn't be bothered to check if we needed anything.  A quick bite that should have taken at most 45 minutes took closer to an hour and a half. \n\nThe food and drink were ok but still fairly pedestrian. I may give this place one more try but I'm not itching to get back for anything we experienced.
2438	1	a	"I first fell in love with homegoods when I moved into my first apartment some years ago, right after that \""holy shit I have no bed sheets/ towels/ front door mat/ non-plastic utensils\"" feeling sets in.  \nIf you've never been they have nearly every sort of home decor item (candles, paintings, picture frames), every thing to set up a kitchen (plates, silverware, pots and pans, and even \""gourmet\"" (I \""\"" because I don't really trust food stuffs from a discount home store) non refrigerated foods and seasonings, bed and bath linens, and a smaller selection of home organization and cleaning products.  \nAs far as brands go I would say I recognize about 40-50% of the brands they have like DNKY, Ralph Lauren, Le Cruset, Oneda, Yankee Candle co., Nicole Miller Etc. \nAbout 80% of things are good value (I recently got a set of 550 thread count king sheets for $40!), But some of the stuff (usually unknown brand decor items) are a bit more than I would pay in a regular store... But maybe I can chock it up to its not my style haha \n\nI really like this shop, when it was first opened I felt like it was really picked over, so i held off writing a review... and now 2 months later their stock has replenished and its great! \nGo in with an open mind... you might not find sea foam green bath towels with embroidered seahorses.... but you'll find something to fit the bill."
2439	0	a	Ordered delivery and after an hour wait the order was wrong. Called to report it and they argued that it wasn't wrong. They finally agreed to make the correct item and bring it to us. After 45 more minutes, still no replacement food. Called to cancel and they offered to make us a free roll next time. There will not be a next time. Way to many other Chinese delivery restaurants to ever try this place again.
2440	0	a	Food is too salty and lots of MSG. The service is not good at all. I was ordering and the waitress just left to attend to something in the middle. Will not go again.
2441	0	a	If I could give less than one star, I would.  This restaurant is the entire reason I finally got a Yelp account.  I should have run out of the restaurant when I saw the huge black curtain hiding whatever it is that goes on in that kitchen.  The food itself was oily.  Mediocre, at best.  I should have listened to my gut (no pun intended) when it told me to stop eating.  The morning after I ate here, I felt nauseous and light-headed.  Then a few hours later, I finally threw up.  An hour or two after THAT, I threw up again.  Turns out, my entire family got sick that day.  I reported the restaurant to the Southern Nevada Health District.  I'm so angry with this place that reporting them to the health department wasn't enough for me to feel avenged, so here I am, warning anyone who will listen to stay far, far away from here.  That is, unless you enjoy food poisoning-- I don't know your life.
2442	1	a	I checked out this place last night and fell in love! The decor was outstanding. I felt like I was in Louisiana! One part of the wall looked like the inside of an 1800's style plantation. Super cool! There were statues of the Virgin Mary, along with rosaries and voodoo beads. The bar's light was red which gave it a creepy yet cozy and intimate feel. Beer bottles hung as lights.\n\nThe service was great. Our waitress always came to our table with a nice smile on her face. She was attentive to us, asking us if we wanted another round of drinks or food. \n\nThe music was good too; a mix of punk rock music. \n\nThe prices are great too. Very affordable to eat and drink the night away, especially if you're sharing shots and pitchers. \n\nCan't wait to return, I think my friends and I will be regulars.
2443	1	a	So happy to see Thai Basil open at PV Mall. We had dinner there last night and it was awesome!!!  The red curry is my favorite but everything was great, as was the service. I will be going there often.
2444	1	a	Excellent food and service here. Get the red thai curry, it was perfectly flavored with mild heat. Also good was the thai basil which we ordered with chicken. Good service as well. Will come here again!
2445	0	a	From the previous reviews I was expecting alot from this restaurant. \n\nHonestly wanted to like this place but did not live up to expectations. \n\nOrdered the Coconut Shrimp,  Drunken Noodles,  Chicken Curry and Thai Basil Fried Rice.\n\nThe Coconut Shrimp was pretty good, the Drunken Noodles were good but did not leave an impression. The Chicken Curry was tasty. We ordered the yellow curry but the base was a little on the watery thin side. I prefer it to be a little bit more thick. The fried rice was just average. \n\nThe service was good and fast.\n\nAs we finished,  they brought take out containers and as I poured the curry base into the plastic container there was a hole in the bottom and began to leak out. Half of the liquid base poured down the table onto the floor.\n\nOne of the workers was real concerned and the other asked how was the food.\n\nWas not overall taken by this place and not to certain to return.
2446	0	a	"I have never written a review before but felt so strongly about our recent visit here that i found it necessary to download the app just for this review. \n\nThe service was awful. No one seated us. There was only one server for the restaurant and he wasn't able to handle it even though there were only 3 tables at any given time. He was unfocused and needed us to repeat ourselves several times. He never checked in on us or refilled our waters. They also neglected to clear any tables after people left, leaving loads of dirty plates and trash sitting there for the duration of our meal.\n\nWe loved the potstickers and dipping sauce but other food was awful. I ordered the grilled seafood (an $18 entree). The calamari was inedible, the fish, mussels, and shrimp were way overcooked. The \""salad\"" was large torn pieces of unwashed romaine without dressing. My husband ordered curry noodles that he described as \""disgusting\"". The curry was watery and the chicken seemed to be haphazardly cooked. This dish had the appropriate spice but was swimming in coconut milk and lacked the actual curry spice.\n\nNeedless to say, we won't be returning."
2447	0	a	"To say I had an incredibly\nFrustrating and drawn out ordeal with this location would be an understatement. \n\nLet me preface with the fact that I'm a huge fan of the other thai basil locations and will continue to frequent the other locations. I will never go back to this location despite how close it is to me and how excited I was that it opened.\n\nI ordered pick up to take to my girlfriend as a nice gesture to save her from cooking dinner. When I got to her house and opened our order (chicken pad Thai and beef green curry- our go to every time at every location) and there was one piece of meat in the curry. One whole piece. There were zero pieces of chicken in the pad Thai.\n\n I figured I must have picked up the wrong food so I called them back. The managerTo say I have had an incredibly\nFrustrating ordeal with this location would be a severe understatement. \n\nLet me preface with the fact that I'm huge fan of thai basil and will continue to frequent the other locations. I will never go back to this location. \n\nI order pick up everytime and the first two times everything was fine. The third time, I ordered pick to take to my girlfriend as a nice gesture to save her from cooking dinner. When I got to her house and opened our order (chicken pad Thai and beef green curry) and there was one piece of meat in the curry. One whole piece. There were zero pieces of chicken in the pad Thai. I figured I must have picked up the wrong food so I called them back. The manager apologized and said next meal would be comped since I didn't have time to go back and have them  apologized and said the next full order would be comped since I didn't have time to go back and have them remake it. Reasonable solution in my opinion and I was happy again.  I asked the manager to please make sure her team knew about our meal and she assured me I wouldn't have any issues redeeming my meals when I called back.\n\nTwo weeks later, I decided to take thai basil up on the standing offer. Except no one knew what I was talking about when I called in. The man I spoke with said he'd have to call the manager to check and would call me back. No call after an hour so I called again. He said she remembered only one of our entrees having a mistake. I was frustrated and gave him my contact info to have the manager call me directly.\n\nShe never called me back so I called again a few days later and I had got the same \""I have to check with the manager\"" from a girl this time, followed by no phone call, so I called back again 30 minutes later. Same story about one meal so again I gave this girl  my contact info and let her know I expected a call back this time. Again, no call.\n\nMy ask was very reasonable- a simple call back so we could have a conversation about this specific incidence and the manager either felt it was unnecessary or the staff did not inform her. Either way the service is inexcusable and for a new location that is constantly empty, this is not the way to win over repeat customers."
2448	0	a	"Terrible service. Dudes are distracted. Some hokey system about tracking repairs that they \""guarantee\"". (Keep your receipt on you forever) or it's not traceable. My screen was cracked.  Not a complicated issue. Never fit very well, then it started freezing all the time \nGuy basically told me to pay again.   Waste of time.  So much competition out there. Try harder."
2449	0	a	I took my son to his friend's birthday party here. It was like a very small version of Pump It Up. The first thing I noticed was floors were concrete with a thin foam like covering only around the bounce houses which I thought was dangerous for the kids. The owners (or at least who I believed to be the owners) were running around still setting up when the party began. So far the party was great. Then there was a lady (owner I think) who deflated the basketball hoop and was saying (rather loud) how disrespectful the people were and how this was her house and they will have to pay for this. My first thought is, I wonder what happen and why she would be saying this in front of her clients guests (and her potential future guests). My son came and told me that she was yelling at people for jumping on the inflatable basketball hoop, and that her mats were tore up...the cheap foam mats I can get for my son with the alphabet on them...I couldn't believe that she would for one say these things to kids, and two that she would bad mouth her client and/or her clients guests out in the middle of the party. With this being said and I was a potential customer I will not be back to this place. Even if something was broken it shouldn't not of been brought up in front of the guests and especially the kids. I was very disappointed in the customer service of this establishment and will not be back.
2450	1	a	Its times like this im glad im a yelper. One star for this establishment is far from fair. Im sure the person who wrote the other review had her reasons, but keep in mind its a brand new facility & theyre still working out bugs. \n\nI for one am very glad to have another indoor jump house place to add to my familys repetoir. \n\nWe came here for a party & were greeted by the owner, roger, who was polite & friendly. \n\nOverall it was a positive experience. My kids loved it, i found out their open bounce is ALL DAY and only $8 a kid (a buck cheaper than the place nearest me, so id spend a little extra gas to come here), and their parties are cheaper than bounce u. \n\nCompared to bounce u, this place is smaller but cleaner & safer BY FAR (see myreview on bounce u in henderson, my daughters foot got caught in a hanging rope that shouldnt have beenthere & she was suspended by her leg, and no one was even there to supervise. Havent been back since.)\n\nMy only comments to the owner are to help make a new place a bit better:\n\nThe matts WERE loose. I stepped on one & it came apart under my foot. May want to think about gluing them in place. If not to the floor, at least to each other. \n\nAlso if you pay for a party, you really shpuld have more than an hour and a half in the facility, and you probably shpuld have help to serve food, cake, etc. i didnt know my hostess very well but i wound up helping her serve cake because she didnt have help. If youre only going to have 1.5 hour parties, having a helper to serve will speed up the party process for sure. \n\nOne final thought. This place is difficult to find. A sign by the street would be helpful. \n\nAs i said, overall a positive experience. \n\n4 stars.
2451	1	a	Cute place. Owner is really nice. It is one of the cheaper indoor places in town. Good selection of snacks. Clean. My 2yr old son likes it here. I would say it would be for ages 8 and under. My older kids I think would get bored since they are use to the bigger places.
2452	0	a	Whats the point of being indoors if your A/C doesnt work! Was soooooo hot and humid after 15 min of play had to leave do to dehydrated sweat soaked kids.... I just sat and watched and would have preferred to be outside in the sun! other than that..... the facility was clean, management friendly... and had the a/c worked would have been 5 stars.
2453	0	a	Think twice before you plan a party here. The manager may sound like he is going to make your day with an extravagant party. But he is a total rip off. 1 never sent us an invoice or a reminder call of the details and what all was included. 2 didn't provide any food and didn't tell us until 45 minutes into the party. 3 owner is a total inconsiderate a**hole. When he was told of the situation simply told us tough luck and continued watching his football game. This place would be a lot better with the change of owners. The regular staff is great.
2454	0	a	I thought this might be a good place to have my daughter's 5th birthday. We invited her friends, family and entire class so I booked the VIP party which was supposed to be private. They called me the night before to say they had double booked. He said it had never happened before, but when I talked to some friends at my daughter's gymnastics class (after I booked) they told me that same thing had happened to them. I had young kids and my 2 year old who has a tendency to wander off so I wanted a controlled environment. This was very important to me. I also had a big group as did the other party so instead of 45 people, we we're expect ion 90 in the small space. The staff was unorganized and when leaving, the lobby was so packed because there was no time in between parties. The people who came in to set up had to wait for the previous party to clear out and it cut into their party time. No one looked very happy that day. They were too expensive as well. Last year we did Child's Play and it went flawlessly. We did very little work...the party helpers did so much right down to handing out the favors. It only cost $300 where Jump n jungle wanted $375. We tipped the party planners nicely at CP but did not at Jump n jungle. They tried to make up for their mistake by not having us pay for the party but money was not the problem. We will not book there again, especially when new child-friendly companies are popping up all over the place. They seriously need to reevaluate their system.
2455	1	a	Totally worth the price. Clean, air conditioned & bouncy. Lots of bounce houses to choose from and a toddler room for toddlers. Clean bathrooms too.\nI wish they had healthier choices for the kids, apples and bananas and oranges would be great to offer along with the sugar filled candy.
2456	1	a	We had my daughters 2nd birthday party there, it was awesome. $150 for up to 15 kids not bad price. They were so helpful with helping us loading n loading all the food/drinks. The owner helped with cutting the cake. I brought an ice cream cake so they had a freezer to put it in. Kids had fun! Only bad thing is that they only wanted us to bring food from a restraunt, no homecooked food. It would helped if we could make our own food n save some $$$ that way.
2457	1	a	Went for the first time today! Kids had a ton of fun and the owner was extremely nice. There is a separate toddler room, which is great! Only downside was the temperature, but its understandable because of the many bounce houses and being in a warehouse.
2458	1	a	Had my daughters birthday here august 17th, had so much fun!! \nAdults and kids got to jump and play around, however I was under the impression others were not going to be able to have open play but 2 others were in there. Not that it was a big deal but I have a lot of roudy people in my family so we all had to take it down a few notches. Other then tagt we love coming here for play time my daughter had so much fun!!! Plus if you follow them on Facebook they always have really good deals
2459	0	a	I decided to have my son's birthday party here because it was a change of pace from the other jump house facilities that we usually go to for parties.  When we arrived for his party we were told that we didn't purchase a PRIVATE PARTY and that it was OPEN TO THE PUBLIC.  I spent $200 on what I believed to be a private party for my son, it was never explained to me on the phone and my invoice does not list it as an open to the public style party, I absolutely never would have agreed to that.  Instantly upset I tried to pay the extra money to have it be a private party right then and there, I didn't want the extended time, I just wanted to enjoy my son's birthday without other people around like I originally thought, the woman upfront refused to allow me to do that because it was listed on their website as open jump, she told me she would be losing money by not allowing it to be public jump, even though with the extra $100 I would have paid to make it private she would have needed 21 open jump kids to show up in that 90min party to make it a loss of money.\n\nBut she's right, she will lose money because we will never be supporting this business again, and neither will the 10 other families who attended the party and know the situation.  Trying to charge $200 for a public party is outrageous, they charge $5 per child for open jump, I had 10 kids at the party, which meant that I had the pleasure of spending $150 on a room with tables in it...gee thanks guys.\n\nJust the shear fact that theirs an option for a public party to me is ridiculous, I don't know of any other indoor playground that uses a similar business practice.\n\nIn addition to this whole situation the facility was filthy, the floor was black, I don't even know how a place with a no shoe policy even has floors that dirty. The jump houses were falling apart, you could barely get up the rungs on the obstacle course because it was so worn down, there's no air conditioning in the party room so all the children who were already running around never got a chance to cool off while they ate.\n\nI'm 100% disappointed in this facility, their cleanliness, and business practice.
2460	0	a	It would be interesting to see what the sales receipts reveal about how many people eat at Gus's before 10pm versus how many get delivery (for a $5 fee) between midnight and 4am.  I don't think the pizza is very good at Gus's, so if you need middle-of-the-night chow, Geno's Cheesesteaks will deliver a freshly-made burger, chili fries, or a satisfactory pizza until 4am (Silver Mine Subs is cheaper and have a few decent sandwiches and deliver late too, but their cheesesteak is nowhere near as good as Geno's).  I see I've turned my review into the late night delivery wars-----it was inevitable, I guess.  Gus's will deliver beer to your door:  a 6-pack of PBR for $6.99 or Sierra Nevada for $9.99....
2461	0	a	The first couple of times we ordered from Gus's the food was pretty good but the last two times it wasn't. Last time it was burnt and was barely edible and this time they got our toppings wrong and said I didn't tell them right, we didn't get a receipt on delivery to see what I told them..needless to say we probably won't be ordering from here again..
2462	0	a	Not good at all. I heard from a co worker that they had good pizza and as a nyc boy I had to try it. The only the thing they got right was the size of the slice but that's it.\nWe tried to order the Greek fries and the lady said they didn't have lemon juice and couldn't make them and before I could ask for them without it she snapped just fries. A little rude but it's all good. I just wanted food. So I ordered two cheese slices and my friend got pepperoni and sausage.\n\n \nIt came out hot and fresh but also the crust was a little dark. \nI folded my slice and prepared to consume some great pizza. But as I took a bite from that slice it literally broke on half and the cheese slid off. Not very good. Me and my friend both agreed we could barely taste the sauce cause it was very bland. The pizza had no taste and was too greasy. I love a little grease like the next guy but this was dripping down my hand into the plate when i was eating it. I ordered two slices but only ate them because I didn't eat dinner. \nMy friend didn't even finish his slices.\n\nSkip this place. While the place looked nice and was cool the food was not. Try Venezia's instead on mill. Such better pizza and service. They should lose the NY in there name cause that was not NY pizza.
2463	0	a	Quite honestly the worst customer service experience I have ever had.  Not only did the manager stand within five feet of me as I leaned on the counter waiting for someone to acknowledge me, but when I finally did clear my throat and ask for help ( after four minutes, which I actually counted because three employees made eye contact with me and made a point of ignoring me so I started a timer on my phone)but when I told her I really would like to know how long until my food was ready so that I could plan on calling an uber.  I explained to her that the reason for this was that one of the members of our group had a few too many and wasn't feeling well so I needed to know if I should call a separate uber to take them home first or if our food would be ready soon since we had already waited twenty minutes.  Instead of answering our question she told me that since they weren't feeling well if they made a mess she would call the cops and we would all be arrested for graffiti.  I told her that was probably one of the dumbest things I had ever heard and I really was just trying to make sure that we would be able to get our food and still be able to get our friend home.  At this point she threatened to call the cops because she felt unsafe so I asked for a manager.  She told me that she was the supervisor so she was the closest thing they had to a manager at that time of night so any complaints I had could go directly to her and they weren't going anywhere beyond that. I told her I would be out of there as soon as my food was ready and I would like to know how long that would take.  Instead of answering me she stared at me while she called 911 and told them I had threatened to assault her.  The fact that I'm writing this review just an hour after this incident should tell you that this was completely false.  I will no longer be coming here and I sincerely hope that you don't either.  There are plenty of other places open this late that won't try to have you arrested for checking on your food that it simply isn't worth the attitude you get from the staff.

If the story above is to long to read let me sum it up for you.  The customer service here is the worst I've ever seen and management doesn't care in the slightest.
2465	0	a	"Literally the worst fucking service of my life. Waited 2 hours for our pizza and when the guy came and delivered our WRONG order and we told him about it, he said, and I quote, \""do you wanna wait another 2 hours?'\n\nWhat the literal fuck. \n\nAnd to top it all off, our pizza was cold AF."
2466	0	a	As a 20 year local of Las Vegas this bar is just another example of the Wall Street controlled Las Vegas strip ripping off customers.  We decided to come here after a concert and after ordering a round of drinks discovered that a glass of champagne cost $29.  This bar has a nice atmosphere but unfortunately not nice enough to charge $29 for a drink. It will be my last trip to the Delano.  The mob figures who ran Las Vegas in the 1960s and 70s would be disgusted with the way the Las Vegas strip now treats customers by gouging them at every opportunity in its restaurants and bars.
2467	1	a	I have been to Janine for 4 or 5 massages and I cannot go any longer without singing her praises.  \n\nCompared to other masseuse's Janine uses a deep technique that is neither too hard or too light.  She does not treat me like a normal customer, but as her only customer, and that is what makes her special.  \n\nShe focuses on what I need on the day that I am in, and she remembers when I return, even if it is 6 weeks later.\n\nI can't wait to go back as my latest weekend of biking and gym workouts are calling for some of those true blue healing arts!
2468	1	a	Easy thing to say that this building (Old Spaghetti Factory) has had a long history of being cursed... I think Sauce is here to break that curse!\n\nWe walked in on a late Friday afternoon, this place is HUGE. Tons of restaurant seating available, large bar, lounge type seating near the pool tables, and a back room for live music and karaoke. We were greeted promptly by the bartender, and were given happy hour pricing even though we were a tad early (not quite 4pm yet). She was easy to talk to and let us know about all their events going on and coming up. Fridays are Karaoke night and Saturdays are live music nights! Some themed nights are on the calendar as well!\n\nRich, the owner, was quick to come see our large group. He is an awesome individual.. not the kind of owner you meet who's gonna brown nose his customers and be fake and smiley. Rich was true and authentic, not shy of who he is. One can say that an owner should be sucking up to clientele, but I think authenticity will bring people back!\n\nWe spent most our time watching the ball games on for the day, plenty of TVs surrounding the bar, a perfect place to go for the games and no hesitation from staff when we asked for a different game on the TV we were watching.  \n\nFor food, we only ordered appetizers from the HH menu since we had already eaten: spinach-artichoke dip, fried cheese, and a personal pizza. I loved the spinach dip, hot and gooey with visible spinach & artichoke hearts with cooked pizza dough (i think) for dipping. Fried cheese isn't plain ol' mozz sticks, its provolone wrapped pepperoni and then fried and then placed on a plate with marinara (I believe?) and pesto cream sauce. The pizza was inhaled down the bar, so I didn't get to partake. \n\nI can't give a 5 star yet because our visit was centralized around the bar. I look forward to trying their entrees on the menu and for some of their live music nights. I have a good feeling about Sauce. Just what the neighborhood needs: genuine people, yummy food, full beers, and a little bit of nightlife fun.
2469	0	a	Came in the second time for Happy Hour.  Spent $10 on a $25 certificate on restaurant.com\n\nTold Bartender/waiter 3 times I had the certificate.  He said we will apply at the end.\nYou have to order $50 to use the certificate.  Ordered a couple things more than I would have to comply.\n\nGo to check out manager says can't use it for Happy Hour.  We will see which is less regular price less certificate or happy hour.  It was $11 less regular price less certificate.  Since I spent $10 I save a whole $1 and got things I would not have.\n\nI was clear from beginning I had coupon and I was a prior customer.\n\n$11 for 2 small crab cakes that were very fishy.  Pepperoni cheese bites overdone.  Just not that great and pretty expensive.  Pizza was okay (would not have ordered one to go to get to $50) $7.50 for a beer.\n\nGuess what.  I won't be back. There are some great happy hour deals out there, this just isn't it.
2470	0	a	Sauce, I wanted to like you. You never gave me a chance. \n\n  I had heard of your happy hour specials. After work, my energy had been too drained to make the trip to the north parking lot of the Galleria Mall. Yesterday I had the chance to give you a try. I had just voted in the Galleria Mall and when I was in the bottom level of Kohl's sneaker hunting, I looked out the door to lay eyes on you a few hundred feet away. It was time to take a hiatus from shopping to give you a try. The walk from Kohl's is a beeline to your door. Some malls like the one in St. George, Utah would consider you a mall tenant. As I neared closer to the door that faces the mall (not Galleria Drive), I saw the Happy Hour specials. That could be for another time. It was 2 pm on a Friday afternoon. As I made it nearer to the door, I noticed that the parking lot was barron. This was an oman to the infinitesimal amount of customers inside. \n\n  Now inside, I am standing inside a colossal lifeless building that reminded me of a monastery. I'd gaze at an unoccupied host station to my right, empty bar in the middle, and monastery spaces to my left and right. I'd gaze and gaze and gaze for ten minutes. I was feeling like an unwanted bull. My left foot was bothering me and I did not want to resume sneaker shopping just yet. There seemed to be a want of a seating policy. To me, your policy is sauce. Was I supposed to walk deeper into the monastery rooms? Was an employee (there are employees here?) going to venture toward the entrance where there might just be a slight possibility that an individual could of walked inside with an intention of like eating here? Why wasn't there a buzzer that informs an employee that somebody is here? Finally, a waitress acknowledged me. She apologized for the long delay on account of a blind spot where she did not see me. That is a bunch of sauce because she should of occasionally walked past this blind spot to the waiting area where customers are waiting to be seated. \n\n  I followed the waitress (no hostess here at 2 pm on this Friday). we walked deep into the recesses of the monastery to the left. For whatever reason I am one of the couple of people in this restaurant, and she seats me out of the way. Why not nearer the kitchen where I would be nearby instead of some Bull seated way out in the boondocks of the monastery. The waitress gave me the menu. This is the last I'd see of her. \n\n Spending some time in your lifeless place, I had trouble believing that you are this energetic bar slash Italian restaurant in the later hours of the day. I just couldn't fathom it. As I looked at the menu, it was dawning on me that I was better off transforming from an unwanted Bull to royalty at a different place. This is Las Vegas after all and not Siberia. The menu just wasn't the kind of sauce that is my flavor. I saw relatively few lunch specials. But my love for eggplant parmesan with provolone cheese topped with pasta and a glass of Coke turned a blind eye to the fact that there was zero mention of coming with a soup or salad. If only you gave me a chance I would of exchanged $20 of my hard earned money for it. I remained an ignored bull. I had had enough. I was now in the mood to be appreciated in either Miller's Ale House or Cafe Zupas. It was time to leave the lifeless spaces of the monastery. \n\n  Sauce, I wanted to like you. But you barely acknowledged me and in reality should open at 4 pm,  if you treat customers like this as 2 pm. I don't like going to a restaurant to feel like an unwanted bull. To me that is just bull sauce.
2471	0	a	Super average. Nice decor inside but the food is very, very average. I think when you go to a restaurant it should be food that's more elevated than what you could make at home. And it wasn't. The spaghetti sauce on my sons dinner tasted like it was out of a can. My husbands sandwich was so bland that panera would have been a better choice. I hope the owners look at the menu and try to make their dishes more interesting bc if not I don't see them being in business for very long.
2472	1	a	"Cool new place on the outside of galleria mall\n\nPros: \nPesto crab cakes were outstanding\n\nPasta: cool concept where you can make your own concoction. I love cream and I love pesto so that was a winner.\n\nService was friendly and attentive \n\nGrab that groupon!\n\nCons:\n\nI got the Quattro formagi pizza and I like Gorgonzola but it seemed to be a bit over powering compared to the other cheese trio on a Quattro. I would stick to the appetizers and pasta since everything else we tried was pretty good. Dough was \""ok\"".\n\nWanted to try the tiramasu based on yelp pics. Maybe next time. Will be back."
2473	0	a	NFL football on and I'm listening to Casey Kasum tip hits from 1978. What is the target demographic? This isn't the only time I left due to terrible ambiance. I'll keep  giving this place a chance because of the happy hour pizza and wings. I hope they will find an identity.
2474	0	a	"Definitely won't be coming back. We came in to celebrate a friends birthday. We ordered the Caesar salad- dressing tasted like mayo :/,  fried calamari appetizer- over cooked, the garlic knots- tasted decent, but we waited 30 minutes for the \""dough to rise\""(?), pineapple and prosciutto pizza- gross, cardboard tasting crust, and the meat lovers pizza- gross, but not as bad as the other pizza. \nThe service was awful, and our waitress had ZERO customer service skills."
2475	1	a	So good!! Best Indian food I've had in a long time.! Great service too! I will definitely be back!
2476	1	a	Great compliments to the chef!! Not only was Marigold Maison's food spectacular, so was the service. Very professional service and knowledgable of the menu. There was a variety in choices of dishes and also in how spicy you can get it. My friends and I enjoyed our evening there. Will be visiting soon!!
2477	1	a	After a day of shopping, my sister and I stopped at Marigold Maison for dinner. We were starving and excited to see all the options available.\n\nStarting off with wine, we sat down and tried not order the whole menu. Our waiter, Nick, suggested the Gol Guppa so we ordered that along with some Samosa Chaat, Bhel Puri, and Eggplant. Eggplant and Bhel Puri were great and the Samosa Chaat had a blast of flavors--- we LOVED the Gol Guppa. \n\nFor our entrees we got the Onion Naan Chicken Tikka and the Tandori Shrimp. Again, oh so yummy!!! I have never had Naan with onion before and after having this, I am not sure I ever will eat it any other way!! We ended up boxing up at least half of each dinner to take home. Guess we over did it little on the apps!\n\nSo even though we were pretty full, I really had to try the rice pudding. A friend of mine was there a week earlier and she could not stop talking about how amazing it was. My sister was a little apprehensive as she is not really a rice pudding kind of girl. However, it was a hit! I think she even ate more of it than I did.\n\nSo glad we stopped in! Can't wait to go again.
2478	1	a	The chickpea ceviche was fantastic. The Vindaloo chicken - spicy, just the way I like it. Rohit provided great recommendations. We'll be back.
2479	1	a	If you want great Indian food then this is the place for you!  This is by far the BEST Indian food in Scottsdale/Phoenix.\n It was so much fun to try different dishes and have everyone taste GREAT.  Yes, everyone was delicious.\n I couldn't pick a favorite because they were are ALL fantastic.   When we left the restaurant we were already planning our next trip back.
2480	1	a	Great food, and service. Atmosphere is fun, though small. It has some outdoor seating that will be great in the winter.
2481	0	a	"It isn't real Indian food.  I thought the food was unusually sweet, like they were putting too much sugar in it, which is a trick restaurants use to get you to like otherwise average food.  Nice atmosphere.  Iced tea was really good.  Salad greens were not super fresh.  Chicken was sparse in Tikka Masala.  Cooked vegetables were overcooked. Raita was soooo sweet I couldn't eat it.  There are a bunch of 5 star reviews, but be careful, because they are offering gift certificates for Yelp reviews. They had a \""restaurant consultant\"" there who was driving the turnaround of this place, which is by the same people who did the failed Bombay Spice.  They are definitely playing the Yelp game.  I am not saying this place was terrible or anything... just not remotely authentic and pretty average despite all the pumped up Yelp reviews.  I would give it 3 stars were it not for all the Yelp gaming they are doing, which for me knocks it down another star."
2482	1	a	Great experience and wonderful food. The management was welcoming and the service was exceptional. Great to have a place with a tandoor oven and the chicken tikka was very tasteful. Friend found out why the pork chops come highly recommended.
2483	1	a	My wife sells seafood for a living and visit a lot of different fine restaurants, this one by far is my favorite in the valley. You must try the eggplant I have not liked eggplant all my life but what this gifted chef does with it is amazing!
2484	1	a	Just took some take-out lunch from here and can say with sincerity that I am now a fan of Marigold Maison.  I was the only person there which I hope is due to the fact that I came unknowingly just as they opened, because I really want this place to succeed.  \n\nOrdered Chicken Tikka Masala and Garlic Naan (my go-to at all Indian restaurants because I love it ok?) and while I didn't find them the best I've ever had I can say they were really good.  My one nit picky pseudo complaint is that the masala sauce was a little more liquidy than I'm used too, but that was a minor issue considering that the flavor was there.   It is a bit pricey but I knew that ahead of time and dont really blame the place because the portions are quite large (please dont change that!).  This is without question the best Indian food in this area.  I repeat in this area because there is of course better in the city, but I mean within a 5 mile radius.  \n\nI will return for my garlic naan and tikka cravings.
2485	1	a	It was pretty busy for a late lunch on a Monday. I absolutely loved the food - when I heard same ownership as Roka, I knew we had to check it out, as Roka was always a favorite of mine when I lived I'm AZ. Don't expect anything like Roka though! This is a totally different concept, in the side of a strip mall, and much more casual.\n\nI went with my bf and his family, we tried just about everything we could from a couple of the street food options to the lunch platter with chicken tikka and another chicken with a spinach curry (thali's?).  The chickpea dip with potatoes was super good and unique, the sauteed rice with vegetables and curry was fantastic as was the garlic naan.  I loved the quinoa salad on the lunch platter, it was a lot of food and fun to share between four of us. The chickpea flour battered chicken was a good option for very picky kids - although we loved the spicier options! \n\nOur server was good about describing the preparations and we asked him to ask the chef to order for us (a good way to get to try the best items I think). We ended up with four dishes that I had never had before and I loved them all!  If I were local, I would def make it a fun lunch or date night spot.
2486	1	a	Came across Master Lock & Security on Yelp today when my front door lock broke when I tried to unlock it. I called to get help and Carmon the owner answered. I told him what happened and he said that he would be at my condo in 25 minutes.  Low and behold he got here in 25 minutes... I was impressed! I was so relieved when he fixed my front door locks... He did an amazing job, fast and efficient! He also gave me a great deal! I am so happy I called him!!! Thank you Carmon!!! I highly recommend him!!! 5 stars all the way!!!!
2487	1	a	Excellent service.  One of my trucks had the key break off in the gas cap.  Carmon came out quickly and was able to extract Need someone at Southern hills around 2.30pm.\nWill do cvn in someone with pacer .\nSo need 5th check setting before n after cvn.\nRoom icu20the key and fix the issue.  Highly recommend.  Fast and good service.  Will definitely use again.
2488	1	a	Master Lock & Security truly knows what fast service is all about! I was stuck locked out of my car at 2 a.m. after work on the strip, and the picked up the phone right away! The guy told be it was going to take about 20 minutes before he got there... HE WAS THERE IN LESS THAN 10 minutes! Master Lock & Security got me out of that parking within less than 20 minutes after making a phone! Fast Service and Cheap Prices! #1 Locksmith in Vegas by far!
2489	1	a	Master Lock and Security... EPIC! \n\nSomehow I just was so damn clumsy with my keys. Tried to pack everything in my trunk and forgot my keys were also in my hand. Threw the keys in the trunk and shut the door. \n\n\nBlah this is like the 3rd time I have ever done this. Always a pain in the ass. \n\n\nAll in all... Very fast service ... Got everything done in about 2 minutes. Great stuff and if you have a similar issue like I did.. Don't hesitate to give them a call!
2490	1	a	I just used Master Lock & Security recently and they  rekeyed all the doors in the home I just purchased.  They did a fantastic job and all for a price that was lower than everywhere else I called. The tech was very friendly, knowledgeable and punctual. I highly recommend them and their services:)
2491	1	a	We locked ourselves out of the house , it's cold and windy and dark and called them to unlock our security screen door in Henderson anthem did it in a few minutes , nice guy went as described
2492	1	a	Carmon was very pleasant to work with, very knowledgeable, very quick and very reasonably priced vs. his competitors.  He explained what type of lock we had (high security) and presented us with all our cost options and didn't push the most expensive product on us, which we appreciate.\n\n-Satisfied customer
2493	1	a	Carmen was great!!! The deadbolt on my security door just wasn't turning anymore. So I gave him a call and he came out that day. He wanted to try to fix it first to save me money so I wouldn't have to buy a new lock. I already had a feeling that the lock wasn't going to work and my husband and I were already considering changing that lock to the high security key lock. What was great is that he was willing to try to fix the door first without any sales pitch for a new lock. He was awesome answered my questions that I had about the lock. I'm so glad that my deadbolt stopped working because I love this new security lock key!!! Thanks Carmen
2494	1	a	Master Lock and Security is absolutely amazing! Carmon came looked at my doors that needed to be fixed. It ended up being a custom job. So he took the time to think of a custom and efficient way that still was aestheticallypleasing, called back in a day as promised and came when agreed, on time. The work was better than imagined and problem fixed! He even wanted to vacuum the shavings!! Definitely will be my go to guys for any locksmith needs and highly recommended to friends and family! \nOverall great experience !
2495	1	a	I just had my house rekeyed by Carmon at Master Lock and Security.  I'm really happy with the work he did.  He responded quickly to the request and accommodated my schedule.  He got here when he said he would and called before arriving.  He did the work quickly and was very professional.  He was also very pleasant and nice to work with.  His prices were reasonable, and I'm really glad I called him.  I would not hesitate to recommend him to anyone.
2496	1	a	I would definitely recommend. Came very quickly and was fair with pricing. Also accommodated to our house rules ie no shoes.
2497	1	a	Master Lock & Security did a good job changing the front door locks. I wanted to change the lock to a double cylinder and he suggested just adding an additional lock on the back and not change the front thus preserving the finish. He came around and finished the work quickly and efficiently. Gave some helpful tips as well. I'll recommend to a friend.
2498	1	a	Lost my car key and called this company. Very courteous and great customer service also very reasonable price. I am very satisfied with the service they provided. Highly recommended.
2499	1	a	Today, Christmas eve of all days, I lost the key to my Ford pickup while shopping in a Walmart and in a panic needed to find someone to make me a new key. I'm so grateful I chose the people at Master lock and security to take care of me. They quoted me a fair price over the telephone, showed up quickly and on time, and not only professionally cut my new key, they even gave me a spare! They're mobile locksmithng setup is super hi tech and you know right away they mean business. On top of everything else, they're just nice people...and the world nerds more of that.
2500	0	a	You should read my entire review to know why I gave them 1 star and consider it before giving them a call.\n\nKey broke off in the front door and got locked out of the apartment. Found this highly rated locksmith online. Nathan came out, drilled the lock, replaced it, and made sure that it was keyed the same. Cost $266 for all of that and everything was awesome!\n\nThe lock never quite worked right in the door, but the door was damaged and we just chalked it up to that. Then 7 days after the first key broke in the lock, I come home from work and when I tried to open the door, the lock refused to move. I tried jiggling and shuffling the door and lock every way I could think of. Too much finagling and the key broke once again! I called them and explained they had just been there a week ago and that the same problem happened with the new lock. I was simply calling to see if they would honor their work or if I needed to seek other means to get into my apartment. He quickly took down my name and address and said they would be out in 20-30 minutes to take care of it. Awesome!\n\nAbout an hour and a half later, Nathan shows up and immediately recognizes the lock and problem. Although I had to wait, I wasn't that upset about it. Las Vegas is known for having to wait around for service calls. So I didn't think much of it. Especially since he had called and said he got stuck in traffic. It happens.\n\nHe has the door open in less than a minute, doesn't even have to use any tools, and the lock is still intact! Sweet! \n\nThen he asks for my ID and I realize he is counting up how much it's going to be. Wait, what? I had only called to ask if they would honor it in the first place. I would not have let them come out or waited outside for an hour and a half if I had known he was going to charge me. Ok, if it's only $20-30 I'll just figure it out and pay it. A bit ridiculous, but I'll figure it out.\n\nHe tries to charge me $88! For using a pair of pliers to finish turning the broken off part of the key! I could have easily done that myself and was planning on it if they wouldn't come out to fix the issue with the lock they put on. \n\nAfter some time, I got them to agree to $40 and have since worked on the lock. It opens so smoothly now that we have fixed the issue ourselves. It simply was an issue of the lock being too high for the door frame. A quick fix to a problem they caused and I bet he would have tried to charge me for that too!\n\nNever again will I use this locksmith.
2501	1	a	So glad BlowfishBBQ was at the Burgh Bash last week, so I was able to try the bbq chicken and the mac and cheese.  They were both on point!  The chicken was juicy and tasty!  I would love to try other things on the menu but so far with the chicken and mac, it's a 5 stars. Plus the guy who served us (not sure if it is hootie the pitmaster) at burgh bash was very nice and entertaining.
2502	1	a	I've been there so many times because their bakery offerings can vary each day- get the cheese twists while they are warm- two different types of small custard pie- one traditionally flan like and the other more of like a quiche (Macao style)- both are great. The BBQ pork buns are great- the dough is flaky and soft. Things are still served on paper plates but its worth it. They can make things without MSG on request if you are allergic (like me).
2503	1	a	This place is delicious and very good prices. Their coconut rolls are superb. They don't have a menu online or paper menu, I'm assuming they're working on that. So other than that, they're great!
2504	1	a	I'm a fan of the Living Room in Chandler and this new location did not disappoint! \n\nThe menu is the same as far as I can tell, and the interior is similarly inviting.  There is a HUGE patio, however I chose to eat inside since it was pretty chilly outside. Unfortunately it was just as cold inside...\n\nConsidering I was the only person in there on a Saturday at lunch time, perhaps it would bode well for them to offer an early happy hour or lunch specials...or perhaps the word just hasn't gotten out yet.  I didn't love Armitage, but hopefully the Living Room will succeed here.
2505	1	a	This place has become my ultimate favorite place to go out on the weekends! I love the set up! So chill yet full of energy! The service was amazing! The food..omg! Best place for your once a week cheat meall! Its kind of the new cool lounge to be at in North Scottsdale.
2506	0	a	I hadn't been here since the other wine bar closed down.  The Living Room did a great remodel and the place is very stylish and energetic with an upscale feel.\n\nThe spinach-artichoke dip and the cheeseburger sliders made for some tasty share-able appetizers.\n\nWhere things went south was at the bar.  I ordered a Union Jack IPA and the female bartender charged me $7 instead of the $6 that was listed on the menu.  She said they round up after tax.  Well tax in Scottsdale is 7.95% so my drink should have been $6.48 and rounding up to $7 is a blatant ripoff.  I'm not sure if she is just a rogue bartender or there is a problem here with management.\n\nThere's a lot to like about this place but keep a close eye out for bartenders lining their pockets at your expense.
2507	0	a	What a disappointment!  We went to check it out, we sat at one end of the bar where it looks like a large common table.  We had a margarita and a blueberry lemon drop.  Yuck, their well liquor must be the worst I have ever had. I imagine that is what gasoline would taste like.  We could not finish those drinks.  We decided to cut our loses and leave.
2508	1	a	I came across this place recently and it's now my primary local bar. The atmosphere and ambience of this place really sucked me in.  I'm not a fan of big crowds or loud bars, and while this place gets crowded at night you can generally enjoy a nice glass of wine before the rush at happy hour. \n\nDefinitely a more sophisticated and professional clientele.  See Major League Baseball and PGA tour players here a lot.  Can't go wrong pairing the Liberty School Cabernet with The Mediterranean Board appetizer. Cheers!
2509	1	a	I am from out of town, and was getting my tires changed across the street at Firestone. They recommended this place, and I'm glad they did! Both the food and service is outstanding! I came in with my 2 year old, and 5 month old and instead of the usual sigh and eye roll I get from servers, we all were treated with the utmost respect and kindness. This is a family run establishment who takes pride in both their service and food. Not to mention the cleanliness which is always a factor for me.
2510	1	a	Absolutely delicious!! Fast, friendly service. I had the vegetable spring rolls to start (they were crunchy and amazing) and the orange chicken lunch with wonton soup and would get it again but can't wait to try something different. Will go back again soon because I can't help it! The decor was perfectly fine (it's a Chinese restaurant in a strip mall for goodness sakes) clean, bright, and inviting. Fair prices too.
2511	1	a	Small unassuming sparsely decorated little place in a Safeway strip mall.  What it lacks in curb appeal it fully makes up for in price flavor and quantity.  I had the tofu chow fun, vegetable spring roll and my daughter had orange tofu.  All of the food was extremely fresh and beautifully prepared.  As someone who eats a lot of tofu this was very satisfying. The staff was very pleasant and service for takeout was fast without cutting corners.  So glad to find this local gem.
2512	1	a	If you are looking for healthy delicious Chinese food .. This is The Place!! YUM\nGive it try, you won't regret it.
2513	1	a	Best I have had in a long while. Service was great. Sad that tea is not loose leaf but Mongolian beef was yummy!
2514	1	a	Dr Teddy Sim is amazing! Knowledgable, professional, and friendly! He takes the time to truly understand your reasons for coming in and also explains the process and the health benefits of chiropractic care. Affordable rates and quality care... You know you're in good hands with Dr Ted!
2515	1	a	Once you visit this Chiropractor you will realize that there  is an obvious reason why he was rated one of the  TOP 10 doctors of las Vegas and Henderson area. \n\nTo me going to see Dr. Ted is a whole experience, from the way he friendly schedule you to the way he walk you through and follow up on your treatment.   He knows what he is doing and help you out with your health needs.    I know from my personal experience that he is VERY passionate about his career.  He is all about helping and educating his patients.
2516	1	a	I drive all the way from Summerlin to see Dr. Ted. Caring, careful and skilled, and I am a big baby!
2517	1	a	Very pleased with the care I been receiving the past three weeks at ChiropracTED.  I was skeptical about seeing a chiropractor - now I'm a believer.   My headaches diminished and the rates a very reasonable, much cheaper than the massage therapy and accupuncture.   Thanks Teddy Sim, DC
2518	1	a	Such an amazing doctor, extremely professional and well put together , he is a 'must see' doctor , he takes care of my daughter extremely well. Thanks Doc
2519	1	a	Dr Ted is an amazing doctor! I've been a patient of his for years & have followed him to the different practices. So glad he has his very own now! He's helped my neck & spine greatly. Would def recommend him to everyone
2520	1	a	Love Dr. Ted. I started seeing him after being rear ended in May. I had never been to a chiropractor before and was honestly very scared of the idea of an ajustment. Dr. Ted was so patient and gentle with me. I trust him with my spine and day!
2521	1	a	I've felt carpal tunnel coming on for some time now and my back has always been hunched since I was young. After going to Dr. Teddy my back is seriously looking and FEELING straight! My carpal tunnel decreased within the first day of going! I went home and got on the computer and payed attention to my arm to see if it would start getting numb again and it didn't. Within 1 treatment my carpal tunnel feeling had decreased and I noticed! I've been going for a month now and friends can definitely tell my back is looking much better. I DEFINITELY RECCOMEND DR.TEDDY!!!!\n\nPS: He's a fun one so bring your sense of humor!! xD
2522	0	a	"I walked into this place this morning to try it out. I live directly on the other side of the street from it, so I thought that if it's good, it would be extremely convenient to get coffee here. They have a drive-through window and there was one car at the window when I walked in. The sole employee working didn't see me at first, which wasn't his fault, but he was talking to the drive-through customer for quite awhile before he bothered to check if anyone was at the counter. Once he saw me, he said, \""Good morning. I'll be with you in just a minute.\"" He then proceeded to take about five more minutes bringing the other customer samples of what seemed like every drink on the menu and discussing the merits of each one. Given that they expect $3.25 for a small, plain cup of coffee, they should at least try to get you some in a reasonable amount of time. I simply walked out. As it is, I would - literally - not cross the street to go here."
2523	1	a	Great place! Convenient location. Friendly and knowledgable staff. And fantastic coffee!
2524	1	a	This is a bit pricy for a dinner, but worth it.  Service was wonderful.  Everyone very attentive.   My friend ordered a pork chop that is as close as my mom's (which is delicious in case you are wondering).  I could not take a picture fast enough.  The huevos rancheros were delicious too.  A bit cilantro intense but very tasty.  The handcrafted donuts were great.   However, they are covered in sugar so avoid if diabetic or do not like extra sugar coded deserts.  I saw others order the mason jars and rave about those.  It's a chocolate ganache, a strawberry short cake, and a banana cream in jars.  The Sunday looked good too.
2525	0	a	Sooooooooo slow. Open tables all over the place but still waited 35 minutes to be seated. Once seated waited a long time for waiter to even check if we wanted water.  Food was good but not worth the wait. Hate to see how this place runs when all the tables are taken
2526	0	a	I was excited to dine at the newest addition to the Mirage hotel. At  this 24hr eatery, food looks better than it tastes and waaay over priced. $14 waffle that can be eaten in 4 bites! Come on! The Huevos Rancheros are a joke. Tortilla is not fried like it should be but soggy. Salsas don't taste homemade and beans I'm sure are from a can. Maybe I'm spoiled on Mexican coming from LA but it doesn't even feel like they're trying. Decor is very cute which makes it very inviting.\nYes it's convenient if you're staying on the premises but if you can, go elsewhere. \nHoping that they're still trying to find they're footing and will improve from here.
2527	0	a	Stopped there twice over a period of 2 days mainly due to convenience as I was attending a conference at the Mirage. First day, ordered eggs and asked for fries instead of hash browns. Food turned up twenty minutes later with hash browns. Mentioned to the server that I had asked for french fries and was told that they would bring me an order of fries. Twenty five minutes later, no sign of the fries but the server did explain that as this is a new restaurant, the kitchen does not like substitutions and tends to just send out whatever is on the menu. Cancelled the fries, paid and left. Following day, stopped in for lunch. Ordered a bacon cheese burger, plain with fries. Order was taken by the same server as the previous day who recognized me and assured me it would be right this time. Twenty minutes later, out comes my burger with everything on it (apart from the bacon). Sent the whole meal back this time and five minutes later it was returned and everything looked ok although they had obviously just scraped everything off. Took a bite, not ok. They had melted the cheese on the burger over a liberal helping of onions which I had not noticed and that also do not agree with me at all. Called my server who offered another burger and waived the charges for the original one when I refused. Bottom line, if you do not want the meal EXACTLY as it is described on the menu, find somewhere else.
2528	0	a	"The food here is decent and alone would earn Pantry three stars in my book. But the service is so remarkably bad that I can barely justify a one-star review. \n\nBefore I even sat down, my waiter tried to get me to pay $5 for water.  (\""It's in a big bottle you can pour for yourself!\"") I declined. \""So what do you want to drink?\"" I still had not sat down, let alone had an opportunity to review the menu. \n\nI ordered steak and eggs from one of the three or four waiters buzzing around. I still have no idea who, if anyone, was my actual waiter. It took awhile to get the dish out, but unlike my waiters, I was in no hurry to get myself out of the restaurant. Again, the food is decent--and decently priced by Vegas standards, too. \n\nI probably wouldn't have had a chance to try it if my wife didn't stop a waiter from clearing my plate while I got up for less than a minute. I had to tell waiters three times that I did not want my plate taken off the table. I would have gladly taken a refill of my not-five-dollar-self-serve water, but none of the wait staff seemed to notice or care about that. \n\nThe final straw, however, was the fourth plate-grab. A waiter interrupted me in the middle of a sentence, grabbed my plate, and asked if he could take it. The plate was still 75 percent full, and I had my fork in the air prepared to take a bite at the time. From start to finish, we were in Pantry for 40 minutes--about twenty five of which were spent waiting for our meal. If the sole goal of Pantry is to get customers out the door, they succeeded wildly. So successful that I will never walk IN their door again, either."
2529	0	a	I stopped by this restaurant and was told that it was going to close at 9pm for weekly cleaning but they would resume their 24/7 schedule the following day.  The next night I went in after midnight and the place was almost empty.  It was a weekday though.  I wanted to order food to go and was directed to the bar.  I ordered the fish and chips.  It took about 20 minutes or so for the food.  The restaurant is located feet from the hotel elevators so I expected hot, fresh food when I got to my room.  I was really disappointed though.  The French fries were soggy and lukewarm.  The fish should have had a crunchy batter but was soggy, just like the fries.  It was fairly hot but not that tasty.  For $20 plus tax and tip I really expected more than one soggy piece of fish.  I think that my food probably sat in the kitchen for a while before it was delivered to me.  There is no way that the piece of fish had just came out of a fryer.  If I ever go back I would stick with breakfast.  I can't really speak to the service.  The hostess and the bartender were not unfriendly but really didn't do anything to make me feel welcome.
2530	0	a	"The worst experience in many many years. Ordered breakfast of steak and eggs. Asked for over medium eggs and a medium cooked steak. The eggs were at best sunny side up with yoke and whites still runny. The steak looked like shoe leather that had been in the sun for years. The meal was not appealing nor edible. The waitress made excuses and acted as though I was crazy for sending the meal back without \""trying\"" it first. I saw enough to know I was not eating it. \n\nSent it back. After 30-40 minutes and the manager and condescending waitress the second attempt was delivered. Food was better but not worth the money. Steak was tough and lacked flavor. \n\nDo not waste your time eating here. You will be disappointed and pissed."
2531	0	a	First we waited in line for 30 minutes. When we finally got inside , we ordered our food with NO PORK. The waitress comes with our food after waiting FOREVER and guess what PORK on my omelet. So I had to wait again for another 30 minutes. While I was waiting I tried the others food. Ahhhh..... hardly better than I hop. When my omelet with no pork came I ended putting it to go. So I ask for a bag and there's a BUTTERFLY inside. I completely lost my appetite. We call the UNPROFESSIONAL manager and she was no help. We ended up pay full price for bad service and ok food and a butterfly inside my bag. We tipped low $..Probably too much. And I'm taking  my time on vacation just to WARN you guys not to go here.
2532	0	a	"My wife and I had a late meal after the LOVE show last night. We waited in line for about 10 minutes just to get a table. Once seated we were asked for our drink orders. We selected two glasses of wine, a Pinot Noir and waters. It took another 5 minutes more to get our water glasses filled. When our waitress came over to take our meal order another 5 minutes later, she mentioned that they were out of the wine we selected. We order a Merlot as a replacement. My wife ordered the daily soup and grilled cheese sandwich. I ordered the \""Backyard Burger\"" and a side of clam chowder. The waitress asked me if I wanted the soup out separate of my burger which I said I could have them brought together. The same question was not asked of my wife. About 10 minutes later our food arrived and when we asked about our wine, the person delivering our food (which was not our waitress), had no clue that we had ordered wine. My wife told this person to cancel the wine order since we had hoped to drink our wine before our meal was served. When I cut into my burger it was medium rare (bright red). I had ordered it as a \""medium\"". I flagged down a bus person who took it back to the kitchen to fix a new burger. A few minutes later, the manager came out with two glasses of wine and apologized for the issue with our drink order. He also said that the meat was how they cooked it for \""medium\"" but would redo it as \""medium well\"". The new burger was OK but even at \""medium well' there was still some pink to the inside. \n\nWe finished our meal and got our check. As we were reviewing the charges, we realized that the wine we did get was charged at $14. My wife called over and got a copy of the drink menu only to find that the wine we did order was only $12 per glass. We flagged down our waitress to have her fix the bill. She took it back to the manager and shortly afterwards got a new bill with $4 discount applied. We paid the bill and left.\n\nAs convenient this new restaurant is for Mirage guests, the service and food quality are not worth it. \n\nAlso it would be nice if the employees had name tags so they could be indentfied as working at the restaurant instead of trying to get someone's attention to ask for our waiter/waitress."
2533	0	a	Unfortunately, I was disappointed with Mirage's 24 hour restaurant! \n\nThe ambiance is really nice, looks like a trendy country kitchen, it's very comfortable and a nice place to have breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Also, each booth is equipped with two usb outlets and two electrical outlets. \n\nHowever, the service and food does not compare with the great ambiance. The staff is inattentive and most of the time food came out cold. It always seemed like the restaurant was understaffed. \n\n*Do not get the steak and eggs. I asked for medium well and it came out well done and crispy. Also, you do not get a full steak. You get steak bites. Small steak bites
2534	0	a	I was not impressed with the food at all. The only good thing I can say about this place is that it is open 24 hours and after a night out on the town, they promptly had our to-go food ready in less than 15 minutes. It could be that we ordered items that weren't on the breakfast menu and maybe it was our own fault for not following what others on yelp recommended.\n\nWe ordered: \nFried chicken Brussels sprouts - Flavorless, but the batter was crunchy\nPork Chops - Strange Batter that was Sweet and Salty?  \nFried Chicken - Dry and overcooked with no flavor\nFries - Fresh and Crispy\n\nThe portions were extremely generous, but it lacked flavor.  We didn't even finish half what we ordered despite how hungry we were after David Guetta :)
2535	0	a	Hostess was in a daze, empty tables and tons of servers running around, 2 bartenders and SUPER slow service. We purposely ordered salads so it would be quick and took 25 minutes (i knew because i used my check in time stamp on yelp) for us to get salads. \nFood was good, but don't be in a rush.
2536	0	a	Not worth the wait..walk a little further to the coffee shop! We didn't wait too long, 15 minutes which wasn't unusual, however our dining experience was a different story. First they give me a teapot which turned out to be just hot water, which I thought it happens people often forget the tea bag. We waited about 30 minutes for our food to come out, oh wait I mean for my dish and my sons. My husbands dish actually didn't make it to our table until 15 minutes later.  They have fruit loops on the menu but the waitress didn't tell us that they were out we found out when the server brought a different type of cereal, we of course sent it back for something our son would eat. Maybe I'm being difficult but I thought when a restaurant runs out of something they 1) notify the customer and 2) tells them what the options are?! The worst part was that my son and and got our food and my husbands dish never appeared, we had to ask the hostess to get the manager, since our waitress was no where to be found, and the manager, who was apologetic (reason for 2 stars) went to the kitchen and brought his dish, keep in mind the dish made it to our table when me and my son were both done with our food, and those of you who have been around a five year old know how restless kids get. Needless to say we will never be back.
2537	0	a	Not worth it. Cute atmosphere, turkey sandwich wasn't bad but grilled cheese was very plain and not worth $13. Came in at 1am to get food to go and took over 30 minutes and they were already out of the first three things we tried to order on the menu. First server behind the bar wasn't very friendly, which kind of set the tone. Second blonde male server that assisted us was better.
2538	0	a	Overall the experience but fine. No real complications or concerns. \n\nThe potato-carrot mash was amazing once I added more butter. The fried chicken was a bit greasy inside for my liking. \n\nOne of my roommate's ordered the fish and chips and simply said meh. \n\nMy other roommate ordered the steak and fries. While the steak was delicious, the fries left a lot to be desired. \n\nThe homemade jelly on the table was excellent. Extra sad I couldn't buy a jar or take a sample home. Something about labels being needed and it being available for sale soon.\n\nBest part of the meal was the pretzel I ordered and dipped in the apple jelly!!!
2539	1	a	I have been waiting for this place to open for a longgggg time now. Finally went tonight and I ordered the pot stickers and pad kee Mao. The pot stickers are great! Nice and not soggy. I ordered a level 8 and I don't think it was very spicy at all. So next time I will need to get a 9 or 10. I used to go to Gaati but they have new owners and it is just not the same. So far I like this place. Hopefully this will be my new Thai spot.
2540	1	a	So happy a good thai place has opened closeby. It was around 4 when I went and it wasn't busy but I knew that they had just recently opened their restaurant. I ordered the basil chicken and it was really good! The service was fast and the guy working was really nice, always a plus.
2541	1	a	The Lucky chicken appetizer is a fried chicken wings and drummettes in a special sauce, good but nothing special. The pineapple fried rice is very good. Phad see ewe is also very good, in line with other Thai places. We're from Seattle and would come here again.
2542	1	a	Went again tonight and tried the chicken curry. Again I had a fantastic meal. I ordered a 10 for spice level and it wasn't quite a 10 but I do understand at a certain point there is a trade off between spicy and flavorful and my dish did not disappoint there. It was delicious and I even had enough left over for lunch tomorrow. \n\nAgain I had great service and the staff was friendly.  The food and staff set it apart from the other Thai restaurants in the area and their prices make it a great destination for frequent visits.
2543	1	a	Great service, came in and ordered take out.\nHaven't tried to call.\nThings done wrong: curry was in a form container and it spilled a bunch/beef jerky was dry/why does every thai place skimp on white rice?\nAfter all that still 5 stars because,\nThings done right: all of it tasted awesome, dried jerky and all/right price each thing around 9$/enough for lunch tomorrow/server spoke english well\n\nOrdered pineapple chicken fried rice/basil vegetable fried rice/panag vegetable curry/beef jerky.\n\nDefinitely going back!
2544	1	a	Just ordered to go and just finished eating so here's what we think! Ordered red curry chicken, Mongolian beef, crab rangoons and beef jerky. We got a five and six spicy but will probably order higher next time but the lady gave extra chili so it worked out perfectly. The beef jerky was really tender and the crab rangoons were delish. Long story short ALL of the 4 things were very tasty and full of flavor. This is by far the best thai food around (ive eaten a lot of thai food too)and can't beat the prices too! $35 for everything. Will definitely be bl going back
2545	0	a	Over priced really bad Thai food.  Don't waste your time even trying it.  We were at the grocery store and walked out and decided to give it a try.  The soup was lukewarm.  Most of the vegetables weren't even cooked.  For what we ended up paying there and what we got we will never go back.
2546	1	a	Came here based on Yelp reviews, and it lived up to the hype! Pad thai was excellent, and my wife's yellow curry was really good as well!
2547	0	a	"Food is decent and pretty much same as any Thai restaurant. Rated one star due to a delivery request. Person on the line mentioned they deliver only 3 miles away. I had mentioned that I much less than that, 2 miles to be exact. Then he mentioned \""we do not deliver in your area\""..... I was instantly disappointed."
2548	1	a	Great neighborhood Thai spot.  Simple one page menu that has all your main staples without a lot of frills.  Loved the spicey basil chicken it had a good balance of flavors and texture. The steamed fish was amazing. We chose the lime sauce and it had so many layers of flavor. A great choice if you want flavor but can't handle spice. The fish was tender yet firm.  The Thai ice tea was probably one of my favorite, it didn't have that butter after taste you sometimes find, and was not overly sweet.  Yellow vegetable curry had great varied textures, perfectly cooked potatoes, and the curry was very satisfying.\n\nThe service was very polite and attentive, and the place was not to busy and loud on a Sunday night, so we all could enjoy each others company without yelling over others.\n\nI did feel although the chicken satay was tender the peanut sauce was overly salty and one dimentional, and the chicken in the pad Thai was over cooked. and sadly not tender like the satay, but the flavor was good. Calamari was nothing special and wouldn't really recommend it.  Despite that I will be back again for sure. It is close to my house, over all yummy, chill and quiet, and will not break the bank.
2549	1	a	Pleasantly surprised by the great food and excellent prices.  Smallish and intimate restaurant...has about 8 tables.  We came here and tried four dishes.  All of them were full of flavor, generous portions and perfectly cooked.  Service was attentive and friendly.
2550	0	a	Strange so many stars. Food was almost average. Tea cups had left over food on them. Had to ask for a spoon and a spice tray. No fish sauce on spice tray. Only 2 tables seated. The manager and or owner went for smoke in front of the restaurant twice. Our waiter had some sort of black ink or grease on his hands. P. S. I have been to Thailand more than 20 times... We will stay home and make our own Thai food. Let me know if you want some real Thai food. You can make a reservation at our house. No Drama!  I approve this message J K KUHL..
2551	1	a	Well well, an Izakaya on this side of town? Sign me up! Over the past few weeks I waited patiently for Yatai to open up so I could see if it was going to be a hit. \n\nMy friend and I came in around 10 p.m. after work and it was empty, thats to be expected at this late of an hour. The staff were extra friendly and greeted us as soon as we came in, the tv playing a mixture of K-pop And SNSD singing in Japanese. We ordered a few yakitori parts such as hearts and livers, cow tongues. The menu was huge! So it might just take a little while to go through it all. The cucumber salad was nice and the Shioyaki salmon came out moist and delicious . All in all the food was good and the prices are very fare.
2552	1	a	Great lashes!
2553	0	a	realized they forgot my fish sandwich and Mc-chicken after i got home. Called back several time, no one ever picked up the phone. What do you do in this situation? i wonder i will ever got my food/money back... sign...
2554	0	a	They reduced their sizes drastically. The mcflurry is unrecognizable, and for the same price too. Disappointed.
2555	1	a	Oh Em Gee. This was such an amazing and fabulous event! I got my behind thoroughly kicked at Orange Theory and then had amazingly delicious food from the super sweet and awesome people at Flower Child - gotta remember to go back there, it was pretty awesome. Let me start with Orange Theory - I was nervous going into it as I am not a runner (haven't run since... I dunno.... April maybe) and I don't lift weights typically. I was right to be scared, this place is not messing around. I was sweating and panting... it was almost a little embarrassing, but so good! I started on the treadmill (for 30 minutes.... I was dying), where they talk you through intervals of running and jogging. That was followed by the rowing machine and a series of simple exercises using mostly everyday equipment (dumbbells, push ups, sit ups with medicine balls, etc). The burn was real. I burned almost 500 calories... which was good cuz I ate at least that much after at Flower Child. I hadn't tried this place yet, but it was legit. The food is mostly local, organic, and lightly seasoned as to let the flavors of the food shine through. The people who worked there were so helpful in navigating the menu and so generous with the food. I had a great green tea, the amazingly delicious avocado hummus (I wanted to lick the bowl), and the sesame beef bowl (this thing had a great Asian flavor without obscuring the taste of the vegetables and the high quality steak). It was also huge, at least 2 meals worth. I got to try their delicious carrot/veg juice (I could get down with that on a regular basis), their green juice (good, but standard green/kale juice), and the kombucha (surprisingly good... never tried it before so I have no comparison). I'm not gonna lie, I totally drank some of the unfinished juices from friends (thanks guys!). We even got dessert to take home. The best part, though, was the friendly and personable nature of the staff... it really was impressive. I will be back! Thank you Lindsey and Yelp for an amazing day, you guys are the best!!!
2556	1	a	"Oh testosterone-loaded, sexy and beastly abs of Rich Froning . . .  THIS WAS SO MUCH FUN! Most fun I've had on a Sunday in ages!\n\nI have always wanted to try a workout at Orange Theory. So was super pumped to see Lindsey posting an event on a Sunday afternoon. \n\nNow, Sunday is usually my rest day. I log 20-35 hours a week training for hammer throw (Track & Field) in addition to 40+ hour work weeks. So a day with Netflix and a glass of wine and a cheat meal becomes more than a necessity.\n\nAgainst my Coach's advice (and some teasing for going to do a \""Hamster Workout\""), I gave rest day a giant middle finger.

Just a mix of resistance exercises in blocks with some rowing thrown in and some running on the treadmill. The DREADMILLS were just as torturous as anticipated (I run outside, damnit, it's natural!). The concept was: Find your Base Pace, a Push Pace, and an All Out effort for 40-90 seconds (could be wrong, brains were lacking oxygen). \n\nOTF Arcadia e-mailed us the workout results super fast. It was nice to see I burned over 700 calories and kept my HR in the Orange Zone for over half the workout! \n\nWas it tough? You bet! I'm in great shape, and I am foam-rolling / therabanding the right foot and ankle / icing my stupid arthritic knee / hating life as this review is being typed. WHOMP!  \n\nWould I sign up for a place like this? No way. It is a killer workout, no doubt, but machine based workouts aren't my jam, and that's OK. \n\nBig thank you and a zillion high fives to trainer Eric and fellow Yelpers for tolerating Lisa E. and I's jackassery: \""A-Skipping\"" it up on treadmills, dancing on treadmills, and general rowdiness - Hey now! It's important to encourage your workout pals to hustle to build that muscle. And it makes the workout suck less. \n\nThe food at Flower Child was delicious. Indulgently healthy, and the perfect post-workout recovery meal! Can't wait to bring friends back. It was nice to sit, chat, and catch up with Yelp Pals. \n\nTried the Mediterranean Salad with Salmon as the protein. Everything was so fresh, allowing for the flavors of the food to be the star without a whole lot extra junk added. The salad was lightly dressed in an Oregano Vinaigrette. \n\nThe Pomegranate Pear Lemonade was refreshing; could have taken a gallon of that stuff home. \n\nWe got to try the Kombucha and Kale Juices . . . Pst . . . Kombucha is on TAP here! \n\nAlso got to sample a few pastries, some avocado hummus with pita (about to try and recreate this!).  One of the employees hooked us up with some samples of their gluten-free mac and cheese. Had to resist not eating the whole plate. It was that good! \n\nAlso, the parting gift of the mini cakes were much appreciated! \n\nAll in all, a wonderful Sunday. It was a surprise to see an activity-centric event posted, and look forward to hopefully seeing more in the future (Hot Yoga?! Maybe a CrossFit fundamentals class?! That'd be dope!). \n\nWell done, Lindsey, OTF Arcadia and Flower Child for having us. Y'all did a stellar job hosting this event!"
2557	1	a	So are we supposed to put our reviews here, or on the page of the businesses? I'm just going to go rogue and post to their page.\n\nIn other news, I'm thinking about making a trip down to my local ER. I've somehow contracted a serious case of Sponge Legs. Good thing I have a Lemon Cake to make me feel better.\n\nAnd kudos to that psychopath Mike who never left the red zone. What a monster.\n\nHad a fantastic time, nice to meet you all and thanks to Lindsey for setting up such a novel and ass-kicking event. Never did any yelp event like this in Miami. Made my weekend.
2558	1	a	Out of shape or in shape, Yelp kicked our butts!   Yelpers were treated to a 60 minute class which included treadmill (power walking or running), rowing and various on floor exercises with a ball and bench.  A monitor was strapped to our chests to report the results which was pretty cool! I did better than I expected. \n\nFor someone that goes to the gym 2 to 3 times a week, this one really kicked my butt and it was great to have trainer there to push your limit even when you don't want to.  My abs are sore, my legs felt like jelly and I feel asleep by 8 p.m. , thank you Eric, thank you.   \n\nThe only thing I really wanted to find out, but didn't was how much are the classes.  I would consider doing a class maybe two times a month, if it was reasonable.  \n\nFlower Child, was really good and since it's not far from my house I will be going probably once a month.  The prices were reasonable for what you receive and the quality of the food is top notch.  \n\n\nI had steak, brown rice and the wild mushrooms with brussel sprouts..sounds really dull compared to other Yelpers' dishes, but it was really good.  The avocado hummus spread is to die for and I had to ask for more pieces of bread..can't waste! \n\nThank you for the invite, it was a great event and more Yelp events should be like this...well maybe not all!
2559	1	a	I love this kind of events.  We got to try a new (to me) workout experience.  It was a lot of fun working out along side some cool fellow yelpers.  I am glad I started with cardio.  The second part of the workout was weights so my legs were a little wobbly afterwards.  Following our workout, we were invited to enjoy a meal at Flower Child.  I love, love this concept.   I had the chopped vegetable salad with steak.  It was delicious.  I sampled a bite of the avocado humus, also amazing.  They sent us home with a delicious little cake, I heard that from my husband and kids since I am on a no carbs diet for the moment.\nThank you to Lindsey for putting yet another wonderful event in coordination with  Orange Theory Fitness and Flower Child.
2560	0	a	This store is horrible and way over priced. I received a Christmas gift from there and it was way too big. The sales associate actually convinced my mom into buying the larger top. I wear a medium and am busty, but an extra large is offensive and looked awful on me. I wanted to exchange the top, but the owner would not let me. Avoid this store. Just go to Savers or Buffalo Exchane.
2561	0	a	I use to love this place When I first started to go there last year. Now I agree with previous reviewer. Owner is very rude. I did 2 consignment clothing there. On this last trip getting final payment she was completely rude and insulting to me on the phone when I called about money do to me. Insulted me when I wanted to pick up my clothing and my final payment. She said I was one of the few who would come back worried about picking up their clothes and getting their final payment. Of course they are my clothes and my money!! I have purchased clothes ... taken friends and family and recommended them. The only reason I can think of why she would take offense at me picking up my clothes, is the contract said if you do not pick them up they become the property of fashion exchange. I have seen many tags outdated long pass the 90 day contract. This means When she sells the clothes left behind she makes 100% profit. Very unethical rude. I will not set foot in the store again nor would I ever recommend any friends family or neighbors to go there. There are many other nice places in town that treat you respectfully. I will be taking my business to ritzy rags down the street.
2562	1	a	The food was really good. I had chicken enchiladas de mole. They have Mexican coke!!! It's all authentic. Great place for lunch during the work day!!!
2563	1	a	Had a great lunch here today.  Ordered the Carne Asada, Barbacoa and Carnitas tacos and everything was very fresh and delicious.  Glad to have this addition to the downtown lunch options.
2564	0	a	"Wow... We didn't think a sandwich could be this pitiful. Somehow, these funny named little fellas found a way!  Tasteless \""French\"" bread combined with scant meat and scarcely any toppings makes for an unhappy patron.  The only minor bright spot in the meal was the soup, but then again, when you pay close to $13.00 for a wich combo, cup of soup and a drink, you certainly expect something better!  We would say that this is mostly on par with Subway only for half the amount of food and almost twice the cost.  We certainly wish Erbert & Gerbert's all the best and hope our experience was just an opening day fluke! These new 5 star reviews seem totally contrived, but we'll be back in about a month or two to check and see."
2565	1	a	I've been coming to E&G pretty much every day since they opened up here. \n\nI had never been to an Erbert & Gerbert's until I moved out here, and I'm glad that I finally got to experience them.\n\nThe atmosphere is friendly and welcoming, clean and looks good, the staff are always really cool and nice to me, and I see the manager up at the front talking to customers every time I've ever been.\n\nI've tried a few of the sandwiches and surprisingly I've liked them all quite a bit! Even the PB&J! \n\nTonight I got the Narmer but substituted the regular mayo for their pesto mayo and added their tasty peppadew mustard. I'd never had peppadew before coming here, and now I can't get enough!\n\nI recommend this place to anyone looking for a good sandwich spot!
2566	0	a	Think of this as Jimmy Johns with wheat sub roll. The place is an exact copy of Jimmy Johns. From the menu, to the look, the atmosphere, even the receipt is similar. \n The sandwich was fine, nothing special. the strange part was that they give you the inside of the bread that they removed (see pic). I didn't need it but it was different. \n This location probably won't last because there is an actual Jimmy Johns on Mill that will get all the passers by. This location is not in a very accessible location when there is a lot of traffic. \n E & G's is good if you are walking by and need a quick sandwich but don't make a special trip.
2567	1	a	This is my favorite sub shop EVER!!! I am from the Midwest and lived off Erbs and Gerbs during college in Minnesota, and I am sooooo happy this store is down here in Tempe.  All of their subs are phenomenal and their soup is out of this world! Check them out, seriously,  you will NOT be disappointed!
2568	0	a	Was working at the  Tempe Festival and this was the closest restaurant to my booth. Ordered a turkey sandwich. It was ready in two minutes!  Wow I was impressed. Took one bite and I almost cried. All it had was mayo And lettuce. Couldn't tell what I was eating if I closed my eyes.  Two slices of processed meat and one slice of cheese. I should have asked for a refund.  I was starving so I was forced to eat half. Gave the other half to a street dude who looked hungry.  I predict this place will be closed when I return for the spring show in March. With all of the restaurant closings on Mill Ave in the last two years, this place doesn't stand a chance.  I saw at least six new places from when I was here six months ago. No clue why this place is even open for business. I hate Subway and this place is worse. For real
2569	0	a	"It appears that anybody can open a sandwich shop and use poor quality ingredients and suddenly they are a nationwide chain of crappy sub shops, aka Subway. This place takes it to another level with really stupid sandwich names and then if you start reading some of the combination of ingredients on the menu, the situation gets even worse. Nothing sounded good and they use good ole' deli sliced (read - Oscar Meyer quality) turkey and other B list ingredients. Also, what is with taking the filling out of my bread? I always make fun of those people and I open my sandwich and my bread innards are laying next to my lame sandwich. I know that's your \""thing\"", but at least gimme a choice. It is my bread and after all since I'm paying. In addition, they also forgot to put avocado on my veggie sub. Ironically, as I was ordering a group of folks were marching outside concerning the recent police actions. I was secretly hoping that this store would get looted, but no luck, so just avoid this poor excuse for a sub shop."
2570	1	a	HAPPY FEET!!!!!   Jason Allison, the owner/operator, cleaned our entire home of tile floor & sealed the grout.  The results were unbelievable!  FLOORS LOOK NEW!   Walking around the house has never felt so good to our feet!!  We just arrived at our new to us home from out of state & the floors were filthy.  So blessed I saw his ad in coffee news!!  Jason was a delight to speak with on the phone & I knew he was the man for the job!  He was a diligent worker.  Jason has an eye for stain spots.  Plus, he was very careful with moving furniture.   I truly am amazed to have found such a hard worker who takes pride in his work!!!  His truck was amazingly clean as were his hoses. This acronym bests describes Jason Allison.....\nHonest\nAffordable\nPersonable/Prompt\nPerfectionistic\nYour guy for carpet & tile cleaning\nJason takes care of YOUR FLOORS as if they were his own!  Never have I had such a pleasant experience with someone who CARES about his line of work!!!   Jason was a God send to me!  :)
2571	1	a	So I called Jason with an emergency,  on the way home from water store I had to slam on my brakes,  3 of my 5 gallon water bottles had burst!   Water flooded the floor of my minivan.  Fearing mildew and rust I knew it had to get taken car of right away.   I called Jason and no joke 15 minutes later he was taking care of business!   He used super cool equipment to suck tons of water out and then cleaned my seats and carpets.   He even was able to remove a tar stain that had been there for over a year!   The inside of my van looks brand new, no stains,  melted crayons are gone, permanent black marker is gone.  Desert Palms is no joke,  I totally regret hiring someone else to do my home carpets last week!
2572	0	a	Food poisoning. Ate there last night and have been to the bathroom 20+ times since. I feel like garbage. Will not be eating here again.
2573	0	a	I found this place on Google for Chinese Food delivery. It's only a few miles down the road from me. I called and ordered three things. Two lunch specials and bbq spare ribs appetizer. I was told It would be admit thirty minutes. An hour goes by, I call and ask where the food was. Lady assured me driver was out and delivering. Almost two hours later I called again because no one had shown up. I had to argue with the woman to cancel my order and refund my money. She wanted to give me free food for next order. Like i would order from here again? She finally agreed to refund my money. Literally thirty seconds after we had hung up, the driver arrived. I told him I cancelled because he was two hours late and to leave. He assured me the food was hot. Yeah right. I closed the door and heard him screaming outside of my house into his phone. NEVER ORDER DELIVERY HERE.
2574	0	a	After reading these reviews I was sadly disappointed. The fact that no Asians were eating there when I was should have been a clue.  The food was absolutely the worst excuse for Chinese I have ever had the displeasure of not being able to finish. I suppose there are trade offs. The old Jade House had great food but terrible service. This place has terrible everything. I give them 6 months max and they will be done unless they hire a new kitchen staff.
2575	1	a	I ordered duck soup and Szechwuan style boiled fish and beef. The dishes are very traditional. The food are fresh and very delicious!
2576	1	a	So I walked into the very cheerful cashier and ordered the Banana Berry Acai Bowl, made from freshness in front of you, awesome. This frozen treat is topped with granola and fresh sweet fruit. Recommend to anyone looking to try something new and delicious.
2577	1	a	I got the pb bowl as a blended smoothie! The girl working was so nice and made it special for me. I highly recommend it. Watch out for the blonde guy though - he can be moody! Lol
2578	1	a	Mon Ami just opened yesterday.  Ordered some fried chicken, spicy pork stir fry and steamed dumplings to go.  Fried chicken was amazing. Light, not greasy at all, extra crispy and very high quality pieces of meat.  Spicy pork stir fry was outstanding, nice and spicy, and the steamed dumplings were extremely fresh and delicious.  Waitstaff were friendly and prices were very reasonable.  This place is a gem!  I really hope it sticks around.
2579	1	a	I've eaten here a couple of times now- taking food to eat at home. I never associated Korean restaurants and fried chicken, but theirs is amazing- I haven't had such good chicken in years. The meat is high quality, the fry is crisp and not greasy, and the portions are generous. I also had a pork and kim chee stew- it also included mushrooms, tofu, and some vegetables. It was nice and spicy and loaded with ingredients. Definitely a favorite now. I haven't tried the lunch specials but they look good and super cheap. The counter staff have been friendly and helpful (they talked me out of ordering ramen as takeout because they felt the noodles wouldn't hold up). The menu has some more exotic offerings as well- looking forward to trying more. This area of Somerled hasn't had a Korean restaurant - so this is a perfect addition to the neighborhood.
2580	0	a	I guess fried chicken is the only way to go at this place. My friend and I tried two of their noodle dishes and both were so disappointing. His was the spicy octopus dish - the octopus was tough and practically inedible. I had the black bean noodles - a gloopy and tasteless mess of a plate. So sad. I really wanted to like this place.
2581	1	a	When I read about this restaurant I knew we had to try it. We were generally pleased. The flatbread was great. Our friend enjoyed her panini. My wife enjoyed the mozzarella taster. I got clam linguini and was happy with it. My wife  liked her dessert but I don't remember which it was. There was a decent selection of wine. We shared a good Sicilian white. I thought the wines a little overpriced. Service was slow. It was an hour and forty minutes from arrival to departure. We were not in a great hurry but...  There were problems with paying. The waiter forgot to charge for the wine. I sometimes feel I am keeping servers solvent and restaurants in business with errors of this kind that I correct. I want to pay for what I consume. We paid with two credit cards. I was to pay 2/3 and our friend 1/3 and the waiter held each card and recited it back. There were problems dividing the bill and our friend ended up with 2/3 not us. We will work it out but it was frustrating. Finally, going through this site during lunch I realized that happy hour was started before we arrived but no mention was made of it. If this menu is available I feel it should be offered. I feel as if it was concealed to get us to buy a more expensive lunch. Perhaps I am wrong. We will be back.  We like Tomaso's so should eventually see this turn into a great place for a meal.
2582	0	a	"This place was authentic Italian food, so authentic that no one we spoke to understood English. We ordered a pizza with a side of ranch. The waiter did not understand when I said ranch, and my request was ignored. Ordered salads and a pasta dish. The pizza was a good portion size which is why I give the place two stars. The pasta was a smaller size so we requested another salad to accompany it, the guy did not understand us when we asked for another salad, he kept pointing to the salt and saying \""salt\"" and we kept saying no salad, we had to point to a salad and say \""salad\"". The service was very slow. It took about 15-20 minutes to have anyone take our order. A table was seated about 10 minutes after ours and the waiter went there first. There was so much confusion at the tables and there were only 3 other tables, so it was not like the place was packed. It took another 40-45 minutes for our food to come out. The food was good, but they definitely need work on the service."
2583	1	a	Drive by this place quite often during the week and when I saw the Grand Opening banner I knew I had to check it out.  Took my boss for lunch and I am so very happy that we decided to celebrate the day at Vivo.  We started with salads and the caprese starter.  The boss and I split a pizza which was amazing and the salads were fresh and tasty.  The wine was incredible and the tirimasu we had for desert was absolutely divine.  I can see several more work lunches happening at Vivo in the very near future.  If you are in the mood for authentic Italian pizza and friendly service I cannot recommend this place enough.  Bravo Vivo!
2584	1	a	Second visit: came specifically for happy hour as it existed previous visit a week before. This was partly about price but mostly because there were some interesting menu items for happy hour but not on lunch menu.  Unfortunately happy hour has been rescheduled. We debated going elsewhere but ended up staying and had a good lunch. It is a little expensive with prices being in the $12 to $20 range for salads, sandwiches and entrees. There is a decent wine list with reds mostly in the $10-15 range which also seems a little overpriced. Service was friendly but when we had a problem it was difficult getting waiter's attention. At 2 p.m. there was one other table and a handful of people at the bar so it wasn't busy.
2585	1	a	This place is very new, and it is really wonderful!  I love the location and the food so much!  You can make reservations, though they aren't too busy during the week, but I haven't been there on a weekend so I can't speak to that.  I've tried one of their pastas as well as their pizza and both were delicious!  I can't wait to try more on their menu in the future because their food is awesome.  The atmosphere is really great, high ceilings, a nice bar with lots of seating, free standing tables on one side and large booths on another, it is altogether laid out very well.  I also like that it is modern looking on the inside, no tacky Italian-esque decor from Target here, the design is really well done.  I've always had great service here, the servers are nice and attentive, and they can answer any questions you may have.  The location of this restaurant is also great in that it is close to Old Town Scottsdale, but far enough away so that you can find a parking spot and you don't have to deal with hoards of crowds.
2586	1	a	Great Italian restaurant next door to that ridiculous sumo Maya. The atmosphere is nice and it's a very pretty restaurant. The wine list is extensive...5 pages I believe. They have a ton of specials and they all sounded very good. I would recommend the pizza, I had the Capricciosa and it was delicious. The pizza dough had a fantastic taste and all the ingredients were fresh. The rest of my party ordered entrees and although none had complaints about the taste, it was a little over priced for what you get. The happy hour menu looks great so we will be going back for that and we will be going back for pizza. I would highly recommend Vivo for the pizza.
2587	1	a	I've never been to Italy, but this is probably the closest you'll come to eating a fine Italian meal in the valley of the sun. Freshness and quality, combined with great service make this restaurant a gem to behold in the rich culinary diversity of Scottsdale.\n\nRight upon seating you are served some fresh toasted bread drizzled with olive oil. The bread slices were perfect, a good balance of crisp crust with soft, slightly chewy center. The olive oil was high quality and was very flavorful.\n\nWe ordered a variety of dishes, from pizza, to a remarkable seafood platter, to pasta. I ordered the black pasta. The pasta itself is hand made fresh, with the addition of squid ink to give it its signature dark color. I was excited to try this dish out since I've never had squid ink pasta before, and I was impressed. The pasta was cooked perfectly, with a slight salty, deep briny flavor. It went well with the sauce, langostinos, and scallops. I also tried some of the margherita pizza, which was superbly executed with a thin, crispy crust and lovely toppings. I also tried part of a meatball which was perfectly seasoned, with a delightful soft texture. My friend that had the impressive seafood platter (Lobster, clams, scallops, and possibly more!) enjoyed his meal overall, but did remark that the clams were gritty.\n\nService was very polite and impeccable. Drinks were refilled quite often, and we were checked on as needed.\n\nParking in this plaza is a bit of a pain since there are limited spots, but they do make up for it by offering free valet.\n\nThis is definitely a new favorite for Italian food for me!
2588	1	a	Great new restaurant!  Atmosphere & food as close to perfect as it can get.\nPricing is fair for the portion size.Tommy has another winner!
2589	1	a	Wanted to find a new Italian restaurant and a couple of friends suggested Vivo. I'm so grateful they did! We had a delicious dinner tonight and we'll definitely be back! \n\nI started with the Lobster Bisque and it was awesome! Definitely worth the $11 price! Enjoyed the yummy Veal Piccata,  followed by the Tiramisu. Hubby and father-in-law both had the homemade pasta with meatballs. Brother-in-law had the salmon and son had the Black Linguine with Langostino Lobster and Scallops. Amazing! \n\nThe service was excellent - zero complaints. Thank you Vivo!
2590	0	a	"The food at Firehouse is always great - at least there is some consistency there!   This is my second time in the new Buckeye location.. The service here is pretty terrible.  The employees seem so unhappy to be working there!  It was my friend's first time in, but no one bothered to explain the process to her. Such a shame considering I'm guessing there are a lot of first time guests to firehouse here in buckeye.  Our cashier was Emily.. She seemed knowledgeable, but disinterested and unhappy.  Sam was the girl in the dining room while we were there.  She was quick to offer to pre-bus my table even though I had food left.  On the flip side, my friend wanted a to-go container and had to go to the counter to get it.  We saw a manager (or someone of authority wearing a FH shirt) come in during our lunch.  It was actually comical to hear/see the difference in the enthusiasm of the employees after he came in.  The \""welcome to firehouse\"" all of a sudden seemed to have some feeling behind it.  Also, where's the signage for the pickle buckets for sale? My friend made a comment that it seemed funny that there was trash sitting in front of the counter... Pretty sure those are some kind of fundraiser, right?  Anyway, I'm pretty bummed that the franchisee is losing out on such a great opportunity to make a great impression on people in buckeye who have very little quality restaurants to choose from.."
2591	1	a	This place is amazing for it just being a sub place. The inside it super cute and they have great customer service. A gentlemen working saw that my hands were full and opened the door and they don't make you wait long for you food either. They offer 120 drink choice and their own unsweetened tea. It was my first time and I loved my experience !!!
2592	0	a	not good at all !. 11$ a sub !
2593	1	a	Love this place!! Very reasonable prices.  Came during lunch and they were very good at getting order out fast.
2594	1	a	"I had the \""Calexico\"" pizza, it was delicious. This is wood fired pizza done right. The only reason I gave it four stars instead of five is that it's slightly confusing to order. You can get custom pizzas much the same way you would order at Subway or Chipotle. I picked the number I wanted but they still ask you if you want each ingredient on it. Simple enough, I just told them I want whatever comes with that number, I didn't see all of the toppings listed in the number available at the counter, but then I realized that the rest are \""finishers\"" which are applied after cooking and are available around the other side of the counter. Not really a big deal but now I know so I can try other finishers in the future. Staff was happy and friendly. They had a very small section of beer and wine on tap but I couldn't try them on my lunch break. I will be back!"
2595	0	a	"I came here on a Friday evening about 6:15. The place has a nice vibe, the employees are friendly, and the prices are wonderful. \nI ordered The Jasper and one of the strawberry desserts. The ingredients tasted fresh and everything had a good flavor. \nI'm giving the place two stars because the crust was terrible. It was extremely \""chewy.\"" It was like putting a tortilla in the microwave for 5 minutes. The crusty just ruined it for me. I always like thin crust pizza...but they usually are a bit crispy. This one tasted cheap (which it was!). \nI am glad I tried the place, but I have no desire to go back...and won't."
2596	1	a	Finally, something cool on this fairly dreadful but improving side of town.\n\nIn the new Metro Commons next to a new JOINT, Pot belly subs, Yogi's, a burger place I forgot the name of but there are a few of them around, and a soon to be new Yogurt shop, things are def. getting a little better out here.\n\nPizza is easy to order, kind of Subway-esque minus the dullness of an actual Subway.\nOrdered a couple different, one just pepperoni and one the Chicken Calexico?  Quite good, and wood fire oven fresh.  Crust was thin and crispy, a little burnt here and there just how I like it (TWSS).\n\nThe vibe is laid back with patio seating overlooking the scenic Peoria avenue rush hour traffic.  A stay pigeon also found this place, he was munching on some gluten free crust tossed away by a fairly overweight female patient, I mean customer.\n\nAlso they have a lovely devils ale on tap.  Totally cool.\n\nGood to see a few fresh kind of hipper places opening up around these here parts:)
2597	1	a	Guys, \n\nI don't even know the name of manager so I'm not a relative :) \n\nI'm from Beverly Hills and staying here in Phoenix for a while on a business trip.\n\nBelieve me, this place is gonna be a bucket list for Phoenix!\n\nEasy menu, personalized menu, fresh ingredients smiling at you over counter, best draft beer collection, extremely friendly and expert staff, minimum waiting time, easy access from freeway, and most important, sweet memories here!\n\nHere's my order:\nRed sauce with mozzarella cheese, Canadian bacon, mushroom, red onion, olives plus some fresh veggies and pesto after oven. \n\nI'm sorry I couldn't wait to take a picture so I ate the first slice  I'm a fan of orange blossom beer!
2598	0	a	"I think it only fair to lay out some background information before writing this review:\n\nFirst, I don't get the concept of \""thin crust\"" pizzas and I never will.  I wasn't impressed with them when Dominoes came up with the concept some 30 years ago and I'm still not.  Back in New York, a thin-crust pizza wasn't firm like a cracker and, thus, didn't hold up firmly when you put things on it.  It was doughy.  I admit to being a carboholic and the thicker the crust, the better (Go Sicilian!).  I call thin crust pizza \""Jewish Pizza\"", because it reminds me of putting toppings on top of a piece of matzoh (except matzoh's a bit thicker and doesn't fall apart like ashes if you grab it too hard).\n\nMOD Pizza's concept is simple:  come in and pick one of their pre-selected topping pizzas or make your own.  In that respect, not too different from Papa Murphy's.  The resemblance ends there.  Whereas my partner's white sauce pizza had lots of sauce on it; the guy making mine decided to \""spread\"" the sauce around with the ladle, thus making it thin (i.e., non existent).  My fault:  I could have said something.  Likewise, the woman making my friend's pizza was generous with toppings; my guy acted like they were making him pay for every topping he sprinkled on my pizza.\n\nThe pizza is good; especially if you're a fan of the as-solid-as-air crust of thin pizzas.  Ambiance is another matter.  There's both indoor and outdoor seating in this strip mall.  Like many such outdoor locales in Phoenix, this one adjoins a parking lot with a busy street across the way.  Since the weather was beautiful today, we decided to sit outdoors; especially as music was playing loudly inside.  Unfortunately, whether they can't or don't want to, the music cannot be shut off outside and it's not played softly.  To me, music is very subjective, just like art; and if you're listening to something you don't like, it doesn't enhance the meal, it ruins it.  Take a guess by my tone which category I fall into!\n\nFinally, I have to say, that I'm NOT a cheap person; I'm frugal.  A cheap person won't part with his/her money unless upon pain of death; a frugal person isn't loose with his/her money either, but has no problem paying for something when it's worth it.  I'm not arrogant or idiotic enough to believe that labor costs and convenience shouldn't be built into a price.  $7.49 + tax for a personal pizza on crispy loose leaf paper is not a bad deal.  But for $2.99, I can go to Safeway, get a thicker pizza, spend money on toppings and come out paying less and actually enjoy it ... as a snack.\n\nThere is nothing unreasonable about this place's prices or the concept.  I just don't see anything to brag or be excited about.  Add to that the occasional verbal assault by the homeless asking for money while you dine outside and the experience is more than forgettable ... I hope."
2599	1	a	The atmosphere is open and friendly. They use frozen pizza dough and yell your name once the pizza is done which is about 5 minutes. Besides that the pizza is tasty. The crust is cracker like but the toppings were full of flavor. Very similar to a chipotle but without naturally raised meats and organic locally grown produce. Good not great...

2601	0	a	I went here twice for work. The first time I had a thin crust pizza with goat cheese artichoke and balsamic dressing on it. My coworker had a pizza salad. The pizza dough did not have any flavor but the rest of the pizza tasted well. The line was long and the food came out quickly. My coworkers salad was fresh and crisp.
2602	0	a	Unfortunately, if I could give 0 stars I would.  We went to Treehouse for their grand opening on Friday and not much to report since the service was pretty terrible.  Granted it was their opening night, but they just seemed terribly unprepared.  It took almost half an hour before we got the beer that we ordered and another half an hour to get our salad.  The salad actually wasn't half bad, but that's all we ended up eating since after 1 hour and 20 minutes later, we were still waiting for our food.  We ended up following the lead of another table that decided to leave after only getting waters, waiting too long for their food.  We couldn't even get a grab of the waitress to pay for our salad and beer and ended up just giving cash to the hostess just so we could get out.\n\nIt's too bad, seemed like a fun concept, but don't plan on going back unless we hear that they fix those issues.
2603	1	a	The early reviewers should cut the staff some slack. I'd expect some glitches on opening day. \n\nI tried the half roasted chicken with corn succotash and apple slaw. Everything was delicious. I can see the patio becoming a very popular destination. My only complaint would be the weak mixed drinks at strong prices.
2604	1	a	We had a bday party there last night 18 of us.the platter of food we got was really good, the buffalo chicken egg rolls were not spicy or seasoned at all. The pork belly app is awesome.  The only complaint we had was the wine pours were very small, other than that we will be a regular there.
2605	0	a	Just what charlotte southpark needed, another chauvinist restaurant with young girls not pretty enough to strip in short shorts and mediocre food lol. The waitress hung over the top of the table while I ate with my husband and tried to flirt for her tips. Definitely not going back anytime soon.
2606	0	a	Swing and a miss\n\nI noticed the little signs saying 'Now Open' for about a week and was excited to try it out. Really was looking forward to a nice, unpretentious bar with good food near my house. \n\nFirst the restaurant is just weird looking. Definitely tree themed with a fake tree in the center of the dining room and a log motif on one wall but there is another space with an odd collage of manly movie stars; Brando, James Dean, Eastwood, Connery and then there is a strange bamboo ceiling piece over the bar. Just doesn't tie together well... \n\nThen the waitstaff, cute and little and all wearing denim overalls. Really? \n\nIt was pretty empty and I grabbed a seat at the bar. I was the ONLY person at the bar. Four televisions on and all tuned to the same Sunday Night Football game. I believe all the tv's were muted as music was playing. The place was also very cold - the door to the patio and the windows behind the bar were all open and was mid-50s. My bar stool was very wobbly so I switched to the next seat - looked like someone had pushed the back of the seat way back. Didn't help me at all - I tried to bend it back and that helped a bit. Regardless, the two seats I sat on should have been removed and fixed. \n\nAnyway I asked if they had any beer specials. Nope. So I order a beer, nice selection.\n\nThen I order the smoked chicken wing appetizer with blue cheese dressing and the large BBQ sample plate figuring I would take the leftovers home. Came with a side of coleslaw and one more side, I decided to try their sweet potato waffle fries.\n\nI tried to connect to their guest wifi. Website said ask your server for the password. Bartender doesn't know. Hostess and another waitress do not know. She comes back and asks me to try a password. No luck. Three minutes later some guy who had been outside smoking tells me to try another one. Not it. He tells me to capitalize the first character. Still nothing. He leaves. \n\nAfter about 10 minutes everything came out at once. Oy. Food looked all right, nothing too exciting. The pulled pork and the baby back ribs were less than room temperature. The smoked sausage was hot and the brisket was warm. Not a good sign. As far as I can tell the pulled pork was garbage - being cold didn't help but it was bland, needed salt and was very mushy. Tender is good, mushy is disgusting. The ribs were fine - tomato based sauce helped a bit but they were fine. Nothing to write home about but edible - probably been better had they been served warm. Brisket was good - on par with Mac's Speed Shop. Smoked sausage was also pretty tasty and the only hot food item I was served.\n\nAs for the sides - meh. The waffle cut sweet potato fries are hard to screw up and the coleslaw was unremarkable. The dinner was also served with a jalapeno cheddar biscuit, it too was cold and way to dry. Smelled much better than it tasted. Bartender waited until I was empty before offering another beer. I need the other beer to wash down the biscuit bite that was trying to kill me...\n\nAppetizer, dinner and two beers and tip came to $55 - if the place is still open three months from now I will assume they made substantial changes and will try them again but I am thinking this place will be shuttered before then.
2607	0	a	"Recommended by a friend for their \""good barbeque\"" and cool atmosphere. Tried it for lunch. Could be a generation gap but the waitress had purple hair and nose piercings. Immediately realized I was in the wrong place. Had the Korean taco as an appetizer. Tasty enough but mostly tortilla and not much filling. At $5.00 for a tortilla with less than an ounce of meat, some cilantro and a secret sauce it simply wasn't worth the price. BBQ sandwich was ok. Bun was nice and soft but the meat filled half the bun. Sweet potato fries came out cold and less than crisp. \n\nDidn't try the bar offerings since it was at lunch but heard the table next to us that did say the drinks were watered down and overpriced. The place just isn't special enough to earn a return visit. Too bad, a clever enough idea but at those prices they have to earn the business and quite simply, they didn't. Don't think this one will be around very long. The only way the make it is from the expense account crowd and there didn't appear to be enough of those business types in there to sustain it over time. Too many great options within a mile of the place."
2608	0	a	Stopped by early Tuesday evening.  Restaurant not very busy.  Chloe was our server, very friendly and bubbly.  I like the variety on the menu.  A good variety where most people can find something to eat.  I ordered the briscuit sandwich.  For $15 i expected a huge sandwich heaping with everything they described on the menu.  What I received was a small bun with maybe 4 oz of meat and two little ramekins of toppings.\nMy wife ordered 2 tacos.  The tacos tasted good but had very little filling in each one.  Again at $5/taco with no sides these are pricey.  We were both hungry after eating our food and ordered pecan pie.  The pie was good whole pieces of pecans on top but no pecans in the filling.  \nA 1/2 hour later after I left I was still hungry.  Not sure where the whiskey comes into play with the name.  They had an extensive beer list but I didn't see a similar whiskey list.  \n\nTreehouse might work as a place to go to after work for a drink but as a dinner destination there are better alternatives.
2609	0	a	Horrible food, horrible service, horrible management. Don't waste your time or money.
2610	1	a	Treehouse is brand new to the South Park area and every time I have dined there, the experience was amazing. The interior decor is beyond amazing, relaxing and luxurious yet it has a comfortable ambiance for families, business associates, and friends. The patio is the best in this area equipped with heaters to keep you comfortable during the cooler evenings. They have a wonderful variety of options for every type of diet and each plate is delicious. This place definitely should be deemed the best BBQ and Brisket restaurant in the entire Charlotte area. I've had the opportunity to try many entrees and appetizers, and so far my favorites are the Beer Can Cheese Dip (appetizer), Korean, Argentine, and Fish & Chip tacos, Lobster Cobb Salad and Fire Grilled Salmon Salad, Crab Legs and Dirty Shrimp, Out & In Burger and Classic Burger, Carolina Pull Pork BBQ and Beer Can Chicken Sandwich, and lastly any of there BBQ combination plates! \nThis place has every sauce you could think of to top off any and all menu selections and they are all made in house! Not to mention their incredibly friendly wait staff and over accommodating management team. \nDon't forget to try out there bar and large selections of draft beers and whisky!
2611	0	a	Was hoping for a low key bar in Southpark....unfortunately I probably won't return. The bar tender was so rude and thought she was the coolest thing ever. Terrible martini, she was drinking her own drink on the bar out of a straw and was on her phone ..the worst part, the girls behind the bar kept flinging their hair everywhere and running their fingers through it and then making drinks without washing their hands. Bartender said she works uptown at Suite on the weekends - her behavior and long hair may work there but not for us.  We weren't given an itemized receipt so have no idea how much each of our drinks were however we were asked to start a tab with credit card ( I guess two folks in professional clothing are a flight risk at a Southpark bar at 5pm??)\nThey allowed someone to smoke a cigar on the patio that drifted smoke into the place.\nThe manager seemed to like flirting with the bartenders more than caring about getting patrons service. \nMusic was really loud for 5 pm on a Thursday.  \nDidn't even try the food because we were so turned off by the bartenders we left.\nPretty sure the 5 star review prior to mine was done by  a server who works there....
2612	0	a	Was really excited to try this place out. The decor was adorable and the service was pretty good, but found their food to be just okay. I tried two different tacos, one was okay, but the jerk chicken was awful. I even asked the waitress if it was in fact jerk chicken and she said it was and I told her I didn't like it at all. I didn't even it and mind you one taco with nothing else is $5. She didn't take it off the bill, which shows me they aren't interested in customer service.
2613	0	a	Just bad all around. The waitress we had was as sweet as could be but that doesn't make up for the less-than-stellar food. All four of us got sick after eating there. I don't think I'll be going back for a second try.
2614	0	a	I have to say I was a little skeptical of this place, the reviews are bad and I called for call ahead seating and the hostess wasn't the friendliest or the brightest. However, with much hesitation, I gave it a try. I was excited to try a new place. First the hostess didn't even acknowledge I was there, I had to say excuse me (I know she saw me there). It is a tiny place, or maybe cozy is a better word. Our server was attentive right away and through out the meal. The food however...mediocre. The alcohol selection definitely trumps the food selection. I had the beer can chicken sandwich with mac-n-cheese as my side. The side was so small, think I finished it in 2 bites, and it was just warm, needed to be hotter, the chicken was OK...it wasn't dry, but not overly flavorful either. It needs something on the sandwich like BBQ sauce or mayo, something was missing. My friend  had the French onion soup and a wedge salad. The salad was huge, and she said the French onion soup was bland, a lot of salt needed to be added...it's hard to mess up soup. I think some of the food is over priced too for the portions and the taste. This isn't a great place but not a terrible place either. My favorite part was they have NoDa's Jam Session, it's on of my favorite local beers. I think this place has potential, but unfortunately it will take longer to get there than it should....you have to remember it is in the South Park area, people expect more.
2615	0	a	"Well, I went back 2-3 times since the Grand Opening. All on Wednesdays because Simplified was playing! That's the ONLY reason I'd go there. I spoke with a manager the 2nd time I went there and he told me he personally would put Corona on the beer order! Still don't have it. I'd have to agree that the female bartenders are not very friendly, ever! No smiles, no \""how are you\"", etc... Nothing! And that is each time I've been back! Two weeks ago I ordered a burger. It was ok. Fries are not very good. Last week I ordered a triple grilled cheese. It literally was THE smallest sandwich I've ever had. Two small bites and the 1/2 was gone! Way too little food for their prices! Add that with a bar staff that isn't friendly and you have a recipe for failure! If it wasn't for Simplified playing, I would not go back!"
2616	0	a	"We won't be back anytime soon.  First, the hostess \""warned\"" us that a band would be playing soon and it would be loud.  Anyway, we opted to sit and the music being played (not the band) was so loud that we couldn't really talk.  We waited 15 minutes for a waitress to come by to take our drink order without any apology for the wait.  No big deal but we were close to walking out which now I wish we did.  \n\nWe ordered a glass of wine and a beer and I tried to order an appetizer but she walked away while I was ordering it.  Anyway. when she came back and we ordered the buffalo shrimp,  a Korean taco and the beer can chicken sandwich with sweet potato fries.  The buffalo shrimp came out about 5 minutes later and they were very good.   The rest of the meal came out about 10 minutes later and it went down hill for there.  The Korean taco tasted like sweet, pur\u00e9ed beef.  Not appetizing.  My husband wouldn't eat it after one bite and I am not sure I have ever seen him not eat more than one bite of a dish.  The beer can chicken sandwich was fine if unremarkable.  Even though I ordered sweet potato waffle fries we received regular fries (again it was loud in there and hard to hear.). The fries were very good.\n\nMy husband ordered another beer and she took away the first one when he ordered it when it had about 3 sips left in his original beer. \n\nShe offered us dessert but we just wanted to get out of there at that point so I handed her my credit card.  I checked the bill after we left and they didn't discount my wine for Wednesday \""1/2 price wine night\"" but that was my fault for not checking it before I paid it.\n\nWe LOVE Baku and we we were more than disappointed that this restaurant was so bad.  It's a great location and a cute space but the service and food were subpar at best."
2617	0	a	"South Park still desperate for a decent casual restaurant other than chain Cheesecake Factory which is not a bad fallback fortunately.  This place trying hard to find itself with a wait staff young and honing their skills.  I'd guess ownership is completely male hiring mostly female bartenders and wait staff. Are they catering to 25 year old men or families? In addition to our waitress, at least 2 male manager types walk by and ask how things were - surprised we weren't asked to fill a 5 page survey. Menu has a Mexican restaurant feel - inexpensive food at average prices. One appetizer was described as fried oysters and consisted of 5 to 6 small 1/2\"" clam sized oysters in their shell for $15.00 - what!!?.  One of their wrap tacos had a entire 3/4\"" slice of lime buried in it - as I bit down to chew I was chewing the skin of a lime - seriously? Clearly somebody in the kitchen doesn't G.A.S. Next!"
2618	0	a	This place has a managerial problems,bartender problems, and pricing problems. Don't go.
2619	0	a	I doubt if I will return. My wife and I got the BBQ combo plate with pulled pork, brisket, beer can chicken, and ribs. The brisket tasted like pot roast and the pulled pork kinda tasted like the brisket. The ribs were okay, but there are so many other places that have far better ribs. The chicken was above average, but nothing worth returning for \n\nFor an app we got the smoked wings.  Decent flavor, but fatty. How can wings be fatty?\n\nThe service was mediocre. The server was nice, but her knowledge of the menu was limited. I asked her a question and she had to take the menu from me and look at the description. \n\nThe concept is too cute. Little Branches=Appetizers. Too cute. \n\nThe only good thing was the nice selection of bourbon.
2620	0	a	BBQ chicken was so dry it was almost inedible.  Clearly it had been sitting around warming for some time.  The drinks were so watered down it was impossible to taste the liquor.  I really wanted to like this place but there was nothing to like.  Just plain bad.
2621	0	a	"Beware is all I can say. The tree house is one of those niche places with \""witty\"" menu items like \""sticks\"" instead of sides. The salad and soups are \""leaves and sap\"" you get the point. Prices are way to high...bone in rib eye for $39!!!! It's a small interior with 10 bar stools. This place will be gone by summer 2015"
2622	0	a	Interesting decor, waitress was obviously new to the job, but well meaning. We ate lunch, both had the French onion soup. Large pieces of bread, no broth aside from the soggy bread, onions and cheese were OK, but overall not a pleasant soup. Deb had a pulled pork taco she liked, I had a grilled cheese sandwich with roasted peppers. The sandwich was good, but perhaps less goat cheese and more of the other two cheeses would have been better. After reading other reviews about the minuscule wine portions, we had iced tea and lemonade. In spite my request for light ice, my glass was 70% ice, which really irks me. Bottom line, we are in no hurry to return, nothing stands out and with the number of excellent restaurants in the area, I think it will be tough going for this place.
2623	0	a	Great atmosphere - decor is thematic without being too kitschy. Looking forward to weather being nice again to sit on what looks like a good patio. Unfortunately, that was the best part of the evening. Tables are set close together, and noise level was high (bouncy acoustics). Food was only so-so - we had 7 different entrees around the table, all of which needed more seasoning. Strange that none of the pulled barbecue had sauce in a town and state that pride themselves on different styles and house secret/special condiments. Mixed drinks were very weak (sad for a whiskey joint), beer selection was okay. Starter salads were good size and looked very fresh. Service was casual but fairly attentive. We may be back to try the patio in spring - hope they will have found their style and settled into a groove by then!
2624	0	a	What a crock. First I got stuck in traffic and was 10 min late after calling. Not willing to work with me at all. So by time my massage started it was 15 min after my original start time. So I got a 45 min massage that was just ok.  I get a massage about every 6 weeks and this was nothing to rave about at all. Then afterwards when I went to pay, I swear I booked a $60 hour massage and when I went to check out it was $75. So I just paid $75 for a mediocre 45 min massage. I am so upset. I feel like I was taken advantage of. Plus I had a $55 coupon that I was given at my yoga place but unfortunately I forgot it. They wouldn't take my word for it or work with me. I would NOT suggest anyone bother going here. I left in tears I was so upset. There are so many other better places to go.
2625	1	a	Great subs great service!!  Full of meat, nice and clean quick service. Definitely will go back for more.
2626	0	a	This place was the dirtiest restaurant I have even eaten in!  \n\nMy wife told me how good firehouse subs were so while going to California she wanted to eat here.  We went in and were greeted fast and no one was in line on a Sunday at dinner time (should have been my first clue!)  We ordered our sandwiches and went to get the fountain drinks.  The floor was filthy and had multiple layers of spills on it.  The counter in the drink area also was dirty and had several old spills and trash on it.  \n\nI went to try the drink machine and could see lemons or limes inside the drain and other trash in it.  The drink machine needed a wiping down and it also had spills all over it.  \n\nWe were able to find a table that didn't need too much wiping down so we could eat.  This place was slow and only had one other table with dine-in customers.  \n\nI counted 9 employees working and they were not busy.  I can not believe the management or health department could let this place stay open with it being this dirty. \n\nThe food was not that good either!
2627	1	a	Stopped by traveling from Los Angeles to Phoenix.  Great place.  Subs were the best.  The subs were freshly made and served warm.  Prices were very affordable.  The location was super clean everywhere.  I would recommend it highly.  I would definitely come back.
2628	1	a	There's nothing better than going shopping and being treated like first class, if I'm going to spend my hard-earned money on something, I like to be well-informed about the product and why it would benefit me. The sales associate was very knowledgeable and friendly, the shop was clean and cute, and in my favorite part of chandler. They had quality shoes, great prices, lots of my favorite brand names and best of all, my size!
2629	0	a	We've ordered from Geno's several times now and for the prices you pay it's decent pizza for the price. I like the seasoned crust. My favorite choice here is The Italian -  pepperoni, ham, salami and pepperoncinis. \n\nAlso, try ordering a Geno's large pizza and throw some bacon on it (for you carnivores out there). \n\nWings are decent - not the best I've ever had, but not bad. I like the hot and hot bbq the best. Wife likes the garlic parmesan wings. \n\nNext time around I will probably try one if their toasted subs. The Italian and Steak & Cheese sound pretty good. \n\nWhen you call in an order, a lot of times they will give you the coupon discount or tell you about the monthly special, even if you don't know about them. \n\nI had to downgrade my rating for Geno's since I wrote my first review because of two experiences that I had picking up orders. On one trip to get our pizza we found that it had apparently been sitting there for quite some time - much earlier than we were told, so basically we had slightly warmed pizza. Last week it happened again, except this time I walked in to pickup at the time they indicated it would be ready and was told our pizzas should ready in another 5-10 more minutes. After waiting 15, I asked someone, figuring our order might have been lost. What they discovered was that our order had been ready all along on the waiting rack and they missed it. So once again slightly warmed pizza. \n\nIt seems that other customers here share similar experiences with orders that are not ready at the pickup time provided. C'mon Geno's - you need to get your act together...
2630	0	a	"I have never been inspired to write a review on my eating experience as much as my first encounter with Geno's. I had also had to write this review, again, considering it somehow disappeared and how disappointed I was in myself for having fed my family this quality of food...really upset.   Earlier this week we decided to order Geno's after having received a flyer in the mail.   Considering all the Pizza competition in this tiny San Tan Valley radius, we were extremely disappointed with the quality of food we received.  We are realistic people and understand what to expect when getting \""budget\"" friendly pizza options.  However, when we initially placed the order via phone, we were told it would he about a 45-60 minute wait.  We figured that that since they were this busy that their food must really be good. However, we were really hungry.  It was the middle of the week, it was late evening,  and we had just gotten home from work.  We decided to call back and requested if they could have our order ready for pickup.   They said it would be ready in 15 minutes.  Happy with this option I jumped in the car within 10 minutes and got there within another 5.  When I arrived, they couldn't find my order.  I repeated to them my address,  my name, my phone number several times.  At this point I was thinking they forgot my order.  It 5 minutes for them to find it and it had been sitting on a large rack with other orders.  I don't recall if there heat lamps or not.  When I got home, the pizza and wings were cold.  Not even slightly warm.  The pizza was poorly put together and looked and tasted like whoever had put it together didn't care about taste or at least have minimum standards of quality.  We have ordered budget friendly pizza options from all the other local pizza places and not once have we ever received cold pizza and wings and that was with delivery which usually takes longer.   We have realistic expectations on what to expect with certain food options but this was NOT worthy of our money.  We won't be giving Geno's a second chance.  At the time i wrote my review, there were a alot of negative reviews (which disappeared from yelp somehow) and the owners hadn't respond once to any comments on lack of decent quality.  To me this shows that they don't care about the customer and I will  spend my money elsewhere moving forward."
2631	0	a	Pizza always takes over an hour, but tonight it took nearly two. We called to check on our order, and were put on hold - twice. When the pizza finally arrived, it was cold.\n\nWe love that they have a gluten-free option (even though it's TINY and $10), we love that they have $5 pizzas, AND we love that they deliver! \n\nHowever, waiting nearly 2 hours for cold pizza with not even an apology is not something I'm interested in doing again.\n\nI hate giving negative reviews to new businesses, because I really try to like them, but sometimes it's necessary. Something big has to change, or Geno's won't stay in business very long.
2632	0	a	Greasy greasy! Flavored crust was not flavored. Garlic and herb but looked like they just sprinkled garlic powder on it. Couldn't really taste a difference. Won't be coming back.
2633	0	a	This Geno's location is absolutely terrible. It takes two hours for a pizza  (even when they tell you it will only be one hour). They mess up orders and deliver the wrong food and when you call back to let them know that it's wrong the management staff doesn't care. Their pizza has been excessively greasy and no flavored crust. The ladies answering the phones blame the customers for wrong orders and argue about the delivery time. Worst Geno's in the valley!
2634	0	a	I went there tonight for the first time and I will NEVER go back. It was the greasiest, grossest pizza I have ever had. The crust was soggy and the pizza was dripping in grease. I guess 5 bucks means 5 yucks!! Plus, the place was so noisy with them banging the dough to death at the kitchen. STAY AWAY! Get a cheap crap pizza at Papa Johns instead.
2635	0	a	Geno's has been to our home at least 10 times and is usually good considering the price. Tonight after waiting over an hour and calling back they said they couldn't find out house. Not only that but it wasn't on the GPS they said and our home has been here since 2008. Our # is 7482 and the driver said he only could find 7487? Not to mention there's a light over the house # on the garage and on the porch. Manager was willing to deliver cold pizza but not remake them. We cancelled the order and doubt we call again. YOU SUCK.
2636	1	a	Geno's is one of my family's safety nets! Whenever we run out of time they are one of our top three options of eating out. The food is good, inexpensive and as long as it is not a weekend prepared rather quickly! So if you're looking for quality pizza and don't want to spend a lot check them out.
2637	1	a	This shop screams cute..... cute cute cute. It's like a bakery on a movie set, I kid you not. I walked by the shop after lunch and, despite being totally full, I just couldn't not go in... the vintage -y decor and neatly displayed pastries called out to me.... I was doomed. The people who work here are very nice, helpful, and friendly. Their recipes are mostly Italian based, which makes them a little different than other local bakeries. After much deliberation (and I mean MUCH.... like extensive), I tried the brownie and the cheesecake. The brownie looked kind of dry on the outside, but don't let that fool you, it was somewhere between a cake texture and a fudgy brownie texture, certainly not dry. The brownie was chocolatey but not overly rich with chocolate chips throughout. Was it my favorite brownie in town? No (I am partial to a fudgy more chocolatey and rich brownie). But it was very good and if I were in the neighborhood I would get it again. The cheesecake, on the other hand, was fairly awesome. This was no New York cheesecake. It was surprisingly light and airy, not the heavy oh-my-god-I'm-so-full-need-bigger-pants kind of cheesecake you get most places (not that I don't like that too, this was just something you may want to eat with more frequency). It was sweet without being overly sweet and they didn't complicate it with toppings or flavors, it was just a good plain cheesecake. Oh, and it isn't served in slices, it's served like a cupcake.... so cute. Anyway, each dessert cost 3$, so the prices are competitive with other local bakeries. Definitely check this cute little bakery out next time you're in the area.\n\nPS they have cupcakes and the flavors change depending on the baker's mood each day.... how cute is that?\n\nPPS Can I say cute one more time? Whoa.
2638	0	a	"The atmosphere is nice but steer clear of the food and drinks. My friend ordered a mojito and the basil in the mojito was brown and wilting! As a \""bartender\"" how do you serve something like this to your customers?? Do you not even look at the product that you are making for someone? It gets better (or worse!) The queso dip with chorizo was horrible. The chips were stale tasting with tons of seasoning on them. The queso tasted like cardboard and the chorizo-um three little chunks of chorizo?! I hardly call that queso AND chorizo dip. Tacos were on special that night and I was highly unimpressed with them. I could make a dozen tacos at home with a higher quality of ingredients for the cost that I spent on two tacos here. Service was sparse and somewhat scattered."
2639	1	a	I'll start by saying I'm a huge fan of authentic Mexican cuisine. El toro loco and Emeliano's are my go to in the Southside. Me and my buddy went for happy hour where they have some decent drink specials and solid food specials. We both ordered the three amigos chips/ salsa and queso. The three amigos is 3 tacos 3 different kinds of meat, your choice of corn of flour tort and two kinds of toppings. Wow, they were phenomenal. Our bills came to $6.02 after splitting the bill. I would of gave 5 starts but they charge for chips and salsa.
2640	0	a	nope. the restaurant looked nice, but felt dirty.  we watched the hostess pick few pieces of food off of the table with her fingers (gross), but never wiped it off. the food was not so great. the guac was clearly not fresh...it was bland and tasted like pre-packaged goo. the margarita was ok, but relatively flavorless for 9$. salsa was definitely not housemade. you get the idea. cool atmosphere, but we won't be back.
2641	0	a	Food was mediocre; edible but lacked flavor.  Wait staff was ok. Atmosphere was great!
2642	0	a	Been to the one in Shadyside a few times and always had a good experience. The one in the south side still doesn't have it together. Service was awful. Took 20+ minutes to get our first round of drinks. Our server took our order after we were sitting there for 30 minutes. Our food came out, but we didn't have silverware. Server came over 10 minutes later and finally addressed the issue. By the time we had everything we needed to eat, the food was cold. It wasn't even a packed house, so the excuse that they were really busy isn't applicable. The manager still tries to use the excuse 'we just opened and are still working on things'. It's a restaurant chain that's been open for weeks now. They should have things rolling smoothly by now if they new what they were doing. Won't be going back and would not recommend.
2643	0	a	This place sucks! Literally the worst food I've paid for in the 26 years I've been on this earth. Skip this place - anywhere is better. Trust me.
2644	0	a	We only came here because La Palapa was full with a 45 minute wait, we were starving, this was across the street, and they could seat us immediately. Sad disappointment. Next time I'll get takeout from La Palapa, or make a reservation there. \n\nTo be fair, the chipotle salsa was okay, but the chips were extra tough, and the pile was about four times too large for the amount of salsa.\n\nWe tried the beet tacos (interesting, but not amazing), and the fish tacos (downright bad). The rice and beans included as side dishes weren't great either. I think this place mainly caters to the college drinking crowd, but I wouldn't go here for the food. The bathroom was also completely out of soap which is a little gross.
2645	0	a	This place is just a Mad Mex clone, and Mad Mex kinda sucks. I popped into this location for a quick lunch. The food was mediocre. It took way too long for me to get service even though there were very few people there. \n\nThis place is supposed to be mexican, I guess. They don't have Mezcal, though. I've been to local dive bars who have better tequila selection. Steel Cactus is a half-baked concept. The only positive is that the space looks pretty cool. Staff was fine.

2648	1	a	Awesome new restaurant. Decor and atmosphere was impressive. Albacore Tataki appetizer was excellent. They also had Mango Boba Cocktail which was good. Yaki Udon was on point. Tried the Eight Roll, Miami Roll, Firecracker Roll, Sashimi Roll, and Sea to Shore Roll. All were tasty. Did I mention they also make their own sriracha?! Eight is Great!
2649	1	a	Took my turn at visiting this new place just last weekend and was impressed.  The staff was very knowledgeable and friendly regarding the menu options as well as being attentive but not overly so as to annoy.\n\nI chose a couple non rice/low carb options and while I've tried these types of rolls at other places, Eight really got it right.  \n\nThis is the old Bask place but they have really transformed it via some very unique artwork by a local artist and given it a very trendy vibe.
2650	1	a	Food was excellent. It is good for casual sushi but service could be more professional.
2651	1	a	Finally another great sushi place in Charlotte!\n\nI am always hesitant about sushi restaurants, they are either really good, or really, really bad. Eight has a funky laid back vibe and feels very welcoming. Some of the great artwork by local artists, ahem..Matt Hooker & Matt Moore, gives this place a vibrant feel. \nI was a bit disappointed they don't serve hot sake, but was quickly turned on to the cold sake served in shot glass inside a box which fills with the pour over from the glass. The server told me the overflow was a representation of of happiness and good luck. Quite charming I might say.  \nThe food was on point, we ordered several rolls and one beef skewer. I was impressed with everything we had. They have a lot to choose from and it was hard to make a decision. The Godzilla Wrath roll was probably one of my favorites, it's super spicy (in a good way) so if you're not a fan of the heat, I'd steer clear. \nI highly recommend this place and will definitely be returning to try some more items.
2652	0	a	"Wish I could review the food. They never brought my dish to me. They told me that the chef \""missed it\"". I had reservations at the Comedy Zone, so I couldn't wait another hour for them to bring me anything. I guess I could ask the other people at my table how they enjoyed their food. Not impressed."
2653	0	a	"Eight probably has some of the best interior design I've seen in Charlotte. Unfortunately, their food quality and service fall to the other side of the spectrum. The Ramen noodles were served in a custom kitchen broth that tasted more like a bad gravy. The Korean beef skewers were mediocre, cold, and I couldn't help but think of the old lady on the old Wendy's commercial - (\""Where's the beef!\"")The summer rolls were pretty good. The best thing I had was probably the papaya salad, but there simply wasn't enough of it. A friend of mine at the table gave me two of his dumplings because he knew I was still very hungry after all of my appetizer samples. The dumplings were ok. I didn't get my drink until after my food starting coming out and had to ask for a refill. Overall, the experience was so poor that I'm not sure I would be willing to go back, and spend my money on small portions of food. The lack of quality, plate size, and overpriced food were just too many disappointing factors to allow me to give this place another chance. To make matters worse, my friend seated across from me, waited an hour and a half to never receive his food. He literally left the restaurant without one bite of food. I think it's safe to say that the manager knew full well that several of us at the table had a bad restaurant experience. I'm really surprised he didn't make an effort to smooth things over for PR purposes by visiting our table and offering an apology. I wish this restaurant the best of luck but like so many things at the nc music factory over the years, this restaurant might go the way of the dodo..."
2654	1	a	Finally checked this place out! The decor is really cool. I was surprised that the place was empty when we went for dinner, but hey that means less waiting for us! We took advantage of their buy 1 get 1 roll free special, which is a really good deal. They also have happy hour specials, so make sure to check those out on their website.\n\nThe complimentary edamame hummus and shrimp chips were delicious and something new. I've never had edamame hummus before! I'm no sushi expert, but I thought the food was good, no complaints.\n\nAs far as service, I think there could be room for improvement. Our server seemed a bit bothered when we asked questions and didn't really seem like he wanted to be there. We were the only table he was taking care of, I'm sure he could have put in a little more effort. We were curious about the sake box shots, but he didn't really do a good job explaining what it was... just sake shots in a box? A table next to us got those shots and their waiter made it seem interesting and I read a review here that there's a story behind the box shots. If our waiter explained them, I'm pretty sure we would have ordered a round or 2.\n\nWill be back when I'm craving sushi again!
2655	0	a	"I really wanted to love this place because if anyone has read any of my reviews I love sushi and seafood in general so a new Sushi spot is something I always welcome...\n\nThat being said I cant give my personal thumbs up to Eight.\n\nWe decided to try this place out last Friday at my urging because the reviews I saw were pretty good. We arrived at about 8pm and though there were people the place wasn't very crowded at all.  As other reviewers have stated the d\u00e9cor in the inside is quite nice.  We asked if we could sit at the bar since no one was at the entire bar and the tables they had free were very low for my tall companion.  \n\nWe sat a the bar and waited for 10 minutes before we asked could we put our order in.  Did I mention NO ONE was at the bar.  We put in a simple order bottle of Sake, order of  egg rolls to share, 2 orders of miso soup, and 2 orders of dancing eel roll.\n\nWaiter poured and spilled some of the Sake.  20mins later our eggrolls came out... bland and not that tasty though they were hot. Another 15 mins went by and we had to ask about our soup.  10 minutes later One bowl of soup arrived??  When we inquired about the second bowl of soup we got an apology from the waiter that he was confused.  When we placed our order I ordered my soup and roll first.  When the waiter went to my partner he said \""I want the same thing, soup and the same roll\""....so not sure how that could be confused... But hey no harm no foul.  The Second bowl of soup comes out 15 minutes later.  No tofu, no seaweed, just  2 slivers of mushroom and water??  We sent that bowl of soup back. Another 15 minutes go by with no roll.  We ask again and are told its coming.. 5 minutes later ONE roll arrives.  The waiter never corrected his mistake.  After a lot of apologizing...we just asked for the check.  The roll was gross, chewy, small, with ONE piece of eel on the entire roll.  By that time too much time had passed to find another sit down restaurant-mainly because my partner had to work in the AM and it was much too late. He was forced to eat a turkey sandwich when we got home so he wouldn't starve .\n\nThe one star I give is to the manager on duty that night.  He was apologetic and over all very nice..however we will not return for a do over."
2656	0	a	Sorry all...but let me get to business. We were so excited for BBQ and it's at Town Sq....score!!!\nWalked to a gorgeous space where everyone was all smiles and friendly. We sat at the bar...bartender was super nice too.\nOk food! Menu is ok....missing things like BBQ sandwiches and French fries but since we didn't bring the kids it was fine (that's what they like as for BBQ). My husband and I split the platter that has brisket, half chicken(opted for the all white meat) and pulled pork. It came with 2 sides he chose collard green and Mac and cheese...we also added corn bread and a side of hot links.\nFood came out promptly it was Luke warm at best and most of the meats were dried...we sent it back and they warmed it up. Mac and cheese was ok and the greens had no flavor...corn bread was the best part of my meal.\nThey have 4 BBQ sauces none of them very good at all....also there was no bbq smoke flavor...they said they smoke their meats low and slow...but by the dried out grill marks from the chicken...I don't think so.\nSorry we won't be back....very disappointed.
2657	1	a	Awesome atmosphere, hand painted wall art, saxophone chandeliers and great service! Had the burnt end sliders and a Great Basin Brewery Milk Stout which was awesome, being from Reno I appreciated the Nevada flavor. Will be back very soon for some dinner.
2658	1	a	We decided to try Pot Liquor CAS after seeing a tweet sent out by Brian T from Marquee. He was so thrilled, I wanted to see for myself.\n\nPot Liquor CAS is located just down the way from Yard House and right next to valet at Town Square. There wasn't a wait and we were greeted and seated immediately.\n\nThe decor is really cool, upscale casual type vibe. Cloth napkins on the lovely dark wood tables.\n\nWe had two back servers greet us at our table, one with a glass bottle of water. Our main server was Kristen B. and she was a complete delight! Very bubbly and energetic with a cute accent.\n\nWe ordered the Beef with the Chicken and the Hog, sides of corn muffins (for me) and french fries with White Sauce (for the husband).\n\nThe wait was about 20 minutes or so for our food but once that platter of deliciousness was brought to us, the wait didn't matter.\n\nCorn muffins were yummy with a warm honey butter served on the side. French fries had a good seasoning on them and went well with the white sauce.\n\nThe brisket was incredible! So tender and juicy! I wished there had been more on our platter!\n\nThe chicken had a great sear, juicy and flavorful. And what a nice surprise to have the chicken served as an airline breast! (Boneless breast with drumette bone attached) When does one ever see that in a barbecue place?\n\nAnd then there was the pork. The Carolina Pulled Pork. WOW!! The smoke flavor in that pork was just amazing!! I want to go back for lunch just to have that pork in a sandwich.\n\nOur platter came with a few sauces, Cue #2 which had a great kick, the vinegar based one which I loved and the white, mayo based sauce.\n\nI personally liked the kick of 'cue #2 mixed with the vinegar base of the other :)\n\nWe enjoyed our meal and will return again. \n\nThanks to GM John for coming over and introducing himself. Welcome to the neighborhood, Pot Liquor CAS.
2659	1	a	Best BBQ spot in LV. Carl, the server was fantastic!  Christian at the bar was great. Can't say enough about the food and service.
2660	1	a	Love this place!!  All the food is amazing!!  The service is great and they have  really good drinks!!
2661	0	a	Went here for lunch on Wednesday September 24th, restaurant maybe half full at best.\n\nAt first impression I like the decor, the simplistic look, the colors all in all looks nice, but then you sit down and realize that the furniture is garbage, the chairs are way to small and hard and the tables are to low for even average people.\n\nThe menu looks good but way overpriced, somewhat to expect for Townsquare but this is bad, however the orders were made for lunch, some sandwiches a burger etc.\n\n40 minutes later the food comes out and now really makes the point that this is a disaster, now the food is not bad let's make that clear but average at best, combine that with the horrible seating and poor service my conclusion is don't even bother.\n\nThis is a rare bad review from me in a town with a ton of dining offered, but the experience is so bad that I felt I had to do this.
2662	1	a	Unfortunately, I was not able to try everything on the menu in one sitting!  However, the rubbed ribs, collard greens, and succotash was delicious.  I grew up in the South and know something about greens and BBQ.  I'll tell you that the food at Pot Liquor is delicious.  The staff is very attentive, My server, Leia is an absolute gem.  Friendly, attentive, and there when you need her.  The BBQ sauces are amazing; hot Texas style, Memphis sweet, Carolina Vinegar, and Alabama white are too good to describe.  \n\nI can't sing the praises of this place enough, so I will have to go back on my next trip the LV and try some more of their delectable fare.  \nr
2663	1	a	One of my close friends Antonio had his 18th birthday party here and everything was absolutely perfect! The BBQ, the salad, the Mac and cheese, chicken! I was in heaven. The customer service was rapid quick and super friendly! Might start being the best restaurant in town square !!!
2664	0	a	"Pros = Nice looking place, decor is pleasant.  Also, we got a nice discount from the manager after our experience (see below.) \n\nCons = Just about everything else.  Our server was nice, but her service was slow.  The food took over an hour (not exaggerating) to get to us, and the food (that was actually what we ordered... Some was messed up) was over-cooked.  Also, for a BBQ place, they seem to have some sort of issue with barbecue sauces.\nRibs, Brisket, and sandwiches were ordered, and everyone got one half-filled ramekin of BBQ sauce each, that's it.  The Mac and cheese was good, although a little bland.  The collard greens were OK, but nothing any home cook couldn't do better with.\nGoing back to the lack of sauce for a minute, when asked for more sauce, they brought out a plate with 3 more half-filled ramekins on it, explaining they were the \""Q1, Q2, and Q3 sauces.\""  when asked what that meant, we were told they are three different sauces... Great, thanks! \n\nIf you live in Vegas, you already know to go to Lucille's or Rollin' Smoke for your BBQ.  Let the tourists deal with this place."
2665	0	a	Not what I would call good or fair BBQ, edible maybe. Had the Carolina pulled pork for lunch, not even close to real Carolina pulled pork. Having spent 7 years working back and forth in the Carolina's, I've had my share of pulled pork. No flavor to the meat, slaw served on the side and vinegar on side does not count as Carolina BBQ sauce. Prices are very high, yes they do offer bottled still or sparking water for free (thus 2 stars vs 1), but nearly $4 for a fountain drink?  Pass on this place till they figure their prices and recipes out. Feel bad saying this, but better food and value at a chain like Famous Daves or Lucilles in the area right now.
2666	0	a	$3.95 for a soda?  I should have known right there they weren't interested in locals (yes, I'm familiar with the prices at other local restaurants this is, after all, my neighborhood).  My brisket sandwich had so much fat that I gave up and took the rest home for the dog.  Too bad, because I was looking forward to having a high quality BBQ restaurant, nearby.  I will watch to see if there are any substantial changes in their approach, before returning.
2667	1	a	Who knew barbecue could be so refined? Pot Liquor just opened up in Town Square and we are so happy to have it.  I immediately noticed the pork belly with country grits, and even though I'm usually not a fan of grits we decided to run with it.  This paid off, just order it. Seriously, just do it.  They were creamy and cheesy, and had the comforting nostalgia of mac and cheese.  This was a big deal for me because I need to stay away from gluten, and this is gluten free.  There are little GF circles all over the menu so anyone with this allergy shouldn't feel left out.  I didn't even get to the pork belly itself yet.  It was almost caramelized, nicely seared on the outside, while being rich, juicy, and tender on the inside. Most places I've been to, the pork belly is usually crunchy or chewy (sometimes overly), but this was neither. It was on another level, it melted in your mouth almost like you'd expect foie gras to. I'm gonna say this again, it was almost like pork foie gras. \n\nI got the Worcestershire braised short ribs.  The presentation kind of blew my mind, it was on par with the high end dining I've seen in Scottsdale or Cave Creek AZ.  This flavor was balanced, Worcestershire can be overpowering or it's used so sparingly you'd be oblivious to the fact you're consuming it if it wasn't listed.  The initial kick hits and tapers nicely.  The meat is falling apart as you pick it up with your fork, and again, the flavors are overall warm and comforting.  \n\nService was great, the food took a while to come out.  It's still worth it but it's hard to make within a lunch hour.  I also understand this place just opened and we think the kitchen might have been shot staffed.  We were there the day before the official grand opening.  I think this place has the potential for 4 stars once they work some of the kinks out.
2668	0	a	"So.... everyone seemed to have good things to say about this place, I might be the only odd one out. We went there on a Friday around lunchtime and the place only had couple tables to start. We were greeted by the hostess and we asked to see the menu first before deciding whether to eat here or not. The menu looked very appealing so we got a table. \n\nThe decoration inside was clean, appealing and very nice. Our server was very friendly and prompt. So why did I give this a 1 star?\n\nWe ordered off the lunch menu. DH got the T.L.B \""Tender Loving Bacon\"" (10.95) and I got the Shrimp Po' Boy (13.95). And we ordered the appetizer Pork Belly With Country Grits (9.95).  (See the pictures I posted)\n\nThe App came out in a decent amount of time, it was only 2 pieces of pork belly on top of some grits, the presentation is nice and the flavors were ok. But come on, it is not worth $9.95 price tag. Before we were done with our app the entrees came out. DH's T.L.B is a joke, size wise, it's like 4 bites and with 2 pieces of bacon and they call it a BLT and charge $10.95 for it?? It probably only cost them $2 at the most to make this at this portion. \n\nMy Po' Boy was decently sized, I got few pieces of large shrimp in mine. The flavor however is lacking. No seasoning whatsoever and the shrimp had a heavy shrimp smell to it (it wasn't very fresh). Both dishes came with a side of cole slaw and fries. The cole slaw did not have flavor, only a touch of vinegar. We both only ate one bite of it and that's it. The fries were good, crunchy and fresh out of the fryer.\n\nOverall, the food just did not live up to the description on the menu and it's way too overpriced. I know this location must have a high overhead but you cannot charge $10.95 for a kid's sized sandwich."
2669	0	a	I was so excited to try this after reading all the positive reviews.  This place was a let down. I had to double check to see if some Yelp event was hosted here first to ensure the great reviews. It doesn't look that way. This place just missed the mark. Maybe because they are only 5 weeks old? \n\nPROS: Fried Green Tomato salad - prosciutto, goat cheese and red onion. \n            Meat falls off the bone.\n\nCONS: Ribs were served below warm \n            Mopped ribs (means sauced) needed lots more sauce\n            Lemon meringue marshmallow topping on yams\n            \nWe left and knew we probably won't be back.  It's rare, but sometimes the ratings and me don't mix.
2670	0	a	I had the brisket and my husband had the pulled pork.  Our meat was full of fat so we went our dishes back and the revised brisket was then dry and the pulled pork looked more like burnt ends.  And, to top it off, about two hours later, we were both very sick.  We only had eaten here so can't blame it on anywhere else and no, it wasn't a stomach bug.  I want to enjoy and recommend new places but I just have nothing that I can positively say about this place. I've had much better BBQ at other places and did not end up sick.
2671	0	a	So we came here cause we heard good things from friends. We were excited that it was happy hour so 25% off menu items. Needless to say, we were very disappointed! Thought we ordered a lot of food but the portions were tiny. The food was average nothing to rave about but the most shocking part is our bill was $60 before tip!!! Did I mention this was during happy hour! & no leftovers... Will not be returning that's for sure.
2672	1	a	Overall the food was great. Took my family here for lunch. No kids menu but they have a descent  Mac and cheese for a side dish. Chrissy chicken and pulled pork sandwiches were delicious.
2673	1	a	Our server Paul was great! The Mac and cheese was delicious! The green beans are a must! The chandeliers are really cool! \n\nIt's good to have another fun option at Town Square. It seems like we're always going to Yard House, Brio, or CPK. This a Southern style BBQ joint with some unique food options that I'm too picky to try.
2674	1	a	Fried green tomato salad and the pork belly appetizers are a must! The ribs were amazing as well! Great beer list and cocktail menu. Beth the bartender was great.
2675	0	a	"Imitation fast made BBQ. Reliant on the sauces for any flavor.  Got the combination plate to sample each meat.  \n\nFirst- the good.  The Mac&Cheese was outstanding!\n\nThe bad-\nThe brisket was 90% fat 10% meat. (See picture) the \""pulled pork\"" isn't even pulled!! It's chopped up!  You can see the blade cuts and it's all blocky, not stringy like a pulled pork is!  \n\nCandied yams were just O.K.\n\nThis is lazy BBQ at Town Square prices.\n\nEDIT: To add-  the atmosphere is very nice.  I could go here for a drink at the bar, and be very comfortable in this Industrial/Americana setting."
2676	0	a	The candied yams and French fries with white sauce are a must.  The wait service was very good.   Our waiter took the time to explain the menu and type of cuisine on the menu. \n\nEverything else we had was a disappointment.  My husband said it is like the chef used the wrong recipe for his meal (pulled pork looked like chicken?) and my brisket was so like three days old dry.  Good brisket should almost melt in your mouth and be so savory you don't notice the space in between bites.   We did not finish our meals.  We lied and said we were full.  \n\nAnd perhaps this is because they are new but there was no diaper changing station.  Fail for mamas!  \n\nWon't go back.
2677	1	a	"First and foremost, our food was great!!\nThe staff was awesome and very friendly. The Manager (Francis) came by to say hi and thank us for coming in. We were a lunch party of 8. Everyone at the table enjoyed the lunch.\n\nI would definitely go back! Although maybe not for lunch. The food took a long time to show up, even though as I said...maybe worth the wait? From sitting to ordering to getting our food was 45 minutes. On a regular lunch break, it is too long for me.\n\nLuckily this was a \""work lunch\"" so a long lunch we could all get away with.\nAnd thankfully it was a \""work is treating lunch\"" because they have one menu for lunch and dinner. My 1/2 order of ribs was $18, which is a little bit rich for my lunch budget. Wish they had a cheaper lunch menu, might reconsider. Although I did see a couple lunch sandwiches in the corner of the menu. But I mean a smaller portion, less than $10 lunch menu. \n\nBut with all that said, I would go back, for sure! This will be a super tasty place to go before a movie at Town Square, or the place to eat with friends on a night out. When time is not an issue, and $18 for dinner entree is fine!"
2678	0	a	Not sure where to even start!  We were the first ones in for lunch, our food took an hour and the order was incorrect - my husband did note when he pulled up, that the cooks were outside smoking cigarettes...  The waitress was this annoying blond, who kept interrupting our conversation to say mindless things.  Now the food - ugh, tasteless, overpriced, fatty crap - ugh, none of us liked our meal. Go to Famous Daves or Lucille for better b-que!
2679	0	a	We loved the ambience and location, but our service was slow and our food was less than expected in taste. We relied on the sauces whereas most ribs are enjoyed alone.\nWe had the pulled pork, two types of ribs, and our sides were Hoppin John and Corn Succotash. Not much for flavor on anything. \nOther than overpriced drinks, the atmosphere is fantastic and the hostesses were helpful and welcoming.
2680	1	a	"Seriously the best BBQ in Las Vegas...and I've tried them all.  We ordered a full rack of spareribs and baby back ribs and the moment the plate arrived, we knew that we were in for something special.  Amazing quality and quantity...honestly, I've never seen so much meat on a rib before and I'd swear that we were each given several pounds of pure meat.  This is the first time I have not been able to finish my \""rack\"" of anything on the first sitting...not even close, I brought half of the ribs home.\n\nMuch like the meat, the side dishes were incredible.  My wife had sweet potatoes that were plentiful and topped with marshmellow and the report was \""best I've ever had\"".  We both had excellent green beans.  And the Mac & Cheese...wow...honestly the best I've ever had...large and cheesy and creamy.\n\nWe eat 99.5% of our meals out and it's not often that we're pleasantly surprised by a new restaurant.  Well, our hat is of to Pot Liquor CAS.  We've already settled on the fact that the next time we feel like BBQ...this is the place!"
2681	0	a	I was really frustrated with my two experiences with Pot Liquor.\n\nMy first experience I ordered my food to go. (This was roughly a month ago right when they opened) I'm a town square employee and I figured that order 30 minutes in advance would provide them with ample time to complete my order. I walked in and the hostess told me to take a seat at the bar. The bartender was prompt in providing my check and a glass of water. After that, the experience went downhill. Fast forward to me asking where my food was multiple times in the next 45 minutes. They still had not brought it out and I asked them to refund my card. Disappointment was an understatement. Also, they didn't reverse the transaction.\n\nYesterday, I opted to give them another try because I figured that the first experience was just a hiccup with them opening initially. They got my food out in an adequate amount of time, but when I went to eat my food in our break room, they gave me a grilled chicken sandwich when I asked for the fried chicken sandwich. I asked for no tomatoes due to a food allergy, and low and behold, tomatoes were on my sandwich.\n\nI tried to give them another chance and they messed up again, needless to say, I will not be returning. I was really excited about a different option within the mall, but sadly they still have some kinks to work out. However, I'll most likely not be retuning to see if those kinks ever get addressed.
2682	0	a	I'm frustrated at the overpromotion of this place. The meat is extremely salty and not nearly as good as other BBQ in this town, and this is a bad town for BBQ. The place is no bargain, and I'm not a fan of overly tattoed and botoxed servers.
2683	1	a	Only been here one time so far but it was really good. Good appetizers, salads, BBQ and drinks. I will definitely check it out again sometime. Cool vibe inside with bar, tv's, etc plus it's in town square so there are plenty of things to do in the area. I would recommend checking it out!
2684	0	a	Seems like a tourist trap. Overpriced for the food. Atmosphere was great. Service was great. Unfortunately the food was not great. Won't be back.
2685	0	a	My husband and I went on Friday to have a couple of drinks and apps at the bar.  We ordered the deviled eggs which were just ok.  The burnt ends, were not burnt and was just a pile of fat.  We also order the pork rinds, the menu states they have a chili lime salt, which I could not taste at all.  The drinks were ok, the bartenders seem to be in panic mode with trying to measure every ounce.  I may go back to try something on the dinner menu but no rush.
2686	0	a	Ok we came in after the Santa parade trying to find a place to have a quick dinner. Smelled good and seemed promising. Food gets 1 star, but I added another star since their service is actually great. Everyone was so nice, helpful, and quick to service. My daughters had ribs with fries. The ribs were\nNot cooked properly and were  still on the raw side. We wanted to order their crab appetizer but they said they were out, so were ordered their hummus and prawns. Prawns had no taste. Hummus was ok, nothing special to rave about   After I tried ordering a sandwich and told I could only have it for lunch we got annoyed and left. Best thing there was prob my sons chicken fingers, but not what I would want for dinner
2687	0	a	After recently moving to LV from the deep south my fiance and I were quite excited to find a new BBQ joint because we both love the stuff.  However, Pot Liquor was very disappointing.\n\nHighs:\n-Service! There was a French gentleman (owner or manager) who was very nice and our waiter did the best he could considering the ridiculous wait times.\n\n-Baked crab app was delicious.\n\n-Kale cashew slaw was delightful.\n\nLows:\n-Service was EXTREMELY slow.  Dining room was half full and it took 45 minutes for the apps, then another 45 for the entrees to appear.  I had beer but my fiance's cocktail took 20 mins.  Smoked meats aren't done to order so I have no idea what the hold up was.\n\n-A terrible smell, sewage or grease trap meant we had to move tables.  The issue was handled well and there were plenty of tables to choose from but be warned it was nauseating.\n\n-BBQ overall was not very good. The pulled pork was in fact chopped and both the seasoning and smokiness were tepid.  Lot of fat left on board too.\n\n-Chicken was mediocre and all the sides (except slaw) were under seasoned.\n\n\nI know that this place just opened and  the service issues could just be kinks but you have to nail the BBQ down. This place is pricey and it's just not worth us trying it again to see if they've figured it out yet.
2688	1	a	"I will gladly drink the Pot Liquor here!! This was a great dining experience!\n\nA large group of us made reservations for Pot Liquor CAS for a Tuesday night (to take advantage of the Happy Hour Tuesday special- 25% off the entire menu). The hostess was SO friendly and warm and seated us right away. The restaurant is beautiful, gorgeous chandeliers, red brick walls, and really struck the right balance between down-home BBQ and upscale. \n\nThe food- DELICIOUS! I was able to sample the Deviled Eggs, which were a little more mustard-y than I prefer (I like mine a bit sweeter), but the cracklins on top were a great touch!\n\nYou could easily make a meal from sampling a few of the appetizer options, and some of our party did. My mom and I decided to be fatties and split the \""Go Hog Wild\"" plate, which included dry rubbed spareribs, pulled pork, baby back ribs, and hot links as well as two side dishes (mac & cheese and candied yams). We also got a side of brisket, cause... we just had to! THANK GOODNESS our server let us know that these plates were meant to be shared! \n\nBoth varieties of ribs were very tender, well seasoned and yummy! There were 3 types BBQ sauce served on the side. The brisket wasn't as tender as I like, but it had a good flavor. The hot links had a kick to them, also very good.  The only thing that I didn't like so much was the pulled pork. \n\nThe side dishes were also fantastic. I could eat that mac & cheese every day! \n\nMy only real complaint is that the food is served just warm- I like my meals to be piping hot, but that's just a personal preference. \n\nOne of my friends got the chicken pot pie, which had a puff pastry topping, and that looked really delicious as well- I'll be back to sample that! \n\nWe couldn't leave without trying dessert, so we ordered the brownie bread pudding... AMAZING!!  The perfect balance, not too sweet, and the gelato on top was a great compliment. \n\nThe service was great all around, and the waitress even very kindly split the checks for us. The hostess even took tons of pictures of our group after we finished eating.\n\nI am definitely a fan, and I will be back for more of this liquor!"
2689	0	a	In our group recently, the men enjoyed a gigantic sandwich of meats and meats, with bacon.  The fries were among the best ever we've had.\n  BUT southren* cooking doesn't have to come with a layer of fat 1/3 thick on smoked brisket. And a body expects the brisket to be tender.  Pot Liquor's dipping and barbecue sauces are unnecessarily inventive--all the barbecue sauces were composed on the same overly - hot base. The mayo-based horseradish/lemon zest sauce was bland and puzzling. We tried a smattering of other traditional southern dishes,  but they were disappointing enough to be unmemorable. Prices were high for the quality.\nService was super friendly and excellent. The store doesn't slam you with loud music.\nMe going back? Nope. Guys might for the sandwich and fries. Order 1 of them for two.
2690	0	a	Today I read a food critic's column in the Las Vegas Review Journal's NEON section which gave 4 A ' s to a new restaurant at Town Square, POT LIQUOR CAS. Wow, I thought! 4 A's. This must be a great place. So off we went to dinner with another couple with grand visions of a fabulous meal to come. This restaurant is far from fabulous, not 4 A's as described in the column. Not even close! The food arrived cold, the brisket was more fat than meat and not very tender, the ribs were dry and unappealing; the mac and cheese side was bland and had not a taste of cheese; one of my dining companions sent his brisket back in exchange for the pulled pork but, after arriving looking like half a football, it too was sent back. The waiter was pleasant enough and sent an assistant manager who advised he'd get some less fatty brisket. This 3rd replacement was better with less fat. My complaint to the general manager was handled very poorly with no accommodation.  This was followed with a complaint to the chef - owner who responded with no emotion. I gave this place a one star rating because the cornbread muffin was just ok and the water was wet! We eat out often and I've not ever felt so used and cheated.
2691	1	a	We were in the mood for ribs and our friends, who had eaten here before, let us know that there was 25 percent off for locals on Tuesday night. While I had always been a fan of Famous Daves and Lucille's, I was more than happy to try this place that was offering a nice discount. I ordered the mopped baby back ribs which I shared with my wife. We got two sides with it. We ordered the Hoppin John and the Mellowed Candied Yams.\n\nThe ribs were among the best ribs I've ever eaten. First of all they were meatier than any ribs I've ever gotten in the past. Even with two of us sharing a full rack, we were not even close to being able to finish it. The portion was huge. They were cooked to perfection. And I really liked that they weren't swimming in barbecue sauce. They just seem to put a small amount on to give it a little flavor. They did give a small container of BBQ sauce on the side for those people who wanted even more. But to my mind the amount that it came with was close to perfect. The Hoppin John side dish was a rice dish with some beans in it ( not really sure what kind of beans they were). That dish was absolutely delicious. A perfect accompaniment to the ribs. The mellowed candied yams are also very good. They were a little too sweet for my taste but what should I expect when the word candied is in the name.\nThis is now my go-to place for ribs. Goodbye Famous Daves and Lucille's.
2692	1	a	Popped in for lunch one day after deciding to try something new.  Glad we did.  Amazing brisket sandwich!!!!  I'm not sure if it was the owner that greeted us when we arrived, but he was very nice in fact everyone was extremely pleasant.  Glad we found a new lunch place in Town Square.
2693	0	a	It's apparent the kitchen has no idea how to operate.  The food was good.  I was not upset with that. However 50 mins for bbq is absurd.  Bbq should be done. \n\nThe owners friend sat next to us and they had no problem getting food early with prompt service. We however, were not given the same respect or service from staff...\n\nIt's unfortunate because I was really looking forward to trying this place in hopes for good bbq in LV
2694	0	a	"I came across Pot Liquors as I was walking around Town Square the other night. I was checking out the menu when the hostess came out to talk a little about the restaurant. She mentioned they were doing a \""Thanksgiving Meal\"". So doing a little more research on the places, reading a lot of positive reviews, I convinced my mom to cancel our original plans and to try this new restaurant instead. Unfortunately that was a big mistake. \n\nI really wanted to like this place after reading all the reviews on the food and the service. The same hostess that I encountered the other night sat us rather promptly. That was probably the only positive thing about our experience. It all went down hill from there. From the time we got sat, it took 15 minutes for a server to come over and help us. And if it wasnt for the hostess walking by asking us if a server had helped us yet, we'd probably still be there waiting for a server. And it wasnt that busy. Finally a young server named Kristen showed up and took our order. My mom and I ordered the special thanksgiving meal. The drinks arrived promptly. Several minutes later the server came back to inform us that they were out of the butternut squash soup and asked if cream of mushroom would be ok to substitute. I really didnt care either way. 10 minutes after she took our order the soup finally arrived. I wish it would have stayed back in the kitchen. The temperature was luke warm at best. At least I didnt have to worry about burning myself. After finishing our soups another 15 minutes passed before our main entrees arrived. That's probably because they were sitting out for 15 minutes, allowing them to cool down. Not one item of food on the plate was hot. Again, like the soup, everything was luke warm. I pushed the plate to the side and waiting for our server to stop by. Unfortunately she was too busy watching football at the bar. I had to walk up to get her and tell her our food was cold. She apologized and took it back. Maybe a little more than 5 minutes later she come back with new plates. Unfortunately nothing changed. Everything on the plate was still luke warm. The gravy on the turkey was actually congealed. A sign that it had been sitting out and cooled. Again I pushed the plate to the side. This time I got up to get a manager. The plates got taken back a 2nd time. Then the manager came back and asked if we would like something else instead of the Thanksgiving menu. After a few minutes we decided to try it a 3rd time. Before this, the manager came back to try to explain about the turkey and why it was a little cool. The turkey wasnt the problem, it was everything else that was cold. The manager was even on the verge of being argumentative, saying the the chefs personally prepared the 2nd dish and blah blah blah. A 3rd version of the meal came, personally served by the manager. I was hoping that the 3rd time's a charm. But it was the same thing. A cold meal. And this time my mom's plate didnt have the sweet potatoes. Instead it had this sauerkraut looking type side. Still wasnt sure what it was. My mom barely at anything on her plate. I did finish my meal, only because I was hungry. Needless to say we also didnt see the manager stop by for the rest of the night. Guess he really didnt care if we were happy with our 3rd round.\n\nThe previous reviewer, Ryan R. I wish I would have had your meal. And while my mom was waiting for me to pay the bill she was talking with 2 couples outside who loved their experience. They said everything they had was excellent. Again, I wish I had their meal instead of what we were served.\n\nNow the million dollar question. Would I go back? Probably not. As much as I want to try their BBQ it is a little on the expensive side. I can get a kick-ass BBQ meal at Jack Stacks in KC, MO and pay half the price. If I do return to Pot Liquors, it will be to have a drink at the bar, just to see a cute female asian bartender who is covered in tattoos. Just because I am in to that sort of thing.\n\nWe should have stuck with the reservations at Mimi's."
2695	0	a	Came here on black Friday for the first time, was out of top entrees, no excuse for that, the cornbread sucks very very bland, how can u have a bbq place without awesome cornbread???, burger not cooked to order, ordered medium came our well done. Cool looking place but food is not up to true Bbq standards.\n\n maybe will be a better experience next time, if I ever come again but I'm doubting that. Very disappointed in this place, was looking for some great bbq, but did not receive it at all. \n\nBacon on the burger was good tho along with the fries, not so much the entrees though.  Mediocre place for what it's talked up to be.\n\n Definitely not a 4 star restaurant. Venue is decorated nice but it does not match the food. \n\nProbably won't be back. Sorry not sorry
2696	1	a	Finally some good BBQ in Vegas!  We came with the Fam and ordered the Lord Have Mercy which has 1/2 smoked chicken, 6 bones baby back ribs, 6 bones spareribs, Carolina pulled pork, 4 Louisiana hot links.  It comes with 3 sides and we added a couple more.  I love me some sides.  We got Mac N Cheese, Corn Bread, Cabot Grits, Mellowed Candied Yams and Fries w/ Alabama White Sauce.  The Lord Have Mercy is a lot of food!  The meat and sides were great.  There were a few things that while were still good, weren't what I was expecting.  I thought the Alabama white sauce was going to be a white BBQ sauce like they have in the south but it seemed like it was just a side of mayo.  The Cabot Grits tasted like regular grits, I thought they were going to be cheesy.  Not a big deal but I was a little disappointed.  Service was good, food took awhile but was worth the wait.  They have a great all day happy hour on Tuesdays, 25% off the entire menu and you do not have to sit at the bar!
2697	0	a	"I only gave this one star because yelp would not let me write with no stars lit. We ordered a drink, an appetizer, and a combo platter for my birthday dinner tonite. The drink and the deviled eggs came out right away and both were great.\n\nAn unusually long time later our platter came out. Brisket, chicken and pulled pork with Mac and cheese and green beans. The presentation was great, with the server explaining each of the three sauces. Everything looked great, until we started eating. Everything was cold. \n\nWe sent the platter back and got platter #2. SAME PROBLEM!!!!!  All of the meat was cold, one of the slabs of brisket was a half slice of fat and burnt beef, and all of the sides were smaller portions. \n\nMy wife asked for the manager, who begged us not to leave  and allow him to \""make it right\"" and told the waiter to \""take care of this\"" waving his hands around our table. After waiting AGAIN for our meal, we finally got one that was at least hot. At this point we just wanted to leave. But wait, it's not over!  After waiting for anther 15 minutes (during which the hostess who had obviously overdone the Xanax that night weirdly offered us more water) THEY BROUGHT THE CHECK !!!  And they had the balls to charge full price!!\n\nMy wife paid the check in order to get us the hell out of Satans kitchen, convinced that the producer of whatever hidden camera show we were on would surely arrive and tell us it was all a joke and we had been punked. On the way out, zombie hostess told us to \""get home safe and warm....\""\nPLEASE GO ANYWHERE BUT HERE TO EAT!!!!  I can't imagine that this place will be open much longer."
2698	1	a	I know I'm a little posting this review.  Came here for lunch on vacation (second home from home) in November on 11/20/14.  Menu is awesome.  Gluten Free Meats and Sides.\n\nOf course I had to try a little bit of my sisters food and fiance's.  :)\n\nMy sister had the Fried Green Tomato Salad.  First time having Fried Green Tomato and it was really good.  My fiance had the Carolina Pulled Pork Sandwich.  Pork was pretty tasty, piled high.  I had the Texas Beef Brisket 8oz with two sides Collard Greens and Macaroni & Cheese.  The sides are huge portions.  It served all three of us.  Brisket was on point.  Delicious!!!!!!  I would definitely become here again and try something new.
2699	1	a	Pot Liquor is a must go if you're near the town center. As a new establishment, Pot Liquor serves some awesome BBQ in a modern environment with an industrial style decor. The service was fast and although the menu was pricey, the food was well worth the money. I ordered the half baby back ribs with macaroni and cheese, potato salad, and their homemade staple cornbread. Phenomenal. I wasn't impressed with their potato salad, and I do not recommend it. However, I do recommend their ribs. The half rack was more than enough and each piece was packed with plenty of delicious meat. I also enjoyed their robust beer list and definitely recommend their Full Sail Amber Ale. To top it off, the General Manager Francis was extremely nice and welcoming. We enjoyed our conversation with him when he personally checked up on us and asked us how our meal was. Overall, I would definitely recommend this up and coming establishment to others.
2700	0	a	We arrived on a Tuesday night reservation for six. The special for the night was 25% off your entire bill, sounded like a great deal, problem was they meant 25% of the menu wasn't available. When we checked in for our reservation we were informed that there were no ribs available. Really a rib house with no ribs available....hmmm. We sit down and before we can get our orders out we were informed that there was no brisket available either. You've got to be kidding me. I'm looking for a camera now. And have to settle for the pulled pork sandwich and fries, only I can't order a sandwitch it's only available for lunch I can only get sliders. Very poorly managed restaurant is what I'm thinking. What food we did receive was good but don't think I will return.
2701	0	a	"If I could post zero stars, that's what I would do.  Let me preface this with the fact that we got here at 7pm on a Saturday...busy time for sure, but a restaurant should be able to forecast for that. After placing our orders, our waiter let's me know that I got the last order of brisket available (again, it's only 7pm on a saturday). Next, our food comes and here's where the real fun starts. My Mom's pulled pork looks chopped (as opposed to actually pulled) and it's DRY AS A BONE. I live in Chicago and maybe I'm a bit of a BBQ snob, but meats should be able to stand on their own...they shouldn't  require sauce to make it moist or give it taste. Best part? They didn't have enough containers for sauce to go around so we had to wait like 5 minutes before they even brought us any! Now, on to my entree.  I ordered 8oz of brisket. Sadly, ~3oz of it is fat and gristle. For $19, I think I deserve a full 8oz of edible meat. My wife's ribs were OK, but definitely not great. Our sides were pretty \""meh\"" all around. All of the most new at our table were fairly tasteless (Mac & cheese, candied yams, corn succatash, cornbread)...definitely nothing great. Oh, and they kept forgetting stuff. My cornbread came out without any butter, and my mom's Mac n cheese came out like 5-7 minutes after the rest of our food. All in all, for what they are charging, I'd be expecting a WHOLE lot more."
2702	0	a	It's 830pm on a Sat and there is NO BRISKET. How is that possible? Mac & Cheese was cheesy, but flavorless. Corn bread was ok - Marie Callendars does it better. Since there was no brisket and I don't eat pork, I opted for a cheeseburger and had to ask for BBQ sauce on the side since they don't offer a BBQ burger. Very disappointed. My bill was $24, $30 with tip for waiter that did a good job of explaining menu items and offering drink suggestions. I left unsatisfied and thinking I could of eaten much better at Famous Dave's for what I paid.
2703	1	a	This place is great! Coming from the south where ribs are a staple, I can honestly say the dry rub ribs are awesome as are some of the sides such as kale and cashew slaw, green beans, and mac and cheese.  My favorite though is the pork belly and grits (to die for!  This dish is a must have and an all time fave of my family's and makes my mouth water just thinking about them.  My husband is an executive chef who has worked in three star Michelin restaurants and has a position at a highly prestigious restaurant on the strip....he agrees, the pork belly and grits are the bomb!  :)
2704	1	a	"Having traveled around the country and been a diner at several of the finest of Carolina, St. Louis, Kansas City, and Austin Barbecue spots - let me explain first of all that (as a Vegas resident I sadly say this) - Vegas will probably never \""get\"" barbecue culture.  I wish it did.  \n\nHowever, Pot Liquor cares about many of the right things and is as passable for high quality barbecue as we probably will ever get 'round these parts.  \n\nPositives:\n1 - Service was exceptional, beginning to end.  Pleasant as pie, perfect amount of attention.  Maitre D to waitress to manager.  Perfect.\n\n2 - Really interesting menu.  And drink list.  This is a gourmet interpretation of barbecue.  There are some cool salads, apps.  \n\n3 - Great portion size, but probably too much for any one person to eat. \n\n\nIssues:\n\nBurnt ends:\nAt least the way I have experienced them, were not quite that burnt, and not quite end pieces.  These seemed like more of a pork belly cooked a fair amount.\n\nOverall selection:\nThey feature specialties from so many parts of the barbecue belt (Carolina pulled pork, Ribs Texas style and memphis style, etc).  I think they need to perfect one technique and go with it.\n\nOverall - the best Vegas has so I'm not complaining!"
2705	1	a	Excellent southern BBQ. Large portions. Staff is very friendly and attentive. Dry rub on the spare rubs is very good. Excellent selection of whiskeys. If you're not sure which one to try ask and they will give you a recommendation.
2706	0	a	Unfortunately everything that my husband and I ordered was unsatisfactory. The burnt ends were extremely dry, and the crab cakes and chili were terribly bland. On a brighter note, the sweet tea was delicious.
2707	0	a	Took family here for Christmas Dinner. Made reservation so wait wasn't too bad.\nPlace appeared to be packed. When seated noticed numerous empty tables even though there were numerous parties waiting to be seated. Turns out they were way under staffed. Only three waiters working. Dinner took over an hour to be served.\nThe food was mediocre at best. Beef Brisket was fair, Lucille's is ten times better.Short Ribs tasted like they dumped the salt shaker on them. Burnt Ends Appitizer was grisly and chewy. None of the dishes served were much to brag about. \nI predict it will be one of those Resturants that after a short while and the hype is over it will be gone. There are a whole lot of better bar-b-que resturantsin Las Vegas.
2708	0	a	"I thought that Lucille's BBQ in Las Vegas is much better.  Pot Liquor has big portions and big prices.  I had the Spare Ribs, which were good, but nothing amazing.  I thought that the portion was way too big for lunch and wish that they had some lunch options\n\nThe service was \""OK.\""  It was a typical \""What do you recommend?\"" \""Oh, everything is good\"" service. If you come to Pot Liquor, just don't come with high expectations."
2709	1	a	Got the recommendation from a friend at work. When we got there it was just before 3pm. My wife Lori and I decided to come on a Tuesday because of the 25% off the entire menu and drinks. There was hardly any one there. We were promptly seated and our server Dave came over, he was very cordial and helpful with suggestions.  Before coming there we checked out the menu online and we thought we had a plan on what we were ordering. We both ordered the Pork Belly over grits.  This was one of those dishes that you continually make that mmmmm sound while you're eating. \n\nWe also ordered the deviled eggs which were good also. I ordered the skirt steak over ox tail ragu and Lori stayed from the plan and ordered the Spare Me Baby, which were baby backs, dry rubbed and mopped  spare ribs, that comes with two sides she got the mac and cheese and the fries with Alabama white sauce. When the food came out we were floored at the portion size!  Everything was tasty. My steak was ordered med rare, it was a little tough but manageable. It was served over hoppin johns which were really good. Lori could only eat one baby back and one of the dry rubbed ribs. \nNeedless to say our eyes were bigger than our stomachs, we were so stuffed and we didn't finish it all. Dave came by smiling and offered to pack it all up for us. Overall the meal was great and we plan to visit again and try some other things on the menu. We also tried one of the lemonades too I had the sidecar and Lori had the cucumber one. They were also very good. \nI highly recommend this place, just make sure you are hungry because the portion sizes are huge and you will be stuffed when you leave.
2710	1	a	I had seen this place walking thru Town Square quite a few times, so some co-workers and I decided to try it on a Tuesday because of the 25% off the entire menu and drinks. The restaurant was pretty quiet when we arrived and we were promptly seated. Our server was very prompt in taking care of us and very helpful with suggestions. My co-workers and I started with a cocktail, I had the Raspberry Tart which was very tasty! We then ordered the burnt ends appetizer to start, and we then decided to order a variety of items to share so that we could try a lil bit of everything..... we had the Carolina Pulled Pork Sandwich, the Texas Dip, and an order of the Macaroni and Cheese. Everything was great- but OMG the Macaroni and Cheese was sooooooo yummy! Definitely a must try! \n\nI would highly recommend Pot Liquor! Great food! Great atmosphere! Great service!
2711	1	a	A great place to eat, drink and make merry with friends.  We have made it a regular and always enjoy the food and especially the staff!  Make sure you go!
2712	0	a	"This BBQ was not good, dry and no flavor. The  pot liquor greens were sour (I've had pot liquor greens when I went to Atlanta, never tasted any as bad as these were). The Mac cheese make a pretty picture and when your going in your thinking, \""these are going to be good\"", not. The candied yams, yuck on that and just makes a pretty picture. The price for the BBQ is too high for lousy food. The hot links were horrible too, not hot at all. I don't see them lasting long unless they get someone in that kitchen who can cook good pot liquor greens, Mac n cheese and candied yams. Anyone raving about this haven't had better. I just can't recommend it.  Service was nice but that is not enough to spend my hard earned money on it again."
2713	0	a	I've been there twice.\n\nThe first time, the food was good and the service was great.\n\nThe second time, the food was just OK, their best dish (pork belly & grits) was not available and the service was poor.
2714	1	a	We found this spot by accident, and we were not disappointed!  The satay was moist and delightful.  We tried the beef basil and the kang kung belacan at the chef's recommendation.  Don't miss the coconut pudding served inside a coconut-- it was delicious.  Service is very friendly and attentive.  Enjoy!
2715	0	a	My friends and I stopped here to eat on the way back from Prescott. First of all, the cashier never greeted us. I ordered a char grilled bbq sandwich by itself,  and when I told her that she had to get her manager to punch it into the register. My two other friends ordered specialized meals and they messed both of theirs up as well.\n\nIt took 10 minutes to complete my order and 15-20 minutes to complete my friend's orders. They messed both orders up and they had to be remade, tacking on another 5 minutes to the order time. \n\nOverall, the service there was horrible and they couldn't understand simple instructions when we ordered the food. Other customers in there looked like they had the same issues. The manager on duty didn't look like she knew what she was doing, so that didn't help the situation at all either.
2716	0	a	Ordered a few meal we where the only ones ordering food. The guy had to be reminded twice for my daughter shake which she never got til she was done eating cause he was too busy playing around with his co workers
2717	1	a	Soooooo happy the east side finally has an amazing juice bar-NEKTER-\nLove all of the juice options and the staff are amazingly fun and friendly!    This will bet 2nd home
2718	0	a	I have been to this location twice now and while the juice is great the service is horrible. Today I stood at the counter for five minutes before I was even acknowledged by anyone and when someone finally came out I asked them questions about the cleanse and got one word answers and she seemed very disinterested in helping me. Their aren't many choices for juice in the East Valley and I would like a more friendly experience when I walk in to this one.
2719	1	a	This is the smallest LA Fitness gym that I'm aware of here in AZ.  This was the nicer Pure Fitness that they acquired years ago and they just recently opened it.  It has limited amenities compared to other locations (no racquetball, no basketball, no pool, no sauna).  Regardless - It has everything that one needs to get a decent work out in.  The upside for me is that this is an EXTRA gym in-between the McCormick Ranch and the Tatum gyms!  So I'm grateful for the addition.  Plus, you can park and go to the movie, get a protein shake, hang out at the coffee shop and choose between several restaurants in addition to a workout - without having to drive around.
2720	0	a	This place is the size of a closet and unlike the huge, sprawling location on Greenway, has no TV's on any of the cardio machines and a fairly lackluster assortment of weights/ weight machines. \n\nI really despise the lack of consistency among LA Fitness gyms in the Valley. I'm not sure why they'd build a new location in an upscale area of N. Scottsdale and not have the most sophisticated / updated equipment in it. Also, this location offers NO spin classes!!!!
2721	0	a	Horrible customer service. Went with a friend and she was interested in signing up, when we walked in the staff was not friendly. They said I didn't have a guest pass on my account. They did not let my friend work out, so we left. She no longer wants a membership.
2722	1	a	I followed Perla over from her previous salon at Bombshell Hair. She is an amazing hair extension stylist that I have been using for over 2 years. I have recommended many of my girlfriends and all of their hair turns out amazing.
2723	1	a	Perla was the first stylist I was fortunate to meet here in Vegas..6 years ago !\n Now that I have aged she has done great work on blending colors so my WHITE roots look naturally blondish amongst my auburn hair .. Love that she can work miracles !.. Beautiful new salon Perla ,Congrats !
2724	1	a	Perla is who I go to @ Vavoom! She's the best , I followed her from Bombshell Hair & Extension Co. And I have to say out of all the 5 diff stylists I've had since I've been living in Vegas, they can't top her or even come close to her ! Not only is she great w hair & knows the art, but she also is very enjoyable to be around, always in a positive mood no matter what! She's just an all around awesome person to know  so anyone that's looking to get extensions done or color etc , I highly recommend you go see Perla @ Vavoom. You'll thank me later!!
2725	1	a	Saxby and I stopped by TD's today after karate class to get something for dinner and use a TD gift card I've been sitting on for almost a year now. \nWe picked up enough food for two dinners a bottle of wine and dessert and a couple of other things and spent $40!\nThe staff is super friendly, the quality of product is unbelievable and the variety of wine and beer is incredible! Trader Joe's is our new grocery store.
2726	1	a	Grocery shopping makes me a happy camper and this new location within Downtown Summerlin location is no exception! This is in super-duper convenient location (right off Sahara and 215 beltway) with plenty of parking, spacious isles, stocked full of specialty items (IE: loads of cookie butter and other TJ goodness), and that impeccable customer service that I adore. Clearly, I am excited  that this location opened up and will take the place of my other frequented Trader Joe location on Washington Ave.\n \nNeed more reasons to love Trader Joes? Try this... \n\nThey carry an ever-changing list of products that are minimally processed (hello seasonal items - Fall pumpkin extravaganza products - or Christmas white chocolate peppermint pretzels). They also cater to those who are health conscious! Whether you're looking for gluten free snacks, fresh organic fruits and veggies, wild-caught fish, organic products, free-range chicken, organic eggs .... Trader Joe's has G-O-T you covered. Trust me.... You don't need all the added junk that traditional grocery stores add to their products. Cut to the chase and come here get the real deal for bottom dollar pricing that will make you (and your wallet) very happy.
2727	1	a	Absolutely best Trader Joe's I have been to so far in Las Vegas and San Antonio. First off Trader joes has amazing prices vs. Other grocery stores. The selections of pre made dips and different meats is the number one thing I  love about it. Its is one of the only stores that I have seen carry Hawaiian shorts ribs already marinaded!! (Mmmm). They don't have tons of produce but they do have a good selection. They have awesome bouquets of fresh flowers that are super cheap! Natural shampoos, toothpaste, ect. Dog food, wine, gluten free selections, and on on!!\n\nIn think it was such a great idea to hide a fake  parrot....or at this store it's a sea horse, to keep kids occupied while shopping. If they find the hidden Sea horse they get a treat. Yay!!!  They have these adorable little kids carts too which my kids loved!
2728	0	a	The only reason I tried this new location is because it's closer to my home than the ones on Washington or Decatur, however, I like both of those locations better. \n\nIt was opening day so of course it was crowded, however, I went to get everything pumpkin spice and they were missing my faves. I got what I could there but still had to go to the other locations to get what I needed. \n\nI will try one more time when the novelty of Downtown Summerlin wears off but in the mean time, I'll go to the one on West Washington since the staff is more experience and hella more friendly. If you need something there they will search until they find it.\n\nI wish all the locations were open 24/7 since we all have food allergies and organic is essential to avoid ER visits. I'm just happy with the close proximity for now.
2729	1	a	What's not to love about Trader Joe's!  The location in the corner of the Downtown Summerlin parking lot is convenient.  Even better it's an exit away from my house.  I first went when it was still fairly new and they had people directing traffic and still not a problem to get in and out of.   Just like the other locations in town it's clean and everything is easy to find and there is always assistance nearby if you need it.  My only complaint would be lack of cart returns but I understand that TJ's was limited on requesting additional ones.  Could be my imagination but I feel like the aisles are also wider.  And I think the placement of the food sample area location was smart as it's in a corner so not causing cart back up and crowds like I've seen at the Buffalo location.
2730	1	a	FINALLY! So glad this is now open. No complaints here so far. Take into consideration that it's brand new and it's still being worked on. Staff is ALWAYS extremely helpful and nice. Food is amazing. This location saves me about a 45 minute round trip to the other location. Thank you.
2731	0	a	Food is uninspired, dry, tasteless and bland.  Not worth the effort, not just because of the food, but because it is always busy for some reason.
2732	1	a	The Grilled Market Salad was amazing and the service was too! Nice to see happy people who love their job's! I'll definitely be back!
2733	0	a	Nice clean location, friendly staff. \nTwo stars because they have, and I have let them, forget my ice cream cone twice.
2734	1	a	I'm so glad I found Lesli! It's hard to find someone really good to do your hair in Vegas so when I found Lesli I was so relieved. She really cares about her clients and wants them to look good. I like how she pays attention to details and wants you to leave happy- definitely recommend !
2735	1	a	"I found Leslie when I first came to Vegas & had to have her \""fix\"" my hair color from another hair salon. Leslie is amazing!!! So friendly & fun, makes you feel like you've known her for years. Her work is absolutely the best. I highly recommend her."
2736	1	a	Lesli is not only an amazing,  talented and precise hairdresser,  she is also a genuine, caring person! When you find a person like her who is good and takes so much pride in their job and is a bona-fide good person, you keep coming back. Thank you Lesli!
2737	0	a	After hearing the commercial a 100th time on the radio I decided to finally try this place. First impression was the shitty attitude of the girl working the register. When I finally got my club sub I was really unimpressed. I won't be coming back anytime in the future. There's way better options in Tempe.
2738	1	a	Came here on a Monday afternoon to pick up a few sandwiches and some iced coffee. \n\nInterior was nice and clean. Definitely smaller than the other 2 locations. It was a little hot inside due to the doors being open.\n\nService was good. The cashier informed us of their grand opening special and gave us 2 flyers to redeem the deal. Since they have been only open a few days, they didn't have their credit card machine up and running yet - so we had to pay with cash instead. \n\nFood was good. Ordered a Chinese meatball sandwich, a grilled pork sandwich, and 2 iced coffees. Bread was warm and soft with a crunchy exterior. Iced coffee was delicious!
2739	0	a	Everytime i come here theres never bobba! And they take forever to make sandwiches :/ save your money and time, go to the one on eastern and 215.
2740	0	a	I typically enjoy Lee's sandwiches but this location specifically employees moronic individuals who have Absolutely No Customer Service and do not give a $*** about their customers. This is my 4th time in Here and each time except the first has been HORRIBLE!!! I LITERALLY JUST LOOKED AT MY FOOD FOR 10 MINUTES until I said excuse me is that my order.  Oh ya he said and walked away and no one gave it to me. I had to raise my voice  a bit.  The chubby guy at the register did not help nor handle anything. The young guy who just clocked out was standing in front of the register and just stood there and watched me as well. Like OMG are you serious. And the man after I rose my voice finally started to give me my food and I said this food is now old as we ordered 25 minutes prior before their hey her food is on the counter revelation moment.  \n\nI say the good is cold the egg rolls need to be replaced and the guy just looked at me looked at the bags looked at me and then started to replace the egg rolls. \n\nNow I am sitting at my desk my sandwich tastes disgusting the meat tastes old like its from days ago.  It sucks compared to the one on Spring Mountain and they all suck compared to the ones in California.
2741	1	a	I have had the opportunity to work with Eitan on a couple of transactions (I am a realtor) and he has come through both times and my clients loved him.  I have had more rough experiences with loan officers then I care to remember so its GREAT when you meet a good one!  Keep up the good work Eitan and I'm sure we will do more business in the future!
2742	0	a	Slow....\nWell they did just open so maybe the staff is fres, er, new too.\nOur order - Venti Hot Chai Tea Latte and a Grande Iced Mocha.  Chai didn't take too long but the  Mocha was finally served after the Chai,  two drive through customers and two or three customers ordering inside the store.\nHmmm.\nNice if they could get both out at the same time.\nAtmosphere is roomy, open and dark.  I think it is really nice and appealing.  Maybe the expansive size of this location will mean quicker drive thru service.  Maybe, eventually, it will pick up inside too.  \nI foresee it will soon become the hangout for students from Corona and the nearby schools.  Good for business, sure, but I just get the impression that it will soon resemble the malls. \nI'll probably keep with the other location North of here.
2743	1	a	Delightful place. Delightful location. Delightful people. Lizzy and Trevor are colorful, engaging, and attentive - not only in their customer service but in the selection of their shop goods. I walked out with a bag full of goodies and gadgets that I've never seen elsewhere: Big red magic ball, iridescent bubble spinners, and sushi decor for my little man's Kindle.  The Willy Wonka of toys. Something for everyone. This place is a unicorn!
2744	1	a	The Container Parks very own toy box.  Just look for the vibrant colorful storefront with a non martial arts mutant turtle towards the back.  The lively mix of nostalgic and inventive toys are perfect for wee tots like my 2 boys or the wee tot in you.  Retro action figures and Japanese doodads abound.  It's basically a veritable Pee Wee's playhouse in there.  The selection is innocent and wholesome.  I can imagine the legions of computer desk knick-knacks and paddy-whacks adorning the Zappos office from here.\n\nThe selection is complete chaos in order.  Randomness in sections.  From toys for toes & kiddie tattoos to Mario Bro's & Dr. Who's.  You will be entertained browsing through the shop.  It's a very feel good toy store where you would actually want your kids to pick from.  I can't help but think of Harajuku clashed with hipster then exploded into bits and pieces and landed perfectly onto shelves and stacked neatly to become Kappa Toys toy store.\n\nNo matter how thick or thin your wallet is you will find something special here.  Although some larger things may be a bit overpriced, there are even bins of interesting little quarter machine toys that you might remember from way back when quarter machines only costed a quarter.  Please take me back to my childhood?!  Impossible.  Well then take me to Kappa Toys instead!   :)
2745	1	a	Broadway finally meets Vegas! A must see show!!! Sexy burlesque dancers, an amazing talented singer and a broadway male lead performer!! A must see show!!!
2746	1	a	The sopapillas were awesome! I tried their fish, shrimp, and pollo asado tacos, as well. The fish taco was ok. The chicken taco was a little dry and tough. But the shrimp taco hit the spot. Great cream sauce with a bit of a kick, too! It's local. It's tasty. It's decently priced. You should check it out.
2747	0	a	I wanted to love this place so much. It's around the corner from my place and was super excited to hear of its opening. Went in today right at 5. It was hard to miss all of the employees in the restaurant,  and equally hard to miss how messy the salsa bar and drink station were. Surely one of the employees could wipe the counters?  The best thing I ordered was a side of beans. Beans. My turkey mole taco was ok. But the pastor taco had no flavor. Both tacos needed salt. I'm so sad that the food wasn't better. Not sure if I will try again.
2748	1	a	How I love me some street tacos! And Mucho Macho Tacos sure does have them! We came here for lunch on a Friday afternoon after hearing that it had recently opened. I've been to Tacos Atoyac before so I was excited about this place opening seeing Atoyac closed. \n\nMucho Macho is definitely a lot cleaner than Atoyac. It also seams to have more tables inside but there isn't a patio like the old location. I can see when It gets busy finding room might be tough but lucky for us we were able to find seating right away. \n\nWe ordered a few different tacos and a carne quesadilla. I'm a huge fan of street tacos and all of there were really good. We ordered the crispy fish tacos, pastor, and carne. I loved the pastor taco so much! Next time I think I'll just order a bunch of them! Carne was. A close second and I did enjoy the fish but I'd probably stick to pastor and carne next time. I enjoyed the quesadilla but my wife actually thought the meat was a little tough. \n\nOverall I had a great experience. For 4 tacos and a quesadilla total was right around $15 for the both of us. We had a lot of food and paired with chips and great salas you really couldn't beat the prices.  I'll forsure be back!
2749	1	a	It's dangerous living near by...\nLove the friendly staff, they make you laugh. The comfortable atmosphere. \nAnd most of all the creative & well prepared tacos!!
2750	0	a	The staff is very friendly.  The tacos are extremely small, and over priced.  About one dollar per bite.  The owners previous restaurant served the same product for less than half the price.  Food quality is  very average.
2751	1	a	Most amazing Horchata ever.  Plus, the pastor and braised brisket tacos are amazingly unique like none other.  I highly recommend this new, hip, reasonably priced taco joint.
2752	1	a	A friend of mine turned me on to Tacos Atoyac...and one day we forgot it was closed on Mondays, so we went here to the Tacos Atoyac Alumni joint...its every bit as good if not better.  If you want a fish taco like no other...this would be the place to go.  Not kidding.  This is a small place.  Mucho Macho tacos uses the freshest ingredients skillfully and delivers big flavors.  Check out the special salsa in the refrigerator below the salsa bar...totally worth it.  Its almost like the secret stash.  Don't miss this place but get there early, its an old, Circle K location that features 3 tenants and it isn't 'long' on parking spaces.
2753	1	a	I've driven by this place quite a few times while on 7th ave and decided to give it a try today after my hike. I ordered the 'Surfer' torta and my friend had the steak and shrimp tacos. I have to say that everything was delicious.  The torta was definitely tasty. And the service was just as good. I've found a new taco spot and I'll definitely be hitting it up again soon.
2754	1	a	We were so excited to have the guy from Tacos Atoyac open a restaurant in a location that is more convenient to us. The fish tacos and burritos are of course amazing. My husband who supposedly doesn't like fish tacos even thinks they are good. I also like anything with the chorizo, and the Pastor is very tasty. We have only gotten take out so far, but it has been fast and affordable.
2755	0	a	"Mucho Macho Taco - so the Macho comes from using 5\"" tortillas instead of 3\"" for their street tacos. Personally I think they should have spent more time making food with Mucho flavor instead of worrying about tortilla sizes. Mucho lacking here at Mucho Macho Taco. I went for lunch and after looking at the menu went with the brisket burrito, with green chillies, carmelized  onions and oranges.... Uh no oranges please. The green chillies were not New Mexico Hatch green chillies but instead food distributor canned green chillies. Carmelized onions, diced and slightly cooked does not equal carmelized. While the brisket was decent I am quite doubtful it was slow cooked out back for 10 hours- most likely off the Shamrock or Sysco truck as well. \nWhile there is a salsa bar at Mucho Macho I did not care for any of the salsa options. The \""hot\"" salsa which kind of looks like roasted salsa is nothing more than red pepper flakes and oil. Funny, I never use oil when making salsa. The mild was simply blended canned tomatoes and lacked flavor, the green which I am guessing was supposed to be an avocado whipped salsa had decent texture but also lacked flavor. There was no pico salsa available - WTH?? \nSo in closing, the location is clean, simple decor, and the guys are nice but I will not be going back here at anytime as it significantly falls short of hundreds of other Mexican restaurants in the valley."
2756	1	a	I really loved this tiny little taco shop. The salsa was among the best and freshest I have ever had! I enjoyed their fish tacos and the price was a huge surprise. The tacos were full of fresh delicious ingredients and you could add additional items at the salsa bar. Come here hungry, BYOB and you will leave with change in your pocket. They have a briskly take out business too. I only wish they had a location in North Phoenix, I should buy a franchise....
2757	1	a	This place is 10x better than jamba juice, this specific location is better than the one of the strip, smoothies taste better and are alot faster. This is my #1 smoothie place, cant live without it.
2758	1	a	I have been to this location 3 times, and the service was fast/employees were polite, the food was good, & the atmosphere was clean &  beach inspired. I like Tropical Smoothie b/c it has relatively healthy options served fast & it is reasonably affordable.
2759	0	a	Too many excuses for not being prepared.  \nWhile understanding their move and supporting the store from South Blvd to Plaza Midwood, they just don't have it together.  HHM is extremely overpriced IMO.  Those necessary bulk items (not packaged), they did not make the space for, i.e., Raw Cacao.  Also, every time I'm checking out, the cashiers continually have personal conversations with each other while serving the customer.  Sorry if I feel the need to interrupt the conversation to inquire about store products.  Lastly, I asked for a manager for assistance and just found out from another store - she wasn't the manager.  I'm not impressed with HHM any longer.
2760	0	a	"Unhappy! Went to get juice after yoga and it was a disaster. Person making two of the same juices at once made 1.5 cups worth and never stirred so first person got top half of juice and I got second. When they went to refill mine, machine was \""broken\"" so I paid $8 for half a smoothie. Offered to take two dollars off but when they realized they already rang me up, they just stared at me until I left. Terrible customer service this early in the game. Will not being going back if I can help it."
2761	1	a	Excellent service as usual! I stopped in during rush hour to speak with one of their vitamin experts. For less than the price of my GP's co-pay I was referred to a great cleanse and a high quality probiotic that really helped with the stomach problems I have been having! And the falafel from the deli just melted my mouth. So excited about this new location- am expecting great things as they settle into the new neighborhood! Will miss the South Blvd. store for the rest of my life but the new location at Plaza  has given HHM an opportunity to step up their game. I suspect the other reviews here with lower ratings are one-offs from the opening pains. No one is perfect 100% of the time but HHM has heart and soul and is LOCAL - support our Charlotte businesses!
2762	1	a	Had a great time at the opening of Rick Bronson's House of Comedy on 9/11. First, the place is gorgeous, it fits in perfectly with the upscale atmosphere you'll find on High Street in City North, making it the perfect addition to a date night or GNO. The bar area is beautifully lit and the bartender was extremely friendly and jovial - just what you'd expect from a bar in a comedy club. The interior is also gorgeous, it's dark and has nice lighting, including several large flatscreens behind the stage. The show was hilarious, Rick Bronson who was there for the opening did a great job of warming up the crowd, and we were literally crying we were laughing so hard when Tony Gaud and Harland Williams took the stage. My only criticism would be the table service - we ordered the hummus flatbread which was just sort of uninspired. It was a flatbread with some hummus, a few sprinkles of goat cheese and slices of radishes. The prices were about what you'd expect for this type of entertainment in this neighborhood, but we were a little surprised at the $17 drinks (double jack and cokes). Other than that we had an amazing time It and we definitely feel forgiving of any hiccups since it was opening night. I highly recommend trying it out, we will be back!
2763	1	a	Great new edition to the comedy clubs in Phoenix.  The food was good. The club was nicely decorated.  I was disappointed that they did not have any beer on tap. I will definitely visit again.
2764	1	a	OMG. We spent New Year's Eve here last and it was the best decision we have made for celebrating.  The place was great, the acts were amazing, and the owner was the best host. We will be back.
2765	0	a	Should be called House of Idiots. Terrible Venue & incompetent staff. We were here New years eve for the 7:00 show.\nWhen we walked in, there was no one there to greet us. The tickets said no reserved seating, so we were not sure if we were to seat ourselves. We walked inside and the only help we saw were bringing drinks to tables. We we walked back into the lobby we finally saw some employees taking tickets and seating people. The whole thing looked so unorganized I was waiting for the clowns to appear. \n\nThe place is extremely cramped. I know that a place like this wants to maximize the seating capacity, but this was ridiculous. Since this was a brand new place, they should have done some better planning. \n\nThe tickets said that the doors open at 6:30, but when we got there at 6:15 the place was already half full. Had we know that we would have arrived sooner to get a better table.\n\nWe ordered two beers from a server who looked about 18 years old who brought us the beers with no glasses. When I asked for the glasses, he said he would bring them when he came back. He then proceeded to take the orders from about 4 other tables. After about 15 minutes, we were still waiting so I got up and walked out to the lobby where the bar was, and the bar was completely dark with no one working there. Finally an employee saw me looking around and asked me if she could help me, and I told her our server never brought us any glasses. She then went behind the bar and got the glasses. Even after I went back to the table we didn't see our server for another half hour and he didn't even remember that he was supposed to bring us glasses.\n\nI had called ahead to verify the actual time the show started and was told 7:00. Not true. The show didn't start until 7:25 and ended at 8:45. An hour and 20 minutes total for 3 comedians. \n\nThe headliner only was on for about 40 minutes. The other 2 comedians took up the rest of the time. \n\nOn top of all this, when I looked at my receipt for our drinks the next day, we were given the wrong bill. Now I have to straighten out that mess. Our bill was $18 and my card was charged $75. I'm sure the other person that got my charge of $18 is not saying a thing.  Worst comedy club ever! We won't be back.
2766	1	a	I am so glad I found Izzy.  I have used his services for my business law questions and contracts a number of times.  He calls back right away, is straight forward, extremely knowledgeable, easy to talk to.  As little knowledge as I may have about any issue, he listens, takes the time, and gives sound legal advice I can count on.  Thanks Izzy for all you do!
2767	1	a	New vegan restaurant opened just south of Ste Cat, on Bishop--it's been open about a week and I've had 6 different people on Yelp and Facebook ask me about it... So here's the review.\n\nThe first thing that struck me was the menu - its gorgeous, full colour with excellent photography, but...entirely in French. This wasn't a huge problem for me, but in Montreal this is a big no-no, especially downtown and next to Concordia.\n\nI decided on the sweet potato and black bean burger on kamut, with tofu bacon and daiya swiss. I got their fries instead of a salad and a Zevia ginger root beer.\n\nFirst impression, the fries were amazing. I'm usually a reach for the condiments guy, but these were so well seasoned they didn't need anything.\n\nThe burger had good flavour, but a couple of technical problems - the bun, being kamut, was a lot more firm than the patty. Physics played its part, but the end result was a the patty spreading beyond the bun each bite.\n\nIf they can find a way to firm it up I'd definitely try it again.\n\nThe tofu bacon was a bit disappointing, and mislabeled. Its smoked tofu, which is fine, but a very different texture than I'd expect from something labeled bacon.\n\nI didn't notice the daiya til the very end of the meal, I wouldn't spend the extra .90 for it again.\n\nThe whole meal came to just under $16, which is way more than I'd be willing to spend on a burger and fries on a regular basis, but they are new and experimenting with their menu (which I imagine includes their prices) I worry that the area they're in will buck at the idea of a $16 lunch.\n\nI don't recommend the Zevia sodas, they're flavoured with stevia and its call I could taste.\n\nAfter my meal I got to try one of their two deserts, and opted for the brownie. My brownie standards are quite high as there are some fantastic brownie destinations in Montreal. I'd rate theirs a solid 8. Possible ways it could improve? Serving it warm, or with some sort of custard or coulis. I'd ditch the quinoa sprinkled on top too - I could easily see it being a 9 or 10 then.\n\nI also tried their quinoa chili, the kale was a great addition, but it lacked enough sweetness for me. If you like spicy chilli, you won't be disappointed.\n\nI'll definitely be back to try them again.
2768	1	a	The restaurant is pretty okay, considering it's vegan and almost all options on the menu come gluten free (for a celiac, this is amazing!)  I was sort of unimpressed with the portobello mushroom burger as keeping it in the bun was pretty much impossible -- it ended up all over my hands and I ended up having to eat it with a fork.  Maybe not the best design.  My boyfriend had a bowl and it looked pretty alright.  I also want to add that while I'm no garlic fascist, your bean dip gave me the worst breathe imaginable.  I don't know how you managed to put that much garlic in there, but coming from a garlic lover you need to tone it down a little.\n\nEither way, this place has some kinks it needs to work out, but it'll get there.  I'm proud to say we've got a vegan fast food joint in Montreal.
2769	0	a	They gave me a costumers wrong order(Which was my correct order). Normally I wouldn't care but they came from outside the location.  I have no idea what could've been done to it before hand!
2770	1	a	Waou! Quel superbe endroit. \u00c9tant une fervente amatrice de bi\u00e8res de micro-brasserie, j'attendais depuis plusieurs semaines l'ouverture de ce bar dans mon quartier. \n\nQuelques coches plus \u00e9l\u00e9gant que le Vices et Versa, mais avec une liste de bi\u00e8res tout aussi impressionnante (et m\u00eame une stout en cask, lorsque j'y ai fait mon tour), l'endroit \u00e9pate. La d\u00e9co est vraiment belle, et l'endroit est relativement spacieux. 24 f\u00fbts, dont quelques-uns brass\u00e9s par les propri\u00e9taires, des bi\u00e8res en bouteilles provenant du Danemark, de la Belgique et du Qu\u00e9bec, du vin, du scotch, et plusieurs autres types d'alcool; c'est s\u00fbr que vous y trouverez votre compte. Le menu, bien que succinct, m'a vraiment tent\u00e9e, et j'ai h\u00e2te d'y retourner pour y go\u00fbter! Les prix sont plus que corrects, 7,25$ pour une pinte et entre 10 et 16$ pour un plat. \n\nLe service \u00e9tait un peu lent, mais \u00e7a ne faisait qu'une journ\u00e9e que le bar \u00e9tait officiellement ouvert lorsque j'ai \u00e9t\u00e9, donc je n'en tiens pas rigueur. Les serveurs \u00e9taient super courtois et connaissaient leurs produits. \n\nBref. Endroit que je recommande chaudement! Go Rosemont, t'es hot!
2771	1	a	A new beer bar? I'll be there. I tried to belly up to this bar on Friday and there was a line (an actual line! On Beaubien!) and when I'm looking for a casual beer and hang with a beloved buddy I don't do lines, so I skipped it; but slipped in no sweat on the next sunny Sunday afternoon and this time was not disappointed. A very relaxed, good looking set of rooms, nice dim warm lighting, a feeling of metallic and wood, and a long bar with sleek matching taps. You order from a beer menu with over 20 local choices, including a few nice finds and homemade beers you won't find on other lists in the city. The staff was friendly, calm and helpful and the big windows and two big rooms and long central shared standing table all lure me back for winter drinking. I suspect the buzz will mellow and the lineups will dissipate into a generally popular bar, and I'll be there.
2772	1	a	"Isle de garde entered my list of new bars I needed to visit urgently as soon I read the review from Karine S. Expectations have been set high and satisfied well by the extensive choice of local beers. We, the \""old\"" people, arrived around 7pm on Saturday and the bar was already packed, but we managed to get our own spot of counter type in the second room. Later during the night when the \""young\"" population of Montreal infiltrated the bar, people would be just standing up and drinking. The bar offers also nice list of food options. I had the marinated pork tongue, served in a jar with toasted baguette and mustard, delicious snack for good brew. Service is great. The guys handled very professionally the concern that the second pint of the smoky PunkRaugh lager didn't taste the same, may be they did a mistake when I just ordered \""the same\"" or they just changed the keg, but they brought immediately a small tasting glass and substituted the pint in question. Besides that I enjoyed the floor in the bathrooms, which is of numismatic value. Ultimately, I'm happy to see another bar, where I can explore the amazing Quebec beers!"
2773	1	a	Bonne s\u00e9lection de bi\u00e8re. Ambiance d\u00e9contract\u00e9e. La cuisine est capable d'envoyer plats une ou deux coches au-dessus du regular pub fare. Rapport qualit\u00e9 prix bien correct. C'est franchement bruyant, par contre. Au point d'\u00eatre parfois inconfortable.
2774	1	a	Updating because of a few important things I didn't know about on my first visits: like many of my favourite bars and restaurants in this city there are no televisions. As someone who didn't grow up with one I find the flickering allure of the screen impossible to look away from and for me it's a conversation killer. BUT, the other half of the classically genius Quebec equation is this: a TV, or in this case a projector and big screen, materializes when the Habs play. Isle de Garde play the game without sound so it doesn't take over, but you can keep up with everybody's favourite Canadiens. \n\nAlso: they have a sandwich that is mac and cheese inside a grilled cheese. \n\nThose are my important updates.

2776	0	a	Ok seriously these people are annoying. The act like they are from the las vegas visitors bureau but they are TIMESHARE reps. Ok sure I got two tickets for peepshow and two spice market buffet ticks for dirt cheap but the presentation for 2 hours was NOT worth my time. First Carol who was our rep was annoying. She would ask me questions like how much do I think a hotel room is on average a night- well in Vegas right now about $50. She said that's not realistic more like $150 (um not sure where in Vegas she is talking about, we paid under $80 a night for THE HOTEL at mandalay bay). Basically, a person would be looking at $5,000 a year for a week of vacation. Pretty damn insane and I wasn't impressed at all. She called me out and was like you are here for the gifts aren't you. I looked at her and said YES I AM. They offered them and I wanted them and I sat through the crap. Once we said no she didn't say two words to us. Really unprofessional and the show and buffet were sub par. Seriously don't waste your time. Buy the tickets outright and save yourself some time.
2777	0	a	In 2008, my husband and i visited the model condo.  We decided to get the three nights stay.  We thought the condos were too modern for us.  When we arrived in April 2010 to use our three nigh stay, we were greeted by an overbearing salesperson who identified himself as a concierge.  He constandly stated that he needed to sign paper regarding our lease.  What lease??  We only bought a three night stay.  We were harassed and victimized by him.  He tried to show us a 4 bedroom condo.  We told him many times before that we were interested in purchasing anything.  Finally, paper work  to sign...................It was only a comment sheet.  We were appalled that he told at least 3 hours of our vacation time.  I wrote a complain letter to his supervisor and other managers.  We didn't have anything from them. Our experience at Westgate Las Vegas was awful.  Will never stay there again.
2778	0	a	"Westgate, I hate you!\n\nWish I felt better after writing that but alas, I don't. \nI had purchased a 2 night package for Planet Hollywood.  For $200 we were going to get $50 of chips and 2 nights.  We had to attend a 90 minute presentation.  Fine, I can do that for a nice weekend room at the PH.\n\nWhen my plans fell through I was told I wasn't going to get my money back (I knew that) and that I had until April 2011 to use the hotel (1 yr from date of purchase).  I made reservations in Nov for the MLK weekend in Jan.  \n\nI called to confirm my MLK plans and was told that Westgate no longer does business with PH and instead they can offer us Westgate Flamingo.  2.5 miles away from the strip? Are you kidding me? The manager quoted me that the contract says that they can change locations as they see fit.  To a comparable place, one would hope!  When I asked for my money back I was told that that's also a \""no can do.\"" \n\nSo I am a week from heading to Vegas and I have some interesting things that I'll be doing: staying NOWHERE near my original plans (and where our friends are staying), fighting with my credit card to dispute a transaction and paying a helluva fee to stay at another hotel. \n\nThank you for ruining my weekend, a$$holes."
2779	0	a	Hubby and I got suckered into a presentation for thei Westgate Vacation Club while on vacation in Las Vegas last week.  We got free dinner and a show for our 2hours of time.  \n\nAll in all the presentation was good, the condo units seem pretty nice, and the idea is a great one for people who want to travel more.  \n\nHowever we do not make any snap decisions and told the sales people that, well you would have thought the world was ending....all of a sudden the higher up sales person accuses us of not being truthful with them, of not making sense since we want to go on more vacations and wanting to spend more time with family....why would we not want to buy into their vacation club....we had to suffer through 2 other sales people and say NO like 10 times before they would let us leave.   \n\nIt was more stressful that it should have been....and after being treated that way will never buy anything from Westgate Resorts...  You just don't treat people like that.
2780	0	a	"I'm a cardiac anesthesiologist, and my wife and I like getting free stuff.  So when we passed by PH and were offered 3day/2night hotel, a $50 visa debit card, 2 sets of tickets to mediocre shows which we did not attend (I wasn't interested), we decided to listen to their 90 min presentation.\n\nI was prepared for high pressure sales tactics.  Since we did not buy the timeshare, this is a review of their pressured attempts to sell us.\n\nFirst, they walked us across the street to a place and then realized it was not the right resort.  We waited for 15-20min for a van to take us to the right place.\n\nWhen we arrived, they we're all nice.  They brought me coffee while we waited for our sales rep, and then once he was ready, we had access to OJ, coffee (just okay), oatmeal, danishes, muffins, etc. for breakfast.\n\nOur sales rep, Edgar, was a small mexican guy who was really rude.  He kept saying that we couldn't afford what he was offering and for us to just take the free gifts.  This might've been a little of my fault since I told him I only made $60k / yr, but once I told him the truth, he still used the same \""you can't afford this, prove me wrong\"" sales technique.  He did know I was an anesthesiologist up front however, so maybe he just didn't believe my initial $60k annual salary - and just continued with his \""prove me wrong\"" condescending sales technique.\n\nThe other sales technique he used was \""impending event.\""  In other words, we had to buy now (of course) to take advantage of no credit check and being able to use other companies timeshares for $20-30 extra / week if they didn't have a Westgate resorts timeshare available in the area you wanted to vacation in.\n\nTo be perfectly honest, Edgar was such a fast talker that I didn't understand all the benefits of being an owner.  He kept skipping out on many important facts like \""in what other cities are the timeshares located?\"" and also \""what is the maintenance fee?\"" despite asking him several times.\n\nThey have something to say for every response you can give them.  One thing that was a huge red flag for me was that they didn't let me use my phone to look up reviews and that they didn't want me to call back tomorrow after looking up the reviews.  I was honestly interested in buying, but it was just not possible to call back later to buy after looking up the reviews.  I don't even like watching movies before looking at reviews!\n\nAfter a prolonged presentation and even though we could've easily afforded buying the 2-bed condo in cash (I think it was about $40k total), I basically had to say \""I cannot afford it\"" for them to let us go and get our gifts (and they were condescending about it).  Then two more people came by and offered us lowered prices and special payment plans, but we basically had to say \""sorry we can't afford it.\""\n\nFinally, we were allowed to leave and received our gifts as promised.  The whole experience took about 3 hours.\n\nI don't think Edgar is normally a rude, condescending guy, but I really do think that this was his sales style using the sales technique \""prove-me-wrong-that-you-can-afford-this,\"" as well as the technique of \""impending event,\"" and finally of course \""reciprocity\"" (by giving us the free gifts and thus feeling obligated).  There are probably several other sales techniques that were used and that I'm not remembering (gimme a break, I'm a physician and we do not study marketing in school!), but those are the main ones that come to mind.  I guess the sales technique of lowering the initial price to something significantly better is another technique that was used.\n\nAfter reading these reviews here, I'm SO GLAD I did NOT buy from them!\n\nI actually feel a little sorry for Edgar and the rest of the sales people.  Their act of preying upon susceptible people and force selling sets up a large amount of negative karma for the sales people, and it isn't a very respectable job by any means."

2782	0	a	"Buying a Westgate timeshare was the biggest mistake I've ever made. Every other bad choice in my life has at least ended up leading me somewhere better or helped me to become a better person down the road, but not the timeshare. This bad decision sucked a ton of money out of me and continues to do so for maintenance and taxes every year, and I haven't gotten ANYTHING out of it except for years worth of scam artists cold-calling me to get MORE money out of me to supposedly sell it - a scam that probably works a lot with Westgate owners because having this $#@! timeshare is such a MISERABLE experience. EVERY time I have tried to use my timeshare, there has been something new pop out of the woodwork. \""Oh sorry, that resort will be an extra $1000 fee because it's ski season.\"" \""Oh sorry, that resort, and that one, and that one, and yes, those other ones, are all full.\"" \""Oh sorry, there's a new rule at Planet Hollywood now where you have to bank your week by September 30th of the previous year or it's gone until 2014. Yes, we know that Westgate used to allow you to use it in off-years, but we're Hilton now. Tough luck.\"" \n\nWe were promised easy booking, plenty of availability, lots of choices for resorts, a big grand opening party when PH opened... nothing. I've had none of that. The timeshare presentation was smoke and mirrors, and now I own a worthless so-called \""vacation\"" package I have not been able to actually use ONCE in 4 years. And I've been paying over $650 in taxes every year for the privilege of NOT actually going on vacation.\n\nDO NOT DO NOT DO NOT let these scam artists suck you in. If only I had read reviews before signing that paper. If only."

This was after:\n1.   They told me they had no rooms that would accommodate my reservation ( I had two disabled senior citizens in my group)\n2. I was sent to a room that was already occupied\n3. Finally placed in another room and THEN received call from front desk stating I was in the wrong room\n4. Conversations with numerous staff members (none that were communicating with each other).  \n\nAfter complaining to the \""manager\"" my compensation was that I could receive complimentary Wi-Fi (which I had been told was free).  Funny thing is - no Wi-Fi, even after calling the front desk AGAIN (where they told me they would charge me...hmmm Free??)...Ultimately never received Wi-Fi connection.  \n\nI would recommend that no one ever stay at this resort as their customer service is a negative 0!  \n\nPS:  The room was not as pictured online, very old & musty with a cover up of bleach smelling."

2786	0	a	Westgate resorts are full of shit, nothing but rob people for money and get the big guy even richer! Worst experience we ever had , when they tried to get me and my wife to buy timeshare, forcing us , just to get our Disney tickets they promised for half price , after this experience I really should of bought the tickets full price. Thanks God we ranned out of their waiting area right when they wanted us to sign the contract!! Thank you God , that we got away from these people!! Don't be fooled ! Look at people's reviews from experience . Don't Waiste your time , money ! No no no you will regret it believe me! Wow just to see other review , it sucks people got screwed!! Hope fully they go out of business and stop robbing people!

She was laying to us and Being rude. The rooms are noisy. I don't come back here ever!!!!!!!!!
2788	0	a	I was very disappointed with my experience with Westgate  Resorts.  I was approached in the mall by a representative who offered tickets to a show for $20.00 if I would go to listen to a 90 min presentation.  I went and ended up spending 3 hours.  The offer looked interesting and I told them I wanted a day to research before I made my final decision.  They told me that I could do that but they would hold on to my tickets and to call the next day to arrange pick up.  I called my representative twice and left a message.  Cody never returned my call and I never received a call back or my tickets.  So I ended up losing $20.00 and 3 hours.  \n\nWhat's more concerning is that in the presentation I was told that my personal representative would be there to help me once I signed up.  Based on the fact I had called and left messages with no returned call only makes me wonder what the service would be like if I actually signed up.  The business card I received was also for a different company, so it also makes me wonder how committed the representative is to his job.  With all of the promises it just sounds too good to be true.  \n\nIf you do decide to take advantage of the offer, here are some tips.\n\nWhen asked:\nHow often you go to Vegas, say once every couple of years\nHow many vacations you go on in a year, keep it low\nHow much you spend per trip, keep it low\n\nThe questions are ammunition to convince you their program is a good deal.  If you resist and tell them it is out of your budget they will likely offer you a foreclosure for nearly half the original cost.\n\nThis whole experience has put such a bad taste in my mouth I will never go to a presentation again.
2789	0	a	People,\n\nIt's so plane and simple.  If you're an idiot and you don't care about where you waste your money and you want to be treated like trash then by all means go give your money to these losers, like so many dumb people have. \n\nBut, if you value your family, time, and money, stay away from this disgusting company and their putrid sales staff.
2790	0	a	"I wouldn't even give this one star but no star isn't an option. You get approached by them asking, \""would you like great deals on shows or dinner?\""- that's their sales pitch, right? But of course you know it's about a time share. And you tell them you're not interested but the person presenting you your deals about discounted show tickets and dinner is extremely friendly - \""Just compare your hotel to our resort, only a 90 min presentation. You get a nice lunch (not- old subs sitting there the whole day and a bag of chips) and we'll hook you up with all these shows or a dinner and $100\"". \n\nWe made the biggest mistake and gave in!!\n\nYou get set up with a sales person, ours was Samuel and he was friendly in the beginning but you tell them you're not interested and he became extremely rude. I regret not reporting him to a manager or someone above him about the way he treated us after we said no to signing up for a timeshare. \n\nAfter saying no repeatedly, he told us \""well you're not going to find anything for $1, you only came here for show tickets\"", as if we were even interested in a timeshare in Vegas in the first place! And yes we were there for discounted show tickets! Your initial sales pitch to getting anyone to listen to your presentation on your timeshare resort are discounted tickets to shows! Why is this a shock?!\nBuying a timeshare  is not a decision you make over a 3 hr presentation! Yes, they will keep you way over 90min.\n\nIt pretty much ruined our day just because they treat you like shit when you don't sign up for a timeshare. They were so rude - even a manager said \""ugh, just give them their tickets and get them out of here\"".\n\nResort was nice but just based on how we were treated, I wouldn't recommend anyone to westgate resort- at least not getting suckered into this situation like we were."
2791	0	a	I have thought that maybe my post will be useful to those who have bought or thinking of buying.It has been said a lot of negative things about  Westgates,and I am not going there,They all are true.Period. But you can get out if you act fast. We got into it too (stupid,but people act stupid in Vegas :),but thanks to your guys posts,we desperately wanted out.And we acted fast. According to NV law,you have FIVE days to reject a time-share property you purchased,and it has to be in writing.We sent overnight letter to the showroom in Vegas,to their headquarter in FL,to the resort itself and to the title company.Just in case.We got out and got our deposit back. Our son is still mocking at us that we really went Vegas.lol. There are also ways to get out after five days,but they are more complex. If you got yourself into this trap,research NV time-share law and act. Hope my post will prevent somebody from buying into it or help get out in time.
2792	0	a	"The wife and I did a Westgate timeshare presentation in Branson MO. We were going to do it at The Woods, but then were \""upgraded\"" to their Emerald Pointe location. The salesman said were swapping a woods view for a lake view. Turns out we traded a woods view for a view of the parking lot and garbage cans with thin walls so we could clearly hear the screaming kids in the lake view room next door. When we asked for another room we were told the lake view rooms were for owners. The timeshare presentation was supposed to be 90 min but as usual lasted 2.5 hrs, even though I expedited the close because we were used to the tactics. The first offer was 50 grand for one week in two bedroom, which can be split into two weeks if you split it with one week of one bedroom lake view and with view of the parking lot. I told our salesperson that was exorbitant and to bring on \""the manager who is just going to review everything\"" second offer. As is typical, she offered a biannual week for 11 grand, then nine grand as last offer. Thankfully, there was not another manager to review everything was done correctly and then offer yet another offer as is customary with other timeshare companies. Overall not too pushy for timeshare salespeople but wholly crap, Westgate really values their garbage can view properties. I told them we would think about after researching online which I wasn't able to do since Westgate doesn't offer free wifi. I then asked when we would be eligible for for another timeshare presentation so we could stay another two nights for $99."

The hotel staff (which is otherwise cool) has been trained by this corporation to prey on ignorant vacationers in a very sleazy and manipulative way. They're like pushy car salesmen, but ten times worse. Very disrespectful and don't take NO for an answer. Left a bad taste in my mouth and certainly won't be returning to the LVH because of this. Gross.

Plus the place is a dump and they are looking for suckers to pay $69,000 for a one week a year time share so they can use your money to fix it up. You will leave angry, guaranteed!

Then it was 1015 but they said to arrive at 930 so now it went from 1.5 hours to 2.25 hours!  We started to doubt all of this and the guy started flailing his arms all over and making sounds of disappointment.  We stuck around and finished the paper work, gave the 40 dollar deposit and left.  Walked back 5 minutes later to cancel after looking them up on yelp and yes,  you guessed it, the dude acted like the world ended. Then we tried to get our papers back and they said no. My girl grabbed them off the counter and tore them up and walked away. Stay away from these people complete A holes!!!!
2797	0	a	This hotel, in its 3 rd life, now as the Westgate, is tired. The hot water handle came off in my hand. There's mold on the wallpaper in my bathroom. It's a throwback, but not in a nostalgic way. \n\nOn a positive note the staff is friendly sand there are lots of people there to help you. Let's hope the new owner pumps money into updating the facilities.
2798	0	a	"I didn't realize that Westgate had just bought LVH. This was our first time staying here (call it the Westgate or the LVH) It's really hard to believe this is under new management.... Apparently we stayed on the 'renovated' 23rd floor, but I began to wonder as we walked down to our room, as the hallways were clearly old, smelly, with falling apart baseboards, and old wall paper..The room was not much better. I think it would better if I just enumerate the problems we encountered. \n\n1. When checking in, the lady at the front desk asked us if we wanted a king bed, we said, 'yes.' She said that she upgraded our room for us. We said 'Thank you' (incidentally, it was the lady's last day, so we thought maybe that's why she upgraded us, or maybe that's what all hotels say in Vegas??)\n\n2. We get to the room, which, yes was huge (hence 'upgraded\"") we look over to our 'king' size bed, to find that it was, in fact, a MURPHY BED in a double size. I would have called to complain but we literally had to run out the door as soon as we got there to pick up my parents from the airport. (Anyways, why would such a huge room need a Murphy bed??)\n\n3. When it was finally time for bed, I pull down the sheets to find a stain... was it blood? was it rust? I didn't care. I can't sleep in a bed with stains. Especially not in Vegas!\n\n4. When I called to have the sheets changed, it took housekeeping a full hour to come to our room, which was at 1am when they finally came. The housekeepers were actually quite nice. They went through three sets of sheets to find us one that didn't have stains on it. (and it was actually them who kept changing the sheets, not us requesting!)\n\n5. The overall cleanliness of the room was terrible. Besides the sheet problem, there were stains on the lampshade on the desk. Their were stains on the carpet. There were stains on the wall. There were even two dirty handprints on the ceiling (!!???) The shower was disgusting, the tile floor had grime in the grout, I actually showered with my flip flops on. \n\n6. One of the circuits blew in our room, taking out two lamps and the fridge and a few outlets. very odd. \n\n7. The resort fee is $20 a day (it used to be $18 something when it was LVH, which they honored for us, since we booked our hotel when it was still LVH, which was nice) I don't really know what the resort fee is for, considering you can only have one device connected to the internet per day, and you have to renew that connection everyday. \n\n8. We requested, as well as my parents, to get a room somewhat close to each other. They gave us each a room on the 23rd floor, on the COMPLETE OPPOSITE END of the floor... it was seriously a quarter mile walk in between our rooms! ridiculous. On top of that, the hallway STANK walking through it. \n\nI'm sorry, but this was not a pleasant stay for us. I don't like writing negative reviews, but I felt this was necessary. I really cannot foresee us ever staying here again."
2799	0	a	This is by far the worst hotel I've ever stayed in. If I could give it less than one star I would. I booked 5 nights through a travel agent and upon check in they told me they only have me down for 4 nights. I showed them my booking and receipt and they said they would honor it. Upon check out I saw they still charged me for the 5th night even though they were NOT supposed to and said it had been taken care of. I went to the front desk and they told me it was a mistake and that they would refund the money. I took the receipt for the refund and thought that was the end of it. When I checked my statement I saw they had NOT refunded the money. They just gave me a receipt as if they did it but didn't complete the transaction. ABSOLUTELY RIDICULOUS! When I was talking to the front desk another customer was complaining about the same issue... Coincidence or professional scammers? Probably the latter. I was only staying here because I was exhibiting at the convention center and since it was my first time I thought it would be best to stay close. NEVER AGAIN! Now I see that many other hotels have shuttles to the convention center and I will NEVER stay in their disgusting rooms again!\n\nTrust me do NOT stay here even if they give it to you for free!
2800	0	a	If no stars were possible, I would rate this  a 0!  I was given a different room then I booked.   Upon entering the room it smelled stale, the walls were filthy, and the bathroom not cleaned well.   As for the bed, the upholstery was ripping, the comforter was lumpy, and the box spring mattress caved in the middle. \n\nI've stayed at some questionable motels during road trips across country and this hotel by far took the cake.   The same room service cart from the room next to mine stayed there for 3 days.    I saw a maid walk by it 2 days out and put her Popsicle stick on it continuing to walk  passed it.    \n\nNow, let's talk about the eateries.   The breakfast cafe HORRIBLE! After being seated it took someone 20 mins to ask us if we wanted a drink, then 20 minutes for the waitress to take our order, and 45 minutes to get the less than appetizing food.   Vince Neil's Cantina.. You're better off going to Taco Bell.   \nI only chose this place due to the close proximity to the Mr Olympia Convention.  Lesson learned for next year. Save your money!
2801	0	a	I come to Vegas for work a lot and have stayed all over the place.  This time I had to go cheap because I was billing the client and I got a deal online for 35 a night, I thought what a wonderful price.  I am glad I paid that cheap because the 20 a night reseort fee is a friggin joke.  The young man that checked me in said well all the places do it, well sonny, you are not the Bellagio or Ceasars, sheesh, I don't think Exaclibur even changes that much.\n\nLets break it down, what do you get?  1. Free local calls (ever hear of a cell phone). 2. Internet for one device (we had our own, plus smart phones) and 3. use of the cardio room (the most run down place in the hotel!)\n\nI basically paid 60 dollars for something I didn't even use.\n\nThe room was bog and clean, the overall hotel just had an old feeling to it.  I was amazed how letters were missing from signs and things broken.  You would think that the Westgate would take care of that if they want to draw the crowds.\n\nWhen you take the average night room rate which I think is around 75 and add the 20 resort fee, I can think of quite a few better joints to stay at in Vegas.
2802	0	a	1) I was supposed to have the option of a king sized bed or two full sized bed. The guy never asked me which one I wanted and gave me a room with 2 full sized beds. When I walked in my room my initial thought was that it smelled like smoke. Great. I turned on the air and left for a few hrs. Luckily the smelled died down when I returned. \n2) for those that believe in spirits, I definitely felt a third presence in the room while I was sleeping in room 445 with my daughter. Didnt feel dangerous though.\n3) in the morning I had a question regarding 2 charges I had on my bank account from Westgate so I called them and got a very bitchy lady on the phone that kept interrupting me and had me on hold for 10 minutes.\n4) the resort fees are pretty ridiculous. This hotel isnt all that to be having $18 resort fees.
2803	0	a	So I came back here six or so months after my last visit to what was then LVH. I wasn't impressed then, but I got an offer that was too good to refuse (two nights for $19/night plus resort fees). Upon returning...well, not much has changed besides the name.\n\nRooms: The rooms are an OK size with some nice views. I was in 2442 in the central tower, and I could see SLS to one side and Wynn/Encore on the other. The bed is comfortable; the bathrooms, though? Not so much. It took a good 5-7 minutes for my shower to heat up last night, and the water pressure wasn't good. Additionally, there were some unexplainable black blotches on the tub (almost ink-like).\n\nAs far as amenities are concerned, you supposedly get free wi-fi with your resort fee. I say supposedly because I would not know for sure. I own a MacBook Pro laptop and an iPhone, and neither device was able to connect to the wi-fi in the hotel (seriously, folks, move into the 21st century). Meanwhile, the casino floor is usually dead, the buffet (per my father, who I met in Vegas) isn't great, and the monorail really IS your best friend if you stay here.\n\nI can't in good conscience give this place one star. The staff is friendly, the rooms aren't awful, and I certainly don't feel ripped off given the deal I got. However, would I recommend it to others, especially at full-price? Absolutely not. There are better, probably cheaper options in better locations, and unless the new folks in charge change things and change them quickly, I'm not entirely sure Westgate will be in business much longer.
2804	0	a	This was by far the worst hotel I have every stayed in, this is the 3rd. owner of this building, the Hilton was first, then LVH was the second and now Westgate Resort, check in took a little over 45mins.one of the hotel staff pass out a small bottle of water to people waiting in the check in line, when I got to the room the first thing I notice that the bed did not have a bed spread on the bed so I turn around and ask housekeeping where was my spread she came in and told me they don't use spreads any more one top sheet a thin blanket follow by another sheet, two bottle water $4.00 each coffee two 8oz cups $3.50 each to use the internet hook up in the room $13.99 both phones still have LVH logo on them as the ink pens also laundry/ cleaning bag, this is what really piss me off, I left for a event on Sat morning around 6:45am I return to my room around 2:25pm my room had not been clean I pick the phone up so fast to call the hotel the stupid hotel front desk ( I wish I could remember her name) apparently thought I was a Idiot telling me that housekeeping was still cleaning the rooms......oh yeah at 2:25 most hotels check in is 3:00pm I wonder how many more rooms they forgot to clean, if I could give this hotel a BIG FAT ZREO! I would gladly, so if you don't want your room clean and the staff lying to you then by all means check in here.
2805	0	a	The Westgate was a horrible experience. The room i stayed in was a dump in my view. Stains on the carpet, armchair and beadspread. desk chair broken, window filthy, fridge dirty, furniture scratched and old but, strangely the bed was quite comfortable. The bathroom wasnt clean....a very long black hair was twirled in a big loop inside the bath tub. the vent above the tub was caked with dust. wifi didnt work and it took the internet engineer 90 mins to get here to fix it. the whole place reeks of cigarette smoke and Elvis music is blaring constantly in elevators, lobby areas, restrooms and casino. food not bad. service...lousy. my cowekers had similar complaints. i will never stay in this place again. its dirty, dark and depressing.
2806	0	a	PLEASE dont reserve here you pay for EVERYTHING literally, additional resort fees 19.99 + TAX ask what paying for.... the safe lock that i didnt even use, internet service really didnt use that either, to top that off I got all receipts before I checked out, I check my bank account and was charged 7.00, of course I called they tell me for 2 cups of coffee WTF, i say there is nothing that say there is a fee for the coffee, rep tells me its on the cup the cost is printed on the cup. I had to LOL this hotel was a joke you get what you pay for plus you get riped off by all these additonal charges. so the moral of this story is stay away, read EVERYTHING you may be charged for extra towels you might wanna ask before using. You may be charged for extra sugar please ask before you do, if you flush the toilet to many times watch out you may be charged for it. YOU will get ripped off trust me ....check everything for extra charges. I will never visit this place again. got burned once wont get burned again. lesson learned. pay for a nicer hotel and get your moneys worth, because this one wasnt at all worth it
2807	0	a	Well I'm sorry to say my last visit at the new Westgate LVH was some what of a disappointment . I had reservation's for a handicap room and it wasn't ready so i was put in a regular room and than the heat did not work and i must have my room warm , so they put a block for the room i needed the next day , so much for VIP service , well i got the room i need BUT ! the heat in this room also did not work and to top it off the light in the restroom would not go on , right about than i was thinking what the hell , i called housekeeping and the problem was resolved  ,well i went back up to the room to check on the room only to find that there was a leak in the restroom coming from the ceiling so another problem for housekeeping , what now , i know this Hotel is old but please give me a break , i love staying here I've been staying at the Hotel for about 50 yrs and have seen all the changes but its time to make some repairs , and i will return , I do enjoy eating at TJ'S Stake House and the Buffet  also at the Paradise Cafe where i have some friend's .
2808	0	a	Booked a room pretty last minute at the Westgate Las Vegas on Chase Ultimate Rewards website. Other hotels were well north of $100 a night for a busy weekend, but the UR rate was just $55 per night, so I figured midst well give it a shot. Westgate is off-strip; very close to the LV Convention Center and has a monorail stop (would be more useful if the monorail actually ran 24/7). They ended up charging a resort fee of around $20 per night, which included useless local phone calls, wifi for one device, and fitness center access (a complete rip off). \n\nWe got a Classic room in the Center Tower. The room itself was decent - pretty large in size, two double beds (wish they were queens) and a LCD TV. The bathroom felt very antiquated, but was clean. Cab rides to and from the strip on a busy Saturday night ran around $15-20 including tip. \n\nOverall, Westgate was a clean, affordable option if you just need a place to crash, and don't mind being a little removed from the action.
2809	0	a	This place is a piece of junk!  All these people want to do is sell you  or upgrade you on a time share! My friend had a time share at the Flamingo Bay and they offered to take us to their new hotel and casino,  formally known as the Las Vegas Hotel to take a survey.  Granted the LVH is known for housing one of the most famous icons ever,  Elvis Presley. Now some people,  like ourselves,  might take the opportunity to take the offer since they said that we would be able to visit Elvis Presley's quarters.  However,  after spending 4 hrs, not only did we not get to see Elvis' suite,  but they also sent us to the back of the hotel to take the wrong shuttle!! It literally was a slap in the face just because we didn't end up buying,  or in my friends case, upgrading her time share!! So in short words,  RUN AWAY,  FAR AWAY!!
2810	0	a	Motel 6 is better. We checked in and went to our room that we reserved a week ago. ......NO BED! Yes you read that correctly NO BED! My fiance'goes downstairs to get another room. ....... it's filthy.  So after 3 1/2 hours we still don't have a room. I will never ever stay here again. NEVER! I don't recommend this place to anyone no even my dog. I can't give out a negative star unless I would.
2811	0	a	"The Wesgate is straight up a scam. They have the lowest prices on all the travel sites, and then regardless of the price quoted and who you book through, they require a card at check-in, and then charge a \""Resort Fee\"" on top of whatever you agreed to pay.\n\nYou don't have to use anything - the gym, the pool, the coffee - they just charge it to EVERYBODY. I got stuck with this hotel without being able to check reviews using Priceline's \""Name Your Own Price\"" feature where they pick the hotel, so I couldn't read the reviews in advance and see that it's a scam. Once I got stuck with this racket, I read the reviews, learned about the scam, and asked them about it at check-in and check-out, and they lied to my face both times and said they weren't charging anything extra beyond the Priceline price to my card.\n\nYet they charged the $22.39 extra \""Resort Fee\"" they charge every customer, on top of the agreed upon price plus takes and fees. The owners and management should be in jail. If you get stuck here, don't take it - complain to the travel site, the BBB, the Attorney General of Nevada, and the owner David Siegel. Contest the charges with your credit card. Don't roll over and take it, or they'll just keep ripping everyone off."
2812	0	a	The Westgate prides itself on being the location Elvis chose to stay...unfortunately when you stay there you realize all time stopped when he died and they have done nothing to improve the place since.\n\nRooms are disgusting - they smell and are pretty dirty - stains on wall to boot.\n\nIf you are looking for cheap, maybe this is the place to go but if you can afford an extra 10-15 bucks I'm pretty sure you can get a better deal.\n\nOH and a first for me while traveling, they wanted to charge you $3.50 to have a cup of coffee in the room...really?
2813	0	a	Was stopped twice by the staff for their Time Share Scam. Came out of the elevator and was asked if we wanted a free lunch because we were a guest. Said sure and was told I would have to sit thru their seminar. No obligation, but would need to give them $20 refundable deposit. No Thank You!! Every time we went to our room we would get harassed. This made us not want to go back to the hotel  when we were out on the town. They also charge a Resort Fee and for in-room coffee.

2815	0	a	Went to the brunch buffet last saturday.  No line, which was great, but that was the best part of our experience.  The brunch is now $23, no more local discount available, so $73 for our group of three for an average breakfast.  For this price I would expect more variety and higher end foods, like shrimp.  Champagne was included, but now the waiters pour instead of the bar they had, not a good restriction.  Taking this brunch off of my places to go list.
2816	0	a	We stayed here as it was close to the convention we were attending. The actual property was alright, just a little older. The bathrooms definitely need remodeling, and when we got to our room the heater was broken but the staff did fix it once reported. The daily cleanings didn't include a restock of the toiletries. The overall service at the restaurants and baggage claim were poor. The staff was rude and acting like you were inconveniencing them at times. The one saving grace of this place was their spa/ gym. Their staff and facilities were incredible, but unfortunately this was not the case with the rest of the hotel. The only reason I'm giving this hotel two stars is because of how exceptional the spa staff are. There are a lot of great places and service in vegas but this isn't one of them.
2817	0	a	Well... this was the Hilton. Fyi.....\n\nSo we just checked in. Went up to the room and wanted to give my son a bath.\nHowever, before I could do that I needed to call housekeeping and have them come up and clean the bathroom! !!!!\nHair and dirt in the tub and all over the floor!\nThe bath is old and rusty. The rest of the room  and the hotel is old and run down. \n\nSeeing how they now charge you a resort fee.....( Bull shit if you ask me) ......  They need to clean up their hotel and the rooms!\n\nI will try to attach photos.

My \""newly renovated room\"" had new carpet, yes, but the shower has gunky and broken tiles, my toilet was dirty, and a piece of the window broke and was taped to the window instead of fixed.  I will try to attach images."
2819	0	a	Stayed at the Westgate last month. Had a laptop and Ipad stolen from my room. The hotel provided no explanation and made no attempts to assist. This hotel is not safe. Avoid at all costs.
2820	0	a	"Went for a 90 min. presentation. Ended up spending a total of 3 hours. Was going to walk away from the gifts when the time was getting to 3 hours. Was walking out when  we finally got the 2nd \""manager\"" to okay the refund of our deposit plus the $100.  and  gift coupon.  The only positive was the gal Ana Lisa who did a wonderful presentation. \nBeware if you go to a time share presentation."
2821	0	a	Not only is it not ok for business oriented travellers. (Connected to the convention center) 14.00  a day for internet in the room for one device, business center 2.00 minimum for computer use (on a credit card not the room) 2.50 a sheet for color prints. But the air conditioning is either cold or you put it on half and the heat blows but we have accumulated a 1/4 inch of dust in 4 days because the air filters have obviously have not been changed. All entertainment n the hotel are impersonators and have the higher end on minimum bets for the casinos.
2822	0	a	"The service and food at Westgate Las Vegas Resort & Casino is so bad that if Anthony Melchiorri from the Hotel Impossible show came there he would throw himself off the roof in utter frustration.\n\nCHECK IN: THIRD ROOM WAS NOT A CHARM\nAfter a long wait in line for one of two staff at a desk designed for a dozen staff we were told the king bed, resort level room was not available and we're were assigned a double bed room. No apology.  When I said \""but we booked a king bed room.\"" The desk staff, arrogantly replied, \""Well just because you reserved a king bed it doesn't mean you get one.\"" I ask for a manager and she disappeared for a long while. \n\nShe returned to tell us we could have an \""upgrade\"" but not on the resort floor. We took it. It turned out to be a demi-suite room which you think would be nice. But no. The constant noise sounded like the room was built inside the HVAC system. No one with hearing could ever sleep there. We called the front desk again. \n\nThe put us in a \""newly remodeled\"" room. It should have been termed a \""being remodeled\"" room because it was not finished. The tub was still old and stained, the ceiling plates were missing around the sprinkler heads. The bathroom tile was unfinished. The maximum lighting in the room was DARK. It had three very low wattage lights equaling the light of about 3 candles in total. The maid was even amazed and remarked about the lack to light. The bed was comfortable and we were tired of battling for mediocrity so we took it.  \n\nDAH STAFF\nNo staff member was overly friendly or helpful. When we asked directions to the conference center we got three different answers and just wandered about until we found fellow conferees. \n\nTHE RESORT LOUNGE\nThe resort lounge snack section was so poorly laid out it was funny. It seemed to be designed to encourage groping. When something ran out, the staff just exclaimed \""hruff\"" to our requests and nothing changed. \n\nTHE CREDIT CARD MYSTERY\nOne of our debit cards, which worked in the attached convention center and everywhere else in Las Vegas would not work in the Westgate. Staff just repeated \""call your bank.\""\n\nThe \""Food-like substance\""\nThe restaurant food in the hotel was horrid. Even though I had very low expectations of finding anything healthy to eat, this place managed to puncture those. In this hotel you are trapped unless you want a long walk or taxi ride for every meal. We at fruit in the lounge for every breakfast. Salads in the convention center for every lunch. \n\nFor dinner we tried the 888 Noodle House (in the Benihana). Which meant we got an $20ish (each) Chinese style meal. It was \""egg rolls\"" that tasted like fried sawdust logs. The main dish a plate of vegetables (or chicken) on rice that was so bad you would send it back if you paid $1.99 for it on a food truck. But we were prisoners of the \""resort.\"" \n\nFor another dinner we thought the Buffet would have more options. This was $25 each and worth less than 25 cents each. There was very few vegetarian option and nothing very healthy. The yams tasted like orange colored sugar. The lemonade like 1950's powdered juice. The cob of corn would have been better if it was plastic. And those same saw dust egg rolls were featured here also. They had 4 rice dishes and all but one had chicken broth in it. No creativity or competence. \n\nSUMMARY:\nThe food and service at the Westgate Las Vegas \""resort\"" and Casino says \""We  just don't give a damn.\"" It was the second worst hotel experience of my life. I was a meeting planner for years and stayed it hotels in the Amazon and communist countries that were better."
2823	0	a	"I would give it no stars if I could.

The check in/check out person didn't know what was going on and I asked for a supervisor/manager but no one came out and she told me this is the charge. A few of my other friends had gotten the same charge and not sure if theirs were finally resolved or not. The Customer service was not there. So for that I wouldn't stay there again."
2824	0	a	"The Worst experience of my life!!! DONT STAY, DONT GAMBLE, DONT DO THE TIMESHARE! Horrible location off the strip and shady people working there.\nThey tell u 90 minutes... Plan on 3 hours. We went for a showing and we waited an hour in the waiting room and then they tell us our 90 minutes begins once the tour starts. But the sales people tell you 90 min from when you check in. \n\nWe didn't agree with this so we escalated to a so called \""manager\"" named LOU. She exhibited the worst customer service I've ever seen in my life. All we wanted to do was educate her that her sales people told us 90 minutes from check in, and she said \""well they should be fired\"". Wow... That's un professional. She then told us we need to honor our commitment of 90 minutes or we get nothing promised too us. Talk about shady business practices. As I spoke to her and raised my concerns, she stated if I didn't agree then we need to leave or she would call security on us. Are you serious? She then blamed her sales people for not educating us correctly but she never took ownership or offered to help. She kept looking at her phone and not at us. \n\nStay away from this place. Honestly it's the worst place around with shady business people and horrible management. They don't represent a good atmosphere and try to ensure the customer is always wrong. I'll tell anyone and everyone to NEVER stay here."
2825	1	a	A Fun Night\nI went to see Lee Greenwood at the Westgate on 12-8-14 and thought the show was great. I'm not a great country fan but his act was first class. The Westgate also had a mechanical bull and other activities that really catered to the Rodeo crowd. Everyone seemed to be having fun
2826	0	a	AVOID:\n*Playing money to get money\n*Timeshare Harassment \n*Renovations Expectations\n*Clean Environment\n*Walking with Dignity\n*Watching sporting events\n*Going to get what you came for=\n\nWHAT HAPPENED:\n*Playing money to get money= Got a mailer saying spend $25 get $5. I played on the reel slots and afterwards they said I only played $3, instead of the $25 I played. I came back in a few months and then did it again, but this time on the roulette slot machine, it worked 2 weeks in a row. The 3rd week it didn't and Don the slot manager totally ignored that I did it the last 2 times and just said it will not rate my play. Seems to me their machines are fixed to not acknowledge play and when you contest, they will lie.\n\n*Timeshare Harassment = they have 3 sections to harass patrons with timeshares, Westgate did make their money on it, so no brainier that if you sleep or play here you will get ambush with salesmen literally blocking all important walkways.\n\n*Renovations Expectations=...slow process and so far from the ones completed, not worth your time. Check Red Rock Casino, AWESOME.\n\n*Clean Environment= I noticed all the times I went there, there is a smell, why???\n\n*Walking with Dignity= Near the sports book, I kid you not, there is a major walkway (that is the only access), that is about 3 feet wide. Almost every time we have to maneuver or wait.\n\n*Watching sporting events= They supposedly have a good sports book area, their screens are so out of focus,look into Silverton if your interested, extremely sharp and up-close big screens\n\n*Going to get what you came for= my LAST time going there it had a cowboy theme...really? I mean what a clash of themes. You want a real environment, then go to these\nCowboys = Silverton\n20 year old = Red Rock\nMiddle Age = Caesars Palace\nKids = Circus Circus\nOld Folks = Fiesta in Henderson\nLess Pack, but a lot of punch = Sam's Town, Plaza(downtown),Silver Sevens,Primm/Whiskey Pete/Buffalo Bills, almost all stations,\n\nI'll chalk it as Westgate is trying to make as much money off at least me as possible and they don't care. Watch the owner in the documentary, he was a douche, look how he treated his wife and driver.

This year, we check into a smoking room, asked for non-smoking, and a container of leftover Chinese food in the refrigerator that housekeeping obviously missed. They didn't even leave coffee for the morning but have a Keurig machine in the room. Our dogs kennel is cleaner."
2828	0	a	Westgate took over. Beware of timeshare sales. \n\nThe hotel is undergoing major renovations. Room was without cable for day and a half. Service guy had great attitude. Trying his best. \n\nStay here on a deal. Casino under Hilton and LVH used to pay well. Now slots are tighter. \n\nWord to wise to Westgate: don't ruin what used to be a great hotel.
2829	0	a	We got a good deal here so we said why not try it out. I assumed it would be a great experience but I have to say it was the worst. 5 hrs of my trip spent on this timeshare where they bug you and get a lot of people to harras you into getting one. I don't want a timeshare....thanks but no thanks. The rooms they charge you for everything.....literally everything. Water, coffee, and even to watch tv. They only offered movies and porn. I really enjoyed them having a benihanas there. It was so different from the one here in los angeles. I forgot to mention we had a Jacuzzi in our room that didn't work.....the toilet seat was not all that cleaned. Pretty gross
2830	0	a	Sigh, I just didn't like it here. My sister has a time share so this was our first time checking it out. It's a resort in transition but it had so many problems and it might be best to reduce the rates and shut down some of the resort while they fix it (or shut it down entirely). The only thing I liked about it was that the monorail was on sight. \nHere are my concerns:\nThe greeters. I get this is also a time share place so they won't to get customers but there is a level of annoyance here that borders on harassment which is a major turnoff. \nOur greeter when we got here took us to our room and asked to have brunch with us the next day claiming he was fun.  He was thirty years older than us and that didn't sound appealing. If you want to do a spiel pick people that match the clients.\nThe room was old (there was mold in the bathroom), the shower head sucked (leaky and the stream was not good) the screen of the TV was out of whack. As a time share person our greeter failed to tell us that the water and coffee and internet in the room was complimentary. The owners lounge was shut down so no perks there either. \nThe hotel itself was not appealing. All but one restaurant was shut down and the service at that diner like place was hit or miss. The casino was dead, the music streaming from the hotel was relegated to 1950s and earlier. No night life. Spa was closed. \nI couldn't figure out who the resort was appealing to. Trendy people? party people, older people, family? Not kids- nothing for them to do- there wasn't even a kids channel on the TV . Not the young and the older? Eh, go to Bellagio or the more nostalgic ones like flamingo or harrahs. \nI realize this hotel is in transition but my suggestion is to shut down the old nasty wings and fix them instead of offering them and losing future customers. Then to build your reputation offer a free two nights to the time share people and loyal customers after you have fully renovated and reimaged. get those people to experience the new westgate and spread the word to help bring in new people. The idea is that if you are so far off the strip be a spot that people feel comfortable doing things at and not  always leaving to go to other resorts for everything (like the palms). As of right now, I would never go back unless for free. If you changed your image I'd wait for the reviews on yelp and trip advisor to change before venturing there again and that'd be hard to do without courting people to come.
2831	0	a	I won a football bet at this place and when I went to go to collect, their computers were down. Oh well, it happens. So I went back a few hours later and they were still down. The guy behind the counter was kind of snarky about it and said have a nice flight home sir. Punk. I had to return home, so I had to send in my ticket via mail to get paid. It says that they will send you a check within 4-6 weeks. It's now been 11 weeks and I have been trying to call them to find out the status. Good luck. What do you think they would do if I lost $50 on a blackjack bet and said, hey--I'll be sending you the money in 4 to 6 weeks or maybe never. Some big guy would beat my ass, that's what would happen! The casinos make millions preying on peoples' unrealistic dreams and they already hold all the cards, but they still want to keep my $200? If they feel so strongly about it, keep the money, because life is too short for this nonsense. Pathetic.
2832	0	a	Oh lord.... this place is awful! I cant even begin to explain the horrors of staying here. Never! I know its cheap but crap its not worth the money saved. Run away!!
2833	0	a	I checked in to find a clogged toilet, dirty underwear in the bathroom, and dirty pillow sheets. I thought I checked in to the Westgate, not the SHITgate.
2834	0	a	Check in lines very long! Recently purchased from LVH employees hitting you up to listen to sales pitch to buy in to the resort. Has potential but lacks class, efficiency and appeal given the pricey resort fee for nothing charge. Valet and Bell service lack coordination and efficiency. Sorry to say, think twice before you book. Try the Aria you won't be disappointed!
2835	0	a	I use to love staying at this place as it is off the strip yet off but my last trip on 12/25/2014 was the worst experience ever in this place. The hotel is now falling apart with bathroom lights not working and shower tab running through out the night. After calling 3 times and no show from house keeping, I gave up and cut my trip short at this place. I use to love staying here but will never stay here again!!

I can't even tell) the toll you pay for making eye contact with any employee is an invitation to a timeshare meeting. \n\nAhhhhhhhhhhhh! \n\nI wish it was still all Star Trek themed :("
2837	0	a	If I could give minus stars I would. Probably the worst run hotel I've ever stayed in. Service is beyond slow and unfriendly. Buffet was horrible. No hot water. Room not set up as promised by front desk. I could go on and on. STAY AWAY
2838	0	a	Checked in Tuesday room wasn't ready was sent to another room for 2 hrs then placed in our room. During our stay we didn't receive any housekeeping not towels had trash overflowing! Called front desk took them 2 hrs to bring towels and empty trash! Not pleased with the service at all!
2839	0	a	My first visit was last December 2013, really enjoyed the casino slots, great waitress service while playing, got deals to come back twice during summer and nice amounts to play on and free buffet and even a free show. Got another deal, not as good as LVH offered but did come back just a few days ago, December 27th 2014 and like so many other reviews, I have to agree with a lot of what they are saying. Granted, I guess this whole timeshare resort thing might make things different later on but in the meantime, the annoyance of the greeters for the darn timeshare was a big turnoff this trip. \n\nThe slot machines were not in abundance to begin with when LVH, but it was good enough, however, this trip, several machines were taken out, pretty skimpy now, not many choices. Table games took over and I am not a table player so who knows, maybe this will work but while playing slots, had to listen to construction going on for this International Bar they were madly trying to get built probably for New Years Eve, but all the dust and whatnot from them working all night hours did a number on my allergies, air ventilation not good at all in there like other casinos I have been in. \n\nNot many cocktail waitresses coming around either while playing, was way better before when it was LVH.\n\nAnd this was the worst thing, after telling friends who had never stayed there how good the buffet was, I was so disappointed in how the buffet changed. It was still good and we got it free BUT it was way better before, more great choices and now just mediocre in my opinion AND no more free beer or wine with your dinner which was a great idea especially since this hotel is still looking old. Until it gets completely done, I really think making people pay this resort fee is not ok at all. \n\nI hope they put new soundproof connecting doors in the rooms because my husband didn't sleep at all first night nor did our friends because you can hear people next to you thru that door. Bed was ok, not that comfy, better in other rooms we got there before. Our friends also were given a room that was not clean at all so they had to move but then due to the partiers next door to them who were so loud and security didn't seem to want to take care of, they moved at 2:00 am to yet another room. Second night they called for extra blanket and it took a good 45 minutes or so to get it. \n\nI have stayed at Treasure Island many times and was starting to be ok with LVH and liking it, but I have to say it doesn't even compare to TI now and at TI, I can go across street to other hotels/casinos much easier and the rooms and beds are the best. \n\nPlease bring the old buffet back Westgate and maybe have some kiosks again like LVH did giving you some freebies, like coffee or something. \n\nI will hope that it gets better but this timeshare pushing stuff really does turn me off so would have to be really good deals to get me back.
2840	0	a	Do not stay here! Will ruin your entire vacation! Customer service is unprofessional and sucks.. They do not care about their guests! Their hot water and heaters do not work and their room service doesn't either.. We had to call them twice for house keeping to clean our room and we called 4 times and complained about hot water and heater and they still didn't send anyone up to our room to fix it even though they said they'll send someone over each time we called.. I ended up going downstairs myself and complaining so that they can finally send someone up to our room.. It took them 30 minutes so send a bell man for luggage and their rooms are run down! I will never stay here again!
2841	0	a	We came here for the New Years party and stayed from December 31 through January 2.  During the three days we stayed the hotel ran out of hot water so we had to take a cold shower.  The hotel comped us with a lousy buffet meal.   On January 2nd we left the hotel at noon.  When we came back at 9:30pm the room was not cleaned.  We are not coming back here even though the manager gave us two free nights for the next trip to Las Vegas
2842	0	a	The lobby area definitely looked beautiful but the lack of customer service and room condition brought the impression down tremendously. For starters, the shower drain was clogged. Then the shower pressure was VERY slow, like practically dripping. Then, we had leftover food from Benihana that we needed to heat up to eat and when I called the front to ask for a microwave the lady rudely said there's NOT EVEN ONE microwave in the entire hotel for guests to use. Like.. Seriously?! How is that even possible?? Oh, then we called papa johns for pizza one night and were told that papa johns isn't allowed on westgate property. Cmon people. Settle your differences so guests can have the convenience we pay for.
2843	0	a	From the moment we entered the lobby the Westgate nightmare began. The line to check into our room was a hour wait. After standing in line for just over a hour we headed up to our room to find a king size bed for 4 people. When I called down to the front desk to let them know we had paid for an upgraded room and there were 4 people and one bed the front desk staff was curt and not interested in providing any help other than sending someone up to the room with a key for another room. No one offered to help move our luggage or give us directions to our new room. When we made the long trek to our room we opened the door and found our room less than desirable.  The room was small, dusty, dingy and stunk.  There was painter's tape left on the ceiling, the paint to the bathroom door was peeling off....I could go on and on about the horrible conditions of this hotel. I will spare you and advise to stay away from this establishment at all costs. There are much cleaner places to stay in Vegas that do not mislead you or mistreat you. This hotel needs much help. The other negative reviews I have read are spot on!
2844	0	a	I found a employee holiday deal for $48 per night on line, I made reservation and receive a confirmation, a week before my trip,  I called the resort to confirm it, they told me that i reserved the room thru the 3rd party on line, they couldn't help me, I had to contact on line company, I went to the West Gate Resort website and didn't know how did it re-route to other web site.\n\nAt the time of check in, I was up grade to JR. suite without additional charge, I reconfirmed it with the staff inside the VIP lounge, she said yes, free upgrade, BUT when I checked out, they charged $55 upgrade fee PER NIGHT, I argrued with the staff, she said that I requested it, there was nothing she could do to help me since this reservation was online, I spend 20 minutes in the VIP lounge, there was no manager in at that time, I could not do anything but paid it, they already charged my credit card. FOR THE RATE, it wasn't worth the time and hustle to deal with this when you are on vacation... Yu want to enjoy your vacation,\n\n, you can get a better rate or same rate for some hotels on strip, this way you don't have to drive and deal with the traffic
2845	0	a	"DO NOT DO THE TIMESHARE PRESENTATION!!  We were offered $100 each in gambling money + a free buffet each for attending.  It went an HOUR longer than they said, the buffet was a crappy snack, the gambling money was only for tables and they take it away even if you win!  \nOur room was just okay, even though they said it was a \""free upgrade\"".  Yes the room was large but it wasn't very nice.  The room was shabby and worn out, had low water pressure, bad heat, and hard beds.  The cleaning lady walked in on us without even knocking first.  The buffet was closed at 4:00 pm so we ate at Sid's Place Restaurant where we were served cold chicken noodle soup, a well done burger (which we ordered medium), and cold french fries.  One pro was that the monorail has a stop at the Westgate and that was convenient.  Might or might not stay here again depending on the price."
2846	0	a	They send us information to stay there with discounts. We call and they said they made a mistake so the flyer we got was not valid for superbowl weekend but it did not say any changes. They said it was there mistake. This is the second time I have written something negative about this place. Really
2847	0	a	This place was alright when it was a hilton property, now it's beyond horrible!! Had to switch rooms three times due to smell and no AC !! Don't even think about staying here.  Horrible !!!
2848	1	a	I'm so glad that there is a new location by this area!  Cafe rio is a great Mexican restaurant at a pretty reasonable price. This is not an authentic Mexican restaurant but the food is still delicious. They are well known for their sweet pork and their enchilada style burrito. I would recommend to try the salad or the burrito although you won't be disappointed with anything you order here
2849	0	a	Food is good but service is terrible, we are party of two and we get only one napkin cuz they don't have to many, only a few left, really?, they prepare the food the way they wanted no the way I want like the guacamole outside the burrito not inside like I want, plus they cover the outside with guacamole, bad experience
2850	0	a	I was so happy cafe rio was in summerlin. First day I go there with my son and the girls for my order all wrong. Kids quesadilla and a salad but ok first week opening I figured they are new but the one girl who finishes the orders before the cashier has the worst attitude ever!!!!!! I love the food so I come again a few weeks later. Same girl same stink attitude!! Cashier was rude too. So I love the food but I'll never come here again.
2851	1	a	Quick and easy pick up.  A new location so new employees but over all the same food as all other locations.  I love the Chicken Salads.
2852	1	a	We almost didn't go due to a couple of bad reviews but decided to check it out for ourselves. Glad we did. Greeted with a friendly smile by girl doing clean up. Waited on by friendly server who made our orders neatly and promptly. The other folks behind counter quickly responded to our special requests with a smile. We ordered nachos and the whole crew broke out in a short rendition of 'Nacho Man'. Fun, friendly,  clean atmosphere.  Very good food, just like the CR on Centennial. Looks like this location has cleaned up their act.  Perhaps those who wrote the bad reviews will give them another try after all and rescind them.
2853	0	a	So third try, not a charm. Everytime I have tried the Summerlin location the service is horrible. Today I was the only person in line and it was like I was bothering them with my basic order as they hurried me along not listening to anything I ordered. By the way besides the employee making my food every employee behind the counter were on their cell phones. The portions may be big but the flavor it's blah.....
2854	0	a	Do not call head they freget about your order. But food is go. But service suck I got there order was not field and wait 1:45 to fill it. I should of got in line it would of been faster. Next time I will go to the one on Sahara. That never happen to me at that location.
2855	0	a	Kinda grossed out tonight normally love this place but the expo tonight was wearing gloves then Used cleaning product to wipe down the counter still with her gloves on and when a guy and his daughter ordered there food she wiped her hands with the dirty rag and made there quesadillas and tacos!! Super gross gloves are meant to be worn and once you touch chemicals or a dirty rag you should change them before going back to touch the food. This is stuff you should already know when working in a restaurant aren't you required to have a health card !!! Because this is a question on there! Management needs to have a talk with there staff about health because if someone were to get sick it could be bad. And to top it all off when I got home to eat my burrito the meat (Asada) was burnt. I won't be back here for a while. Disappointed..
2856	1	a	Steak burrito, enchilada style was excellent!\nI got mine with the cilantro rice, black beans, steak, and hot sauce.\nEven though I got their hottest hot sauce it didn't seem spicy at all.\nThey put the enchilada sauce and cheese on top then send it through a little conveyor belt oven that toasts the top beautifully!\nA little lettuce and pico on the side... yummy!
2857	0	a	This location needs work. The food line is a cluster, they are all over the place. You need to watch them because they forget things. Soup was cold, tortilla was cold. They have 3 different kinds of tea and they were all empty! Annoying. I keep thinking they will get better but im disappointed every time.
2858	1	a	"Cafe Rio is one of my favorite place(s)\nThe workers all have a happy face\nGet your butt into that line\nLook up and you'll see some fresh limes\nCheck out the menu is has a lot of food\nAll of which is super good\nI always order the fire grilled chicken (salad)\nThe reason why is cuz it's bitchen\nFresh tortilla, tender chicken, salad, and some beans\nThat meal right there is fit for a Queen\nI top it with some creamy cilantro\nAnd always ask them for extra que-eso\n\nOk, this is a new Cafe Rio and it's semi close to my house. I legit love it, and will carb out on their fresh tortillas any day! I'm loyal to the fire grilled chicken salad (+1$ for grilled chicken) it's topped with your choice of beans and rice, chicken, salad, tortilla strips, queso, and cilantro with a side of guac. I get it sans pico though. \n\nAll of the items on the menu are delicious, their steak is never over cook, nor is the fire grilled chicken. Most of them items can be ordered \""wet\"" but I never opt for that.\n\nThey have a variety of drinks including horchata, jamaica, and mint teas as well as the fountain drinks.\n\nI really like the customer service here, the workers are all super nice even when gringas make a big deal over not having green sauce ready THAT MINUTE. Lort forbid they had to wait 3 minutes. HMPF.\n\nAnywho, I got some bogo coupons (Rare!) so I def utilized them!!\n\nI love you CR!\n\nYay!"
2859	0	a	"The food was just really bad. The onion rings might have been good if the breading weren't cold and mushy. The \""Grilled\"" hot dog had the taste and texture of boiled wiener. It was actually cold in the center. The buns were room temperature. This place makes me miss Indulge Burger even more. I would never eat here again."
2860	1	a	Really good burger and fries. I thought the burger was a little small, but very good. I got a sample of the seasonal beer before committing. I really liked it as well. Service was excellent. The young woman at the checkout checked on us later to make sure everything was good.  I will probably be back.
2861	1	a	"I stopped by for a quick bite to eat. I ordered the \""Big Big Burger\"" and a create your own chocolate custard with brownies, marshmallow, whipped cream and oreo cookies. \n\nThe burger was cooked and in my hands within 10 minutes of ordering it.The difference in the burger between any other place and this place is that Burger N Fries makes theirs from all natural grass fed beef. In case your wondering, you can taste a difference. Instead of having no taste and being overcooked, the burgers served here are full of juice and are perfectly cooked. \n\nThe custard ice cream was quite the shake! \n\nI was happy to see that the restaurant including the bathrooms were VERY clean. This is something this restaurant does extremely well. \n\nThe service was pretty good. I think they could improve a little on more interactions with the customers. For example, it would be good to greet the customer when he/she enters the restaurant and leaves. The water cups were pretty small. I would like to see them make the change to a larger cup so that the customer doesn't have to get up and refill their drink after every 3-4 sips. \n\nOther than that, they have made some improvements since the last time I visited. Keep up the hard work."
2862	0	a	I had high hopes after seeing a new burger with natural beef open up.  There is some decent options to customize a burger, but with dietary restrictions it seems more like a burden asking questions about what's in certain sauces.  Also the burger is very small.  Literally like a large slider.  I don't know if it even qualified as a quarter pound burger. If the meat didn't have a great taste it would have resulted in a 1 star.  I hope they can turn things around, staff be happy to serve, and the burger size increase dramatically.
2863	0	a	"Nice location... food disappointing. Nice sunny corner location with sliding doors for an open air feel on a nice day. Very friendly staff though I noticed they had trouble keeping track of customer orders (need a numbering system). Everything was served quickly and hot.\nI had a double mushroom burger with fries and a drink. Not much taste to the undersized burger and the fries were just OK. I wanted to like this place... but taste comes first and it just wasn't up to par with the cost... guess I'll stick to less \""natural\"" offerings for now."
2864	0	a	"We decided to place an order and then go pick it up. The service was SLOW and DISORGANIZED. We paid for one hot dog (the smallest hot dog I have ever seen) and 4 burger (again they were very tiny and they only gave us 3). When we got home, lo and behold, they forgot the rest of the order. We also ordered a large fries and a large Onion Ring When we placed the order the sales person told us that the larges would feed 2 very hungry people and 3 so- so hungry people. So the large order of onion rings turned out to be 5 rings. Taste was so-so. Nothing to write home about. When I called and told them they did pack our 4th burger, the response on the other end was \""so do want to come back and get it\""? No actually we won't be back."
2865	0	a	"Style over substance. This restaurant has a lot of polish to it but it's missing a lot of details that would make it more enjoyable for the diner.\n\nThe menu is printed on a 6' tall mirror as you walk in. It's not easy to read the menu especially when the mirror is reflecting a dark background, like dark clothes that you're wearing. I went safe and just ordered the All American Burger and shared a large fries with Parmesan and herbs. Also ordered an iced tea.\n\nI was bummed that there weren't burger patty options on the menu, like bison, buffalo, turkey, etc. (If they were there I couldn't see them - see paragraph #2)\n\nWhen you get to the register to order, you do get a nice warm greeting and friendly service. However, you can't see the menu anymore and it's a bit frustrating. They have two monitors on the back wall showing random product images but those images don't seem relevant or captivating, and even seem washed out from either poor monitors or poor photography. I think they'd be better served by having menu panels where customers are used to seeing them vs. a picture of ripe tomatoes.\n\nI went to get my iced tea and found that they use Coke's bag-in-box Gold Leaf tea. So, it's \""natural\"" burgers and \""formerly natural\"" iced tea. I don't drink soda and I like good iced tea so I am dismayed when restaurants choose bag-in-box tea products vs one of the many quality fresh brewed products that are out there.\n\nThe burgers and fries came out in a timely manner with friendly service. The food was delivered on half sheet pans - one for my friend's hot dog (which was in a small paper tray), one for the fries, one for my burger. \n\nThe burger is tiny, like McD's Quarter Pounder sized. I'm not looking for a huge burger but this little 4\"" bun looked even worse sitting on the acreage of an otherwise empty half sheet pan. The presentation was awful. The burger did taste good but for the size it was more like a $4 burger especially since it doesn't include a side of fries. The fries were good and worth ordering again.\n\nI want to like the place. It's nice with the open garage doors, the Big Ass Fan on the ceiling, the friendly service. But it seems that they put their money on the glitz of the project vs. on things that make dining better, and easier."
2866	1	a	"This Environmentally conscious upbeat modern restaurant serves great tasting burgers w/ fresh all-natural ingredients as well as crispy and tasty fries.  The small order is plenty to fill you up.\n\nCheck out the cool \""Big Ass fan\"" and the recycled chairs!  They highlight the efforts that this business promotes to protect the environment.  The open sliding doors around the restaurant during the nice cool weather, gives you a nice breeze while keeping the dining area open and inviting.\n\nAll of the food looks as good as the pictures on the monitors behind the registers.  We appreciated the sampling of the Cows (flavored floats).  You'll like them, I guarantee it.\n\nOn my visit, I ordered the Arizona burger which is a burger with a Serrano pepper cooked into the beef, and topped with two deep fried Serrano peppers and Chipotle Aioli made this burger one to try!  Thanks Valerie for your perfect service.  You and Burger N Fries need more stars.  This place is one of the best places I've been in a long time.\n\n-Christian"
2867	1	a	I had the pleasure of trying Burger n Fries yesterday. Since the products are all fresh and natural, I loved eating all that I ordered. It's hard to find onion rings like these and I enjoyed eating every single one.
2868	0	a	I decided to give this place a try because I received a flyer with coupons in the mail. The flyer advertised that they deliver and that was the selling point.\n\nThe girl who answered the phone wasn't friendly. She sounded bored and aggravated.\n\nI missed some calls n texts while I was busy because the delivery girl couldn't find my apartment. I didn't even know until after the delivery. I'm not sure how long she spent looking, but she didn't say a word and seemed pissed. Also, my food was cold and the fries weren't even edible. I feel bad about the inconvenience of not being able to find my place, but seems odd since it has never been an issue before.\n\nThe burger was okay. Kinda plain and pretty small. The fries might have been better hot, but just seemed okay as well. The custard was alright, but just not blended that well. I'd rather just make the drive to Smashburger if I'm craving a burger n fries.
2869	1	a	As you may be able to tell from my other reviews, Indulge closing sent me into a deep, that-was-my-favorite-place-ever depression. I just wanted to know WHY and was left without any answers, like my boyfriend had just broken up with me and not given me any closure. I had never had a burger so delicious. Every place I go is measured against Indulge, and no one ever stacks up. When I saw this place opening, the font felt familiar and my conspiracy theories kicked in. Maybe my beloved Indulge was opening up under a new name. I have since been assured that is not at all the case (more tears). We finally got over there to try Burgers N Fries tonight.\n\nI love the doors (saw that someone didn't like those) and the open feeling. The menu on the mirror is a bit hard to read, but I know what I want so no biggie. We ordered and everyone was very nice. The food came really fast and the girls came by our table a bunch and were SUPER nice. Now....to the big moment...the burger was GREAT. I hate overly complicated burgers or burgers that taste like they were cooked at home. This was neither - it was just good, basic and delish. If I were to say Indulge burgers were 9.5, this burger was an 8.75 or 9. The closest I have been able to find since Indulge closed. I will say maybe the cheese slices could be a bit thicker, maybe a tiny bit more cheese. Anyhow, I actually LOVED that it wasn't this massive thick burger. I can't eat all that anyhow (and really, shouldn't we all stick to smaller portions my fellow Americans?). The men can get the double if they need it. \n\nThe fries were good and the shake was great (maybe a tiny bit too thick which sometimes can make it not as cold as I'd like). I love custard, mmm! \n\nOur meal for two people came to about $30, which did kind of feel over-priced. But, knowing this is the closest I have been able to get to my fave burger, I am willing to pay it! \n\nOne thing I will add specific to other reviews about natural beef. It is a HUGE deal, and I will ONLY eat at places with natural/grass fed beef. If you don't care, you should. \n\nI hope they make it, don't be the second to break my heart (stomach)! \n\nPS I am still wondering why my boyfriend Indulge broke up with me. WTF happened to them? I thought things were going so great with us. ;)
2870	0	a	Really overpriced, 6 or 7$ for 4 gyozas made of beans. Took over an hour to be seated even with a reservation. Ran out of 2 of our dishes and didn't even bother to tell us. Took over 50 minutes to bring our food.
2871	0	a	Went to kyozon for the first time for my friends' birthday party and her reservations were at 8pm but they didn't have our table ready until 8:30pm. I mean, if we were to have reservations at the restaurant, the least they could do is tell us 8:30pm instead of making us wait. Service was definitely slow and could have been a little faster. \n\nThe food was decent, it was nothing special.  I ordered the sobe sushi roll (honestly, I've had better sushi),  and the chicken pad Thai (not too bad).  What I liked most about the restaurant is the ambiance and the decor.  It looked very traditional Japanese style restaurant. Other than that, nothing too special. \n\nSomeone should also ask about the kaiten belt. So this is the belt that you can grab sushi off and then they charge you afterwards depending on the color of the plate and how many plates. I didn't have their kaiten belt, but I did ask a waitress about the belt and how they ensure the food safe of the food (so that it's not just rotating around for hours without a customer grabbing it) and she had no idea and made up some reason that did not make sense.
2872	0	a	Went for lunch on a Saturday afternoon and the place was near empty. Sat upstairs in a booth by the Kaiser belt. Was told it was $17 per person for all you can eat sushi plus a la care items. The food on the belt was good - not great - but found the food pretty boring and unimaginative. I know it's just sushi, but they didn't have a lot of variety. I would not return.
2873	0	a	Probably one of the worst restaurants in downtown Montreal. The decor however is exquisite however once you absorb the following the sushi is far from worth the $. Unlike other all, you can eat restaurant, Kyozon's hard to explain menu makes it a hassle for any consumer to appreciate its experience. The lack of training from its staff and inattentive customer service saddens me especially with the upscale d\u00e9cor. Extremely pricey for the few selections of sushi available (avg. price of 3.25 $ sushi).  In my personally opinion, the marketing team in this restaurant lacks the understanding of a consumer and seems to try to confuse its consumers instead of understanding them.  Despite the negative experience, Kyozon is still new and still has chance to redeem themselves however, I for one will not be going back to this restaurant nor will I refer it.  Best of luck
2874	0	a	"Our personal experience with this pediatricians office was bittersweet. Prepare yourself, this is gonna be a long review!\n\nI gave birth to our daughter last year in September, and the pediatrician that saw her and checked up on us while we were in the hospital was absolutely amazing, She belonged to this practice, so we just followed her there to continue seeing her.\n\nUnfortunately, this office was not nearly as amazing as our pediatrician. As with all newborn visits, we were going frequently for about five months. We made five visits total, and each visit was a below average experience. The ONLY reason we stuck it out as long as we did was for the pediatrician.\n\nFirst, the look and feel. The lobby is small, outdated, and very uncomfortable. The majority of the chairs were the little kindergarten desk chairs, and they littered the open space in a messy and unorganized manner. We had to climb over a number of obstacles just to get to an open seat where we felt somewhat comfortable. From the T.V. to the mural on the wall, everything was so old looking. Even the magazines were outdated, by months. I always felt very uncomfortable and out of place, as if I was sitting in a home where I was unwelcome.\n\nSecond, the cleanliness. My goodness, this place was not up to par with my expectations of cleanliness for pediatricians. The lobby always had some sort of trash on the few side tables that were available. I could let that go if it weren't for the rooms. The one place I would expect thorough cleanliness is the examination rooms. Every time we waited in the room, I could not WAIT to get my daughter out of there! In our short time there, we saw leftover, half eaten candy, crumpled up paper towels, dried up spills, and even a stray diaper that somehow didn't make it into the trash bin. Gross!\n\nThird, the office staff. On almost every visit, they were rude, unorganized, and quite honestly lazy. They oozed a \""I have better things to do\"" attitude. They never kept the lobby clean, and the movies on the T.V. were almost always stuck on the title menu. They couldn't even pay attention to that! Their lack of attention to detail and their awful attitudes always had me leaving in a bad mood.\n\nFourth, the waiting. We waited for at least 45 minutes every time, despite being 10-15 minutes early. I understand falling behind in appointments, but waiting this long every single time and seeing patients who came in well after us getting called before we did was not cool. And even once we got in the room, we waited for AT LEAST another 30 minutes before finally seeing our doctor. Just waiting was exhausting in itself, especially with a newborn.\n\nFinally, the straw that broke the camel's back. On my last visit, I literally waited for an hour and a half before finally getting into the back. The only reason I waited so long was because the office staff said my daughter was due for vaccinations, and I had already paid my co-pay. When I finally got a room (which had a lollipop stick stuck to the exam bed) I waited for another half hour before I finally grabbed someone from outside our room in the hallway and asked them how much longer our doctor would be. She had no idea. I told her we were just here for vaccinations. She checked our paperwork and told me that according to our chart, my daughter was not getting shots that day. That was it! I gathered my things, strapped my daughter back in her carseat, and just walked out of our room. As busy as the traffic in the hallway was, no one noticed. I kindly told the front desk that I had been waiting over two hours with no sight of my doctor and I was given a \""that's too bad\"" half-ass apology. I never went back.\n\nWhile our pediatrician was awesome, she alone did not make up for the awful experiences we had every single time we went in for my daughter's check ups. I originally started this review with two stars, think one star might be too harsh. But after re-living everything and writing it all down, I know that one star definitely describes our experience with this place."
2875	0	a	"Not happy with my experience here. First of all everyone in the front office was... Useless. I had to repeat myself to the lady on the phone about 17 times. The doctor we saw in the hospital (Maxcy) wasn't personable at all. Their hold information stated \""our physicians will not be accepting patients who will not be vaccinated\"" when I asked the front desk staff what this meant she said \""it depends on the doctor\"" hmm.. Ok... I should have just gone somewhere else at this point, we aren't withholding vaccines but we are delaying them... And if you make a statement like \""our physicians will not accept...\"" You should probably know the details. We sat in their FILTHY waiting room for 25 minutes past our appointment time after being told to check in 25 minutes early for 5 minutes of paperwork. When we finally got back for our appointment and I discussed the immunization thing with the doctor (hep B specifically- why it isn't just given later in life since most infants aren't at high risk) she said \""well sometimes people never bring their kids in for checkups so you have to catch them as soon as they are born to vaccinate them\""... THAT IS NOT A GOOD REASON FOR ANYTHING. At this point I was over it. I didn't want to go through the hassle of finding another pediatrician but this place is a joke. Will never use them again."

2877	0	a	"Ho boy, I was excited for a ramen specialty shop to finally open in Chubana. This restaurant did a superb job in crushing all my ramen dreams. \n\nFirst off, the neophyte employees don't seem to understand how ramen refills work. First off, you can only order extra noodles during your order. Instead of putting the noodles in an empty bowl, they just add it into your ramen when it's made. \n\nIf working on a Monday had a flavor, it would taste like the noodles and broth served here. The noodles tasted fairly mundane and the broth itself was bland. What surprised me was that the Curry chicken ramen I ordered was done Chinese-style rather than Japanese style. What this means is that the chicken in the ramen had bones, so it was fairly annoying randomly biting into bones while I ate my food. Also, the flavor of the broth didn't really resemble Japanese curry; it seems that they tossed some hot spices in the hopes that we wouldn't recognize that it's not Japanese curry. \n\nAlso, I was surprised by the rave/trance music playing in the background... I'm no fan of this sort of music, but I honestly wonder if the owners did some sort of market analysis and found out what UIUC students like listening to. It wasn't even good rave music either. They had a rave version of Justin Bieber's \""Baby.\"" I don't really have anything against him, but I do question the music selection here. \n\nNot only was stomach absolutely pissed at what I had subjected it to, my wallet was equally furious as well. The ramen bowls cost around $11 each (they normally cost $7-$8 at other places). But when you're the only ramen specialty shop in town, I suppose you can charge whatever you want."
2878	0	a	"Pretty disappointing, honestly.\n\nI've been eagerly waiting for my first try at Koto Ramen since I spotted the place under interior decoration early in summer. When I actually went there, it was like my ramen dreams shattered. \n\nI have to admit that I'm not an expert in Japanese ramen, but ramen at Koto is not what I wanted. I ordered miso ramen with pork. The broth was kind of like a universal broth with miso paste dissolved. I keep saying to myself \""no they won't charge $9.99 for that kind of inferior mixture\"", until a block of undissolved miso paste sickened me.\n\nThe standard bowl comes with pretty little noodle, three slices of very thin pork, half a well-done cook egg, and some spare bean sprout and corn kernels. I'd say that they overcharge it way too much.\n\nCustomers are responsible to take used tableware to a tray, but wiping the tables clean should be taken care of by attendants. I arrived at 5pm, definitely not rush hour, but the table was sticky and greasy."
2879	0	a	"I have scoured the world in search of sublime authentic ramen, which has landed me in countries around the world and especially at ramen's heart of origin, Japan. \n\nSubjectively, Koto should receive no stars for its improper use of ingredients, a lackadaisical preparation process and poor value. Objectively however, Champaign Urbana is not a destination of culinary paradise either.\n\nTo provide an assessment of Koto with a point of reference of world class ramen is unfair. So on the standards of Champaign savor, measured to the likes of Chipotle, Cravings, Bangkok Thai, Torticas and the much heralded McDonalds, Koto should be correctly placed at a 1.5 rating. It is rounded up to 2 as a gesture of good will. \n\nPros\n+ Effort for attempting to replicate authentic ramen in Cornfield, Illinois\n+ Clean environment, refreshing decor\n+ Reasonable menu\n\nCons\n\n- A futile attempt at ramen replication, ironically due to the lack of effort\n- Cheap ingredients\n- Does not offer Tonkotsu broth (an important soup base in ramen derieved from pork bones and fat)\n\nMy order and assessment: Shoyu (Soy sauce) Pork Ramen\n\nThe core of ramen lies within two primary aspects, the broth and a wheat based ramen noodle. \n\nBroth is characterized by two types. The first is a lighter broth such as soy sauce. It acts as a secondary flavor to amplify the inherent taste of other ingredients used. Normally lighter broths are quite refreshing and also providing a sensation of warmness to the dish. The second is a rich broth such as Tonkotsu. It requires a lengthy preparation process as it aims to release every fraction of flavor from its soup ingredients which involves the boiling of pork bones and fat for multiple hours. This results in a broth that is rich, pungent but not overwhelming. \n\nWhat I was given instead of standard Shoyu was a cheap chicken broth that was grease ridden and no different to a 30 cent chicken soup from K-Mart. It was edible, just barely. It was not ramen broth...it was chicken soup. Cheap chicken soup. \n\nRamen noodles are the second core of a ramen bowl. To highlight the importance of the noodle, the term \""ramen\"" itself translates literally to \""pulled noodle\"". This is a noodle dish and for obvious reasons the noodle component is imperative. \n\nKoto however resorted to using a prepackaged thin ramen variant with an overwhelming egg flavor, and a lingering vile unidentifiable aftertaste.  It is acceptable to use prepackaged noodles as fresh ramen production is understandably difficult, however Koto's parsimonious noodle selection was absolutely unforgivable. It was not a far step away from our beloved Maruchan, less than 20 cents a pack, in this $11 bowl of ramen atrocity. \n\nThe pork topping was laughable. It was slices of unseasoned half cooked pork, overcooked using a blow torch (literally) and over-overcooked when sitting in the warm broth. Not much to add to lederstreifen and broken jaws. \n\nI have the full capacity to afford a $11 ramen bowl, but given the criminally low quality of ingredients used in this bowl of horror, my visit was outright robbery. \n\nThen again this is Champaign, so a very generous two stars to Koto."
2880	0	a	"I'll be the first to admit that I know very little about authentic ramen. None, actually. However, I do have the good fortune of possessing taste buds, a feature that I would have gladly seen diminished during my trip to Koto Ramen.\n\nWorking on campus right across the street, I'm always interested when a new lunch option opens up. After my initial disappointment about the latest offering being yet another noodle & rice type of place, I decided to check it out.\n\nFirst, owing to my acknowledged ignorance about the menu and genre, I asked the order taker/cashier what he might suggest. \""Order whatever you like,\"" was the ever-so-helpful reply. I doubled back with, \""What do most people order?\"" thinking you can't really dodge that one. Miso, he said. So I ordered the pork miso ramen to go.\n\nI nestled up at the counter, overlooking the glass-front prep/kitchen area. Reminded me of Shakey's pizza where you could watch the dough fly and toppings scatter. And then I noticed something that really caught my eye. A woman worker pulled out these little gray strips of meat, laid them out on a baking sheet, then pulled out a blowtorch and started giving them the flame. I've since learned that this is a Japanese technique that calls for searing the fat with high heat. Not sure her technique was, um...valid.\n\nThe result was absolutely disgusting. The ramen itself might have at one time been palatable (no better than the $.19 cent County Market variety, though) but instead the entire \""dish\"" was infused with the distinct flavor of propane. I was sick to my stomach for the rest of the day.\n\nOh, and it was $11 for this disappointment. Don't waste your time or money."
2881	0	a	My friend and I got a miso ramen and curry ramen. I tried both of them and I have to say that the curry ramen tastes just like you add some cheap curry powder into miso ramen, it was extremely salty and greasy.  And chickens in these ramen were just like you throw frozen chickens right into boiled water, they taste like trashy potatoes. Come here if wanna try something much more expensive but worse than Instant noodle.
2882	0	a	Since I have lived in Japan for some tinr, I am rather picky about my ramen. \n\nFirst of all, this place does not offer japanese ramen, even their shoyu broth is.. simply shoyu (soy sauce) and broth.. whereas real japanese shoyu broth is much more than that. I'm Chinese despite my wife being Japanese, so I have nothing against them... but I just want to point out that their ramen is Chinese Japanese fusion. The taste was so so, I had the braised beef topping. \n\nAlthough customer service was good, food is so so, and price is kind of on the high end for noodles.
2883	0	a	"First of all, a store that is advertised as a Ramen store should at least be using real Ramen noodles. Instead, they committed the biggest food crime by substituting the more expensive Ramen noodles with Chinese lo mein noodles. To make it worse, the broth is basically hot water with tons of MSG. The pork tastes like dry cardboard and it seems that the chef do not even know how to properly cut a meat. The egg is over boiled and even the mushroom used are the ones used for the actual lo mein dish. The worst crime is to actually having the audacity to charge $9 for a \""lo mein soup\"".\n\nI would recommend not supporting a dishonest business that tries to trick the customers. Basically, if you are looking for some decent Ramen, AVOID this place at all costs!"
2884	0	a	"I've never really hit up the Ramen scene yet, even though it seems to be taking over everywhere.  This place was brand new to town, Sakanaya has been around a while, but decided to give this place a try at a friend's request.\n\nFirst of all, having no exposure to the ramen scene, I expected to walk in and find prices for food to be 4 or 5 dollars for a bowl of ramen.  After all, you can get a cup ramen for 25 cents, so a reasonable upcharge on upscaling a cheap food item, I was thinking 4 or 5 dollars.  So as you can imagine, walking in and seeing prices in excess of $12 or $13 dollars sort of took me by surprise.  I almost decided to leave right there seeing as dinner for two was going to set me back 30 dollars with tip, and 30 dollars for ramen?  Chipotle or Five Guys would be a better investment, value to deliciousness ratio.\n\nStill, this being my first exposure to ramen, I guess it was educating to find out that everyone is upcharging this much.  I don't know what the possible overhead could be on some of these items.  A simple bowl of ramen in excess of 10 dollars... there had better be a side of cucumber salad, a 6 piece California maki, and some green tea included or something, alas no... it was just the ramen.\n\nSo on the merits of value, this places gets a 3/10.  I don't feel as ripped off as when I go to a tapas place, or go to GT Fish and Oyster in Chicago (where I feel as though they take my money, my clothes, my dignity, and my self respect, and in return, they give me two oysters that taste like freezer burn thawed dressed up snot balls).  But if this is to be a regular joint for me to visit, value's gotta be upwards of a 7 or 8 out of 10 value.  And in today's economy, I'd argue it's that simple.  Keep it affordable, and I'll continue to come around.  \n\nMy wife got the kalbi ramen, good choice.  I decided to make myself feel less ripped off and went for something simple, chicken teriyaki, to see how this place would spin a beloved classic.  \n\nMy wife's ramen was actually pretty dang good.  Some insider information has informed me that the cooks have been doing it for 3+ decades, and know what they are doing.  Ramen noodles are of the highest quality, and the broth is not overly seasoned needlessly.  \n\nWhat surprised me the most was the quality of the kalbi she had.  It wasn't garbage meat that you pick up in the \""unknown meat\"" section of the super market, but it was a high quality melt in your mouth giant piece of kalbi.  Really good.  The additional fixings in her ramen were less than remarkable.  Where I praise the quality of the kalbi, and the ramen noodles themselves, the broth though it tasted good, was extremely greasy.  A flash refrigeration cycle to get the fat solidified on top, then skimmed, and reboiled wouldn't hurt in their food prep procedures.\n\nAfter only a few spoonfuls of the broth, I felt like my face was oozing garlic and someone had put sesame oil on their hands, and rubbed it all over my face.  So, probably some of the prep process can be improved over all there.  A fat skimming refrigeration of the broth would go a long way.\n\nThe chicken teriyaki I got was unremarkable.  Surprised since it cost I think $8 or $9.  I was expecting a sizable portion and a bunch of fixings to balance out the chicken, but no, just salad, rice, and the chicken.  Even after adding in overhead and paying people, justifying $8 or $9 for that is pretty unheard of.  From a taste perspective, it was just standard.  I'd go as far as to say it lacked inspiration or imagination, and more enjoyment could have been realized from baking plain chicken at home, and pouring store bought teriyaki sauce on it. Perhaps a bit harsh there.\n\nOn the merits of taste in general, the place gets a 6/10.  The savior was the ramen (as expected).\n\nFrom a service perspective, the people were great, polite.  I did feel as though once I had paid, I was dead to the hostess, and any further dealings with me would be a waste of her time.  For being someone who has no idea about the ramen scene, I was expecting her to tell me what to do, or what to expect, where I can get my food, or who will be delivering it to my table, etc. So I picked up some napkins, and some plastic utensils, not having any idea what to expect.\n\nAll of a sudden the cook yelled out a number.  Having no idea what was going on, I sought the receipt that I had crumpled up into my pocket, only to realize that I'm supposed to get my own food.  That's totally fine of course, except for the fact that no one told me how anything worked.  So for 30 seconds, the cook continued to yell out a number and got increasingly upset. My bad, I didn't know!  Merits of service.  3/10.\n\nFinal thoughts.  Cost doesn't justify volume of food, and just \""ok\"" taste.  Probably a once every 4 years restaurant for me.  Sakanaya will probably be no better.  We'll see."
2885	0	a	The girl working at the counter was very nice and explained the different types of ramen soup bases. The interior of the restaurant is clean and nicely decorated. I tried the tonkatsu ramen, which was disappointing. The texture of the noodles resembled that of spaghetti and the pork was tough. Save your money and buy a packet of Shin ramen--that's probably more satisfying.
2886	0	a	"I was really excited to try this new ramen spot on green street. However, after the first bite I was disappointed. I got the braised beef tonkotsu ramen. The broth lacked any pork flavor and none of the umami flavor you get from a truly good broth. The noodles were far too chewy and not tasty at all. The braised beef by far was the worst aspect. I was expecting the beef to melt in my mouth as it should have, instead i had to tear it apart and chew on it like a piece of gum. Definitely not what you want out of a beef that was supposed to be \""braised\"". I didn't come close to finishing my ramen and left Koto Ramen unsatisfied and disappointed. \nDon't waste $13 and go to Sakayana across the street for some much better ramen. Actually you're better off eating top ramen for better noodles and a more flavorful broth"
2887	0	a	Seriously the worst ramen i've ever had in my life. would you ever pay 12 dollars for maruchan?
2888	0	a	I am new to the area but I have friends that have been waiting for this place to open up forever. I'm going to break my experience down in this review.\n1. The ramen wasn't good. At all. The soup was oily and the base was bad. The noodles left much to be desired, and the flavor just wasn't there. Most of their ramens taste really similar. All in all it just tastes like instant ramen with some fatty meat thrown in. In fact, if it were instant ramen, I wouldn't have to pay an $10 for it.\n2. No vegetarian options and the staff isn't very nice about it. I have a friend that's a 'flexatarian' (a vegetarian with cheat days, occasionally) and he told me the staff was pretty snarky about it. All the soup bases are made from day old pork/beef broth.\n3. The ambiance is ok. The decor is cool but the tables are a bit too close together in my opinion.\n4. They aren't consistent with their service. My friend and I got the exact same meal with the same level of spice. I got a giant lump of what looked like straight Sriracha but my friend didn't get any spice at all.\n\nAll in all, can't recommend this place. It's only slightly less expensive than Sakanaya. You'll find a better bowl of ramen just about anywhere.
2889	0	a	Dang it!! Dang it!! I wanted to like it!! I really, really did!! But, their customer service was sooo lacking that I couldn't  enjoy the experience to the fullest.  \n\nMy husband and I went for dinner Saturday night after reading the positive reviews on Yelp. We walked in and didn't get greeted with warm welcomes.  We didn't even get acknowledged until it was our turn to order.  There were five people working the line and service was still slow. When it came time pay .. welll.. that's when the customer service got from bad to worse (sorry Mason).  A little acknowledgement (such as hi) and a smile goes a long way. My husband actually had to reach across Mason to get our tray of food.  \n\nI got the pulled pork sandwich with waffle cut fries and cole slaw and my husband got the brisket sandwhich with the jalape\u00f1o beans and waffle cut fries. Our fries werent ready when we got our food. We were told that when the fries were ready they would be brought out to us.  Sadly, they were never cooked and my husband had to go remind the staff that we were missing our fries.  One of the employees who brought out the fries gave us a coupon for a free sandwhich.  Thanks that was nice:)   I'm happy to say that the food was really good:) However, because I'm such a weirdo about customer service (I will willingly eat ok food with great customer service than eat great food with bad customer service). \n\nThe final straw.  My husband and I were sitting on the patio enjoying the beautiful fall weather when one of the employees went outside to smoke a cigarette.  We left because the cigarette smoke was so strong. :(
2890	0	a	"We were so excited when this finally opened as we go to Geisha House (next door) quite frequently.  Live very close  and are always looking for food options.  Well....the excitement was deflated the moment we stepped in this location.  We ordered a 65.00 order for take out. We had family in town from Ohio and was hoping this was the best option for all of us.   I did this online at 3 pm.  Requested pick up to be 6pm.  We arrived at 5:50 pm.  Stood at the register for literally 5 minutes before we were even greeted.  Not a \""hello, welcome\""?  The Manager saw us and seemed surprised that we had not been greeted.  There was a young gentleman working that was very apologetic and qutie pleasant.  Wish I could say the same for the Manager.  Told him we were there to pick up our order.  After leaving for several minutes, he returned to say they were out of chicken which I ordered.  Out of chicken?  Well...come to find out, he informed us that a large party came in earlier and whiped him out.   Wow.  So, we said to him, basically you gave away our order?  He offered another meat choice.  But of course, that would be expected.  Seeing as we had no choice, we opted for the turkey (which was underwhelming at the least).  He also \""threw\"" in another meat choice.  I would have much rather had the chicken we ordered 3  hours previous, but that is what he offered.  Actually, would have much rather received a discount off of our meal or at the very least a gift certificate to try to get us to return.  Well, that will not be happening, sorry to say.   I am in customer service and have been for many years, and this experience has to rate up there with the worst.  Can you imagine going to pick up your pizza and they say \""sorry, we gave your pizza to someone else, but we have this for you!\""  Have to say this is the first time we have ever experienced this in our lives.  Just had to laugh at this point.  Food was ok.  Not great, not terrible.  Hope they get it together or they will fail miserably."
2891	0	a	The food is not prepared fresh.  I ordered a full rack of ribs and they were obviously from different slabs of meat.  Some were ok most were dried out.  The ribs were too salty and are already coated in sauce you can not get them dry.  For sides I had the baked beans which were mushy and bland, and the green beans that tasted as if they were canned and from days ago.  A huge disappointment.
2892	1	a	GREAT BBQ!!!  Great smoke!!  Portions are fair for the price.  Visited many times.  Will continue to be a regular customer.  The review of their take out was shortly after they opened..  Give them a chance.  They have continued to improve as their staff has become more experienced.  Have been to numerous BBQ restaurants in the valley.. This Dickeys is right there with the best!!  Yummy!!!
2893	1	a	I have been to this place three times since they opened up and I have to say this is one of the best Chinese Restaurants I have ever been to. The food, the price, and the portion sizes are all great! You really get your moneys worth here. I like how whatever you order will be made new. My personal favorite is the chicken chow mein! I live in Chinatown Las Vegas and the food here is just as good if not better than any of those restaurants.  The inside is very comfortable, I recently had come on a Thursday night and they had the NFL playing which was great! They have a good loyalty program, if you buy 10 dinner combos you get the 11th one free so be sure to get your card stamped.The service here is amazing. The whole staff is friendly, everyone from the cooks to the manager! You feel welcome as soon as you open the door. The owner Mai and her staff do a great job! Alberto, Leon, etc are all super! Great food and great employees! This is a place you have to dine at!
2894	1	a	The cold buster shot does wonders! If you can be brave, it will make you feel much better!!!
2895	0	a	This is a new location and i understand it takes people a few days or weeks to get used to the new establishment. But, I think the staff should of been trained better in taking custom orders.\n\nI went here because its close to home in Anthem. And i was happy to see it open!!  Well that soon turned to despair. I Usually hit up the location on Las Vegas Blvd near the outlet mall and they are spot on with everything. Now i will admit i don't order the run off the mill combos from the menu.\n\nI Ordered a Caniac Combo No Slaw Extra Toast Butter both Sides with a Sweet Tea NO ICE. The Girl on the intercom seemed confused. She replied what was that? I repeated the order to her. She said ok thank you i will tell them no ice. Great im thinking they got it.\n\nPulled up to the payment window gave the girl my money and canes clubcard, she seemed nice but failed to return my clubcard. I didnt realize till i had already pulled up.\n\nGot to the pickup window and the lady was like 2, 3 piece combos? UH No LOL she asked ok what did you have? LOL ok at this point im like wow these people are idiots, So i just hand her the receipt  4 Minutes later she has my order. First she hands me a sweet tea packed full of ice when i specifically said no ice. Then she says she will strain it for me..?? STRAIN it for me? How about dump out the whole cup and refill it. What are you straining it with your hand?? So we get the food and i have to go back into the store to reclaim my canes club card.\n\nJust wow never had such an ordeal at raising canes. But after all of that the food was delicious and cooked perfectly. The cooks are doing a great job!! The butter both sides was perfect :)
2896	0	a	This review is of the new raising cane's off of st rose Pkwy. First time to this vendor. Went in to order but for takeout, since I had no idea what to get, didn't want to go through drive thru.. Got the 3 fingers combo, but wanted slaw instead of fries. No prob. Rest of family orders & we go. About 25 minutes later & get to work, & my order has fries, no slaw. Uggg, go back to place to remedy. Yes they fixed it but I' m now 50 plus minutes into this, & they gave me the smallest chicken strips ever. No sauce either. Thought it should come with sauce so that may be my fault. Chicken dry. Not impressed. Not going back...don' t know why the big deal about this place.
2897	0	a	"Maybe it's just me but, I think the fingers are DRY and not very hot  compared to the canes on Las Vegas blvd out by the Belz mall.  And, have alot of kids running the place. It's funny also, I asked for extra dipping sauce and the girl behind the counter goes \""HUH\"" I said huh? How about excuse me?  Lol.. Just my 2 cents!  Late."
2898	0	a	"Where to begin...I've been to the drive-thru four times. Each of those times, I was shorted one or more pieces of chicken. During my most recent visit, I informed the person at the window that I was missing one piece of chicken. She sarcastically remarked, \""Oh no, one piece of chicken?\"" That pissed me off so badly that I felt like showing her the longest finger on my left hand. Knowing that cooler heads prevail, I refrained from the popular symbolic expression. After all, how could I possibly be upset at someone who cannot count to six? Next time, I will show her how to incorporate the fingers on her other hand. She will be so happy to learn how to count to ten."
2899	0	a	I don't get it. Everyone I know, & I mean everyone, loves this place. But I just don't get it. Their coleslaw is watery, the fries are so so, and the fried chicken fingers are just that. Fried chicken fingers. Nothing special about them. The only time I eat here is when I am in a group of people and everyone wants to go and I don't want to be that one person that says no lol.
2900	1	a	This is my favorite drive thru fried chicken joint. The chicken is always fresh and their special sauce is amazing. Menu is simple since they only keep chicken strips, which makes things easy for customers, but drive through wait can take up to 10-15 minutes during busy schedule.
2901	1	a	If your a major chicken fingers fan then this is your spot. In general chicken fingers are not something I look for in a menu but I figured since everyone mentioned this place, I might as well try it. Luckily this one is close to where I live. \n\nChicken is moist and is probably one of the best chicken fingers I ever had. Usually at other places either the chicken is dry or the skin is too over cooked and ends up being chewy. A  big plus is it offers a generous amount of sides. \n\nWhy the 4 stars? I've eaten here at least 5 times the past few months and sometimes the chicken fingers are small. Service in general is good.
2902	0	a	So we go out to buy a car and visit a bunch of places. It came down to this place and an Exterra or something like that. \n\nSubaru won out by coming in at the price out the door including tax and license that we were willing to pay.\n\nI do not fart around with the back and forth nonsense one usually gets at auto dealerships. I state what I will pay and if they can do it fine, if not, I am out of there. To this point it was going as I wanted.\n\nI wrote a check for the car and off we drive. Two days later they call and say they lost our check, can we give them another. I tell them no, find it. They call again and this time I tell them if I write another check I expect another car. Finally I am in the area so I drop off a check, I just like messing with them. Two more days pass and the sales man who sold us our vehicle calls to ask if we have decided if we want to buy or not. I reminded him that we already bought a car from him. His response is, huh, um, huh, OK and hangs up. A week passes and he again calls to see if we are ready to buy. So once again a reminder is in order. in the week after we got about five letters to remind us they are still there when we decide we are ready to purchase a new car. Not once did they ever say thanks for buying a vehicle, thanks for bringing us another check.\n\nOh and if we show up for a service appointment they never know who we are. So I wonder if we had just driven the car off of the lot without paying for it, would they have noticed?
2903	0	a	I bought a new car at the dealership and did not notice that on the paperwork that I signed, there was a tiny box that had a check on used.  So they sold me a used car (that was definitely new....plastic still on carpet and only 250 miles) and so I cannot get the tax rebate that I had planned to get.  I called the salesman that I dealt with several times to talk about this and he expressed that he did now know how this could have happened and that it was certainly new.  Every time he said he would call back the next day and did not.  I try to believe the best in people but it certainly seemed as though I was being avoided and was scammed.  Of course Subaru will not do anything for me since I did sign on this paperwork.  I highly recommend that you DO NOT go here.
2904	1	a	Great service department, I brought my vehicle here and even checked out some Subaru's while waiting.  I did not know they built such a great car, I may have to pick one up soon.
2905	1	a	This review is for the service department for Camelback Subaru.\n\nFirst of all I decided to switch to Camelback Subaru for the Servicing of my vehicle after suffering through bad service and attitudes with certain advisors etc. at the Subaru Superstore in Gilbert.\n\nCamelback Subaru is a good drive for me from my home in the East Valley and after having a chance to have my vehicle serviced in the Subaru side of the business I am very pleased with the experience and outcome.\n\nCamelback Subaru Service Department did a number of things right:\n1. VERY courteous service advisor (KS) who explained options for servicing at Camelback Subaru when i called to check services after the bad experience with the service department at Subaru Superstore\n2. Received a call from service scheduling 1 day prior to my appt to confirm my scheduled appt AND to confirm that loaner car was available per my request!!! (If the Subaru Superstore would learn to handle a small detail like this they would be able to hold onto customers)\n3. Very courteous and efficient drop off of my vehicle and pick up of loaner. My Service advisor KS was really cool and was able to get all my info from Subaru Superstore and my warranty info input into Camelback system quickly.\n4. Received status update next morning from KS on service and was given option of waiting for a part for my vehicle and or keeping loaner and returning when part and vehicle were available and installed.\n5. It took a few days for the part to arrive due to having to be ordered from Subaru but KS gave me 2 more calls during this time to keep me abreast of status\n6. When vehicle was ready, KS spent some time reviewing repairs, reviewing what my warranty covered (it covered all repairs which was cool!) and reviewing other inspection results from vehicle. A review of inspection results only occurred once (out of 4 or 5 service appts) during time I was at other dealer.\n\nCourtesy and appreciation of me as a customer was very evident during the entire process for my vehicle servicing and was night and day different from Subaru SuperStore. Subaru after all only has 2.7 percent market share (vs 7.9% for Nissan/Infiniti or 14.4% for Toyota/Lexus) in the US thus you would think that all Subaru service departments would value their customers since there are so few of us...well some do..some dont....
2906	1	a	stopped in to check out the  Subaru Impreza's and spoke to Kyle C. who was knowledgeable, professional and took time the time to answer all my questions. He was not pushy and understood I was not purchasing today but have a feeling I will buy from him in the future. Customer service is a rare commodity these days. He explained all the services that the dealership provides and I even met Ian in the service department who was also wonderful.\nThank you Kyle, your manners are recognized and appreciated.
2907	0	a	It's so hard to find good service for my Subaru.  I was in because my radiator blew.  It was under warranty, so they replaced it, but left a big mess of green coolant all over my engine, which was clean before the radiator blew.  They didn't bother to hose it off before they gave it back to me.  They also failed to replace an engine bolt when putting the engine parts back together.  I've been driving around for nearly 2 months without the bolt that holds the engine cover in place.  So I learned to always check the car myself before driving away.
2908	0	a	Can't get rid of robocalls from the Service Department\n\nI bought my Subaru in 2010 and was reasonably satisfied with the transaction, though it took 3 days to get the car I wanted. Everyone was polite, which I attribute to the fact that I was buying through Costco. They sent me coupons for the first couple of maintenance intervals, which I appreciated. Then, instead of a coupon, I started getting automated phone calls reminding me that it was time to get the car serviced. \n\nThis was especially bad after the 30,000 mile service, because it's an expensive one. I got it done for $400 at Gab's (all genuine Subaru parts) instead of $600 at Camelback Subaru. I told them it had been done and asked them to have me taken off the robocall list. They didn't.\n\nIt's not every day but it's often enough to be annoying.  Starts to feel like harassment after awhile.
2909	0	a	While searching for a new Subaru my husband and I considered buying through this dealership because it was closest to our house in Scottsdale.  However after awful internet and phone communication, persistent pushing of used fleet vehicles on us when we wanted to buy new, rude sales associates when visiting, and unreasonable and inconsistent price quotes it was a no-brainer to go with a different dealership.  Even if this dealership had the best deal on what we were looking for (they didn't) I would have gone to a different dealership simply to avoid the poor service.  As another yelper pointed out, this dealership seems to forget that they are selling cars to actual people, not just selling cars. I felt like I was actively trying to buy a car but no one was that interested in making the actual sale.  We found the type of dealership and sales associates we were looking for at Chandler Subaru Superstore where I was given a competitive out the door price quote through email and it was honored with no gimmicks or add ons when we arrived at the dealership.
2910	0	a	"I am brutally honest when it comes to auto dealers and my purchasing experience so take this for what you will. I have purchased a number of cars in my life and I always judge a dealership by the people, the experience, and the deal. I purchased an STI here last week. \n\nThe People: The sales people are nicer than your average dealership and the pressure is probably low to average. I never felt uncomfortable or like I was anything other than a car buyer (though more on that later). Employees passing by would even stop and chat. The only person I wasn't all that thrilled with was the manager (I think he was the manager) who was brought in to talk me into being ok with all the add ons. NY/NJ accent. He was nice enough but it was the typical sales pitches and likely embellishments (\""it costs me this much and it's really for your protection...\"") to get me to sign. B+ on the people.\n\nThe Experience: Overall pretty typical. I actually went here by mistake. I was supposed to go AutoNation Subaru but I mixed up the addresses. As most car buyers do, I went in knowing what I wanted and got talked up into taking something else. I'm not terribly disappointed as I love the car but there's always that lingering spite of buying something you don't think was worth it. More on that in the deal section. We had to go back and forth a number of times on price because I had a dam good quote in writing from AutoNation. I was about to leave twice and of course they kept making me offers. Some insulting, others more reasonable. After the deal was said and done, the rest of the finance process was not bad. \n\nThe Deal: So here's the thing. Camelback Subaru...and I'm guessing a lot of other dealers put a bunch of dealer add ons and stuff that is WAY over priced and generally not worth it. Tint? Fine, that was only about $50 more than aftermarket but $600 for paint protection that I have no choice in rejecting? Door and handle guards for another $600? You can find them on Amazon for under $10!!! ZakTek? You can get 3 years of applications/coverage for $180 ($30/application every 6mo). Here's the thing, you want to sell all this overpriced stuff to people, give them a choice and let them know they have a choice! Hiding the truth is just as bad as lying to make a buck. As far as the price of the car...typical markup I guess. Well over what Subaru advertises online and in media. Just know that you can easily get them down by walking out. Never go look at cars thinking you are going to walk out the door with one. Always go in with the idea that you will buy one next week. Don't let the draw of driving away NOW cost you a few thousand. Do research and have quotes ready. Hard numbers for the base price of the cars you want, the car you are trading in, and if possible, an offer from another dealer.\n\nSome tips: Talk your way out of paying for any of the extra stuff they put on the car without asking you first. You don't want it and don't need it. The tint in AZ is probably the only exception. The paint protection...hell no. You can get that cheaper aftermarket...and it's probably only a warranty they are selling you. You have no proof that they even put anything on the car. The door guards are 99% marked up. The ZakTek is about a 400% markup. Don't even bother. As far as the second round of negotiating (in the finance office) reject everything. The only possible thing you might want is the extended warranty but first, check your insurance company. Geico offers mechanical breakdown insurance on new cars for a whole lot cheaper. It costs me $16 every 6mo with a $250 deductible each time I use it. Way cheaper on a new vehicle than the $2000 plan the dealer wants you to buy (and finance so you are paying interest on it). It's also an exclusionary policy so it covers almost everything.\n\nOverall, if you can get them to keep their overpriced add ons, this is as good of a dealership as you will find. Car buying, sadly, is of the few purchase experiences that hasn't changed at all in decades. Everything is stacked against you. Know that going in and also know that 90% of what you hear in a dealership is a half truth at best.\n\nUPDATE:\nSo a customer relations manager contacted me regarding my purchase and I explained all my concerns with the dealer package that I was forced to by. I explained that I was not happy at the value of the package and that I wanted at least a partial refund on the ZakTek and door guards. I was told that they would not work with me and that I was basically out of luck. Please do not purchase a vehicle from these people. Like all dealerships I have worked with, they rip you off with a nod and smile."
2911	0	a	My attempted car buying experience was not so great. They tried to throw on the Camelback buyer's package (unaffectionately know as the 'Camelback difference' by other dealerships) which depending on the mood of the general manager and how much money they think you're willing to dish out can vary from $400 to $1700.  It includes window tinting, some paint protection junk, some anti door ding junk and nitrogen in the tires which is a completely useless option. Try to negotiate all this stuff out and get the window tint thrown in for free.
2912	1	a	"When I started my car-purchasing process, I absolutely did not think I'd be writing a glowing review for a car dealership, but then I didn't start out at Camelback Subaru.  By the time I found Camelback Subaru, I was a pretty frustrated camper but I had no choice: my old car was going down, and I needed a new one - preferably a car that got great gas mileage and yet could take me and my Great Dane on all of our Arizona travel adventures.  (To me, for my budget, that meant Subaru, mos def.)\n\nA note about shopping. Shopping for a car is a special kind of shopping hell, not unlike going through Dante's Inferno.  I was doing my best to stay positive, but the first dealership I contacted was terrible.  They are slightly closer to my home, which is not a minor issue: I like keeping my tax dollars in my neighborhood and deplore the inconvenience of long drives to deal with car repairs.  But Tempe AutoNation lived *down* to my worst expectations about car shopping and car dealer culture.  I couldn't say goodbye to them fast enough, but I had this nagging fear that the experience would be the same anywhere I went.  So even though I wasn't optimistic that I'd have a better buying and service experience anywhere else, I decided to give another dealership a try before entering a long term relationship with a dealership that was clearly awful.\n\nI pulled up the Cameback Subaru website, found several possibilities of both new and used cars that fit my needs, and called to set up a test drive. To their immense credit, I did not get spammed with phone calls or emails.  I did not get any kind of \""upsale\"" pressure:  George Henderson, who managed all of the sales-related details, was just as excited about showing me the used vehicles as the new ones. Very helpful and no bluster - if he didn't know something, he'd ask one of his colleagues, all of whom were great. There was truly no bull here.  When I settled on the right car for me, I negotiated a very good price and some important extras - the \""We Owe\"" list was small but delivered in a timely manner, with great kindness, and with very little fuss. While there was a tiny bit of confusion when I showed up for my service appointment, Johnny Cuevas handled everything anyway, with no ruffled feathers (and a loaner car, to boot).  George stayed in touch with me throughout this whole process to make sure everything was on track for me, too.  This was a great place to do business.  Highly recommended!"
2913	0	a	I received by far the WORST haircut I have ever gotten in my life.\n\nWe got some coupons from their grand opening, but a $6 haircut just isn't worth it if you get scalped.\n\nMy son just wanted his hair buzzed, and they managed to mess that up too somehow. He required a re-do with my clippers at home.\n\nWe will not be going back.
2914	1	a	Reformed Central opened its doors on Monday! It is the second location for Reformed Pilates that started in Arcadia. The new location has 10 Allegro 2 reformers and 30 Keiser M3 Plus I spin bikes. They offer a mixture of high-intensity pilates, spin and 30/30 classes (25 minutes pilates and 25 minutes spin). If you live in the area you MUST check them out. 1st Week Unlimited is FREE for new clients.
2915	1	a	I am in love with the Reformed Studios! What I like most about Reformed Central are the combo classes! I took the Reform & Ride class yesterday and it was a great workout - it's the best combo of Pilates and cardio. Prior to coming to Reformed Central, I was terrified to try a spin class but who can resist a candlelit bike ride featuring great music!?! :) The class is intense & relaxing at the same time! I feel amazing afterwards. \n\nHats off to the Reformed team, they run a really well oiled machine! It's flawless!!!
2916	0	a	Gave this a try for lunch. Like the idea of the fast food mexican but found this a bit bland.\n\nFast service, okay prices. Service could have been a little bit more informative, never asked if we knew about any of their deals.
2917	1	a	Good food. Nice place friendly staff A++++\n Highly recommended. Right in the middle of old town.
2918	1	a	I noticed this lounge when I was looking at nearby places on Yelp! Since it's right in my neck of the woods I couldn't wait to check it out. When my good friend Carrie wanted to have dinner and catch up on a Friday night I suggested this spot. \n\nWe got there first and got a table. It was great we were immediately greeted and our waitress came over and I told her two more people were coming and we'd just start with water. I started to look over the menu as Carrie and her hubby walked in. The menu has lots of sandwiches and salads. It reminded me of almost a deli menu, but in a bar. Love it! Plus, all their meat is from Boarshead which I love as well. I was looking forward to chicken wings that I read someone say they had on Yelp. There were no wings on the menu. I decided on the pastrami ruben, but with no sauerkraut. Joel ordered the pastrami burger. Carrie had the pulled pork and her hubby Mike had the roast beef dip. \n\nOur food came out pretty fast. Only two things were forgotten our ranch that we asked for when we ordered and they put sauerkraut on my sandwich. A lot of it! But instead of saying anything cause I was so hungry I just scraped off what I could. I loved the grilled rye bread and the fries were really tasty. Plus, it was piled high with pastrami. I also loved that everyone got a huge pickle with their sandwich. Everyone else at the table liked what they ordered and cleaned their plates. \n\nThe staff was super friendly and did after we asked again bring us a lot of ranch. The decor is kinda modern and I love the view that all the windows give you of Water street. \n\nI'd definitely want to go back for their happy hour and for dinner again. Their prices are very reasonable when it comes to food. I didn't get to see a drink menu, but I heard they make an excellent Bloody Mary which I can't wait to try. Berwicks is a great new spot for Henderson locals.
2919	1	a	We walked over here to eat a late lunch after picking up some goodies at Flemming's bakery.  I had the chicken wrap with sweet potato fries and he had the classic burger with coleslaw.  Everything was really good.  Along with the check our waitress brought 2 ginger snaps - soft and delicious.  We will be back!
2920	0	a	I have been there twice now, didn't want to write a bad review based on 1 visit, especially since they just opened.   But after today definitely won't go back. Do not sit in a booth!  There are big crossboards poking through that are very uncomfortable. I had the lunch special,  a turkey and ham sandwich on a sub roll. Absolutely awful.  There was a lake of water/mayo on my plate after one bite that dripped out of my sandwich. The cook must have no experience. The two slices of tomato were hot, like fresh out of the microwave,  and ruined. My friend had their avocado BLT,  and the bacon was so burnt she couldn't eat it. But they gave us a $1.50 discount off of our bill. The waitress tried her best, but good service can't make up for lousy, over priced food. Probably an ok place to drink at. But I do not recommend it for lunch. Too bad, was excited for a new lunch place right by my office.
2921	1	a	"I have always like this place and now this location is finally open.  It opened a week ago and I still love the food!  While the combo plates might be priced a little high for some people, I think it is worth the quality and the quantity of the food.  I had the filet and lamb kabob combo with rice and greek salad.  My GF had the chicken kabob and filet combo with \""all salad\"" as her side.  These combos are $13.99 each, but I think worth the price.  If you like this type of food, I think you will like this place."
2922	0	a	My husband and I were working out next door and decided to try ZK Grill. He got done before I did so he went to order food. He  told me he didn't know if the hostess was trying to get a tip or hit on him. She told him, you have pretty eyes. He was taken aback by it and said something like thanks my wife seems to think so too. She proceeded to say oh your married, how long?  First off, don't appreciate her hitting on my husband. Her job is to take the order and collect the money. Second off, food was just mediocre. We had been told by friends from the gym that it was weird in there and now it's been confirmed.
2923	0	a	Subpar greeting and service first time they're terrible first impression we attempted to order 3 different items on the menu each time being told that they were out of that item basically leaving us with ground beef and chicken which i could go to any restaurant and gekeep in mind this was only 6pm on a Friday.  I came here because I wanted quality Mediterranean food which they could not provide I keep my business in Gilbert AZ that is my community and like to support local small business this place will not be getting any of my business nor recommendations we did happen to go 1 mile away and find a wonderful place called flaming kabob with the most incredible service and even better food I HIGHLY do not recommend going here as it is a complete waste of time
2924	1	a	We enjoyed a great night at Crave! \nThey had a pre-opening night, as their official opening is tonight. \n\nThe place is very pretty with a clean, well designed, modern feel.  Nice little outside seating area overlooking the beautiful downtown Sunmerlin mall landscape. Our bartender Chris was outstanding!  His Cosmos are made just right with a hint of a blush, not too much. We decided to call them Christini's as they are done so perfectly, grouping them in with run of the mill Cosmos seems wrong. Lol. \nWe requested our favorite Alien Tequila, & hopefully they will have it very soon. \n\nThe staff and servers were very nice & doing their best to give 5 star service.... getting everything out on time.   The food all tasted great... Medium rare came out perfectly for both the burger and the steak. The chicken was moist and tasty. The pork tenderloin  was very nice and Sea Bass was excellent.  Asian noodles were Flavorful & not too hot.  The Geisha-boat is a large Sushi boat and is stunning & the portion is very generous.  The sushi is a little spicy, but in a good way.  \n\nDeserts were Amazing!  The chocolate cake is not a sweet milk chocolate... It is a dark chocolate lovers desert.  Tiramisu is Fabulous!! Those two deserts were the highlights with our group. \n\nThe General Manager, Ryun Chastain was very nice... He has an impressive resume, including s long stint at Wolfgang Puck & he is very observant & service oriented. He came over to chat & check on everything. \n\nGreat New Reataurant with an upbeat vibe & really nice quality food.
2925	0	a	30 minutes to get drinks, (beer for me, and lemonade for kids).  This was very disorganized situation understandably being the opening day of downtown summerlin.  The food was above average actually so they get 2 stars when you factor in 30 minutes to get the first drinks, and almost 1.5 hours for food to arrive.  The complete disorganized situation negates the desire to return here.
2926	0	a	Crave! Such. A beautiful restaurant indeed. The service was fantastic except for the rude hostess. The food was incredible, I had a margherita flatbread which was phenomenal and ordered the turkey burger! It was absolutely delicious except for the fact when I picked it up a pool of oil/grease fell all over my hand in large amounts.... I couldn't eat the bun cause there was literally too much compared to the patty, and it was soggy!! but it was amazing! For fries, I recommend the gluten free and not the normal ones... Mine were stale and dry:(
2927	0	a	We just went to crave for lunch.  We were given a high top, which we asked politely if we could change, to no avail.  We felt like we were annexed to a time out seat!  The hamburger was rare, when I had ordered med well.  My husband ordered a noodle chicken stir fry, which looked and tasted as if it came out of a can!  Inedible!  We won't be back.
2928	0	a	We wanted to check out the new Downtown Sunmerlin with a very hungry appetite for much-needed food. We were told the wait at Crave was a 25 minute wait for a table. We put our names down. Granted, Crave was the only sit-down food place open. We waited 30 minutes and went back 2x thinking they forgot about us. Now, it was creeping up to an hour. We waited inside next to the over occupied hostess stations. There were a lot of tables open but, clearly not enough wait staff. After we complained again about our wait time, we FINALLY got seated. By now, it was well over the hour mark. Our waiter was prompt but then dropped a BOMB on us by telling us that the kitchen is backed up and that it will take 45 minutes to AN HOUR to get food!!!!!!! 40 minutes for appetizers!!!! We have literally never stormed out of a restaurant! You would think the 5-6 hostesses they had huddled around the one hostess stand would've warned customers about the kitchen wait time on top of making people wait for their tables!!! So, even if you had a reservation, you would've had to have waited a least an hour for your food, and this includes their sushi menu!!!! Unbelievable. Note to this establishment--make sure to either have enough employees to cater to the influx of curious people coming to check out the grand opening or, don't serve people at all, especially if you make them wait from lunch to dinner time! Unfortunately, I didn't get the chance to sample the food so, I can't comment on the menu items.
2929	1	a	Went for lunch with my girlfriends today...we all thought it was AMAZING!!  From the crab artichoke dip all the way to the end!  Betty took great care of us and suggested the angry dragon for our cocktail.  Talk about hitting the nail on the head!!  It was perfect with our meals.  I had the grilled chicken salad which was presented very well along with everything else we had.  Ended the meal with the individual salty caramel mousse.  YUM!!!  The only thing that made the meal from being perfect is that the website says happy hour is on Saturday from 11 to 5.  We were informed by the hostess that they weren't doing it for opening weekend!!  Bummer!!  We'll still be back!!!  Go quick!!!
2930	1	a	We stopped in on the opening weekend. It was predictably packed, but we were seated promptly for our reservation. We were incredibly fortunate to have Emily as our server. It was obvious she was very busy, but she never seemed rushed or flustered. She even managed to find the time to chat us up about my iPhone. \n\nI ordered a Paloma. Excellent. I had the bison burger which was the best burger that I've had. Ever. The only real drawbacks were the uncomfortable bistro-style stools and that it was ridiculously loud to the point that it was hard to carry a conversation. Other than that, a pretty good experience all the way around.
2931	0	a	Overall experience was not memorable. Took over an hour to get seated. After being seated took about 25 minutes to get my drink. Ordered Sweet Peach Ice Tea. Waiter kept coming back to table saying the bar was making it. About 4 trips. Finally after another 16 mins she said that they ran out. This place sells sushi but not that great. Food wait times are horrible. While I must say that the place looks fabulous and upscale, the presentation of food is below par. Sushi wait times are bad for a place that claims that has a sushi bar. The only thing I liked was that it was family friendly.
2932	0	a	Just left Crave right now in huge disappointment. . Chicken was super dry. Wait time was long but of course It is their 2nd day opening totally understanding. . \n\nTo MANAGEMENT: \nPlease teach your staff to be more professional. I was eating at the end of the bar. My wife ordered a roasted chicken and I ordered a sushi boat while I was eating by your well station you have servers and bartenders giving guest checks right next to my plate invading my personal place and i just couldn't enjoy my food. We have your long black hair bartenders giving out free drinks to these two guys. Gosh, mind as well give me some free drinks too while she and her friends talk over my shoulder! \n\nAdvice to everyone: please give this restaurant some time to improve trust me. The food quality and service is not worth the price yet.. But we shall wait n see..
2933	0	a	Made a 4pm reservation for the three of us including my 6 year old son. Still waited 20 minutes to be seated. Ordered an appetizer and they forgot to bring it out. Food was mediocre at best. Spent 90$ for what! I would never return to this place again. Don't know what all the rave was about Crave.
2934	0	a	For being open less than a week, this restaurant is horrible. 6 hostesses at the front telling us it is a 45min wait only to be seated in a restaurant that is only 1/3 full. The meal took an insane amount of time to be brought to us only to have soggy luke warm fries. Sushi was average but not memorable. Dessert (a small mousse cup) took nearly 15 min to be served and STILL had a shortbread cookie in it in spite of us being told it was the only gluten free dessert and us making it clear we needed it without the cookie. Since we had to leave (since the whole meal took twice as long as necessary) The waitress merely suggested it be removed from the bill since it could take another 20 minutes to put mousse in a 2in cup. Absolutely absurd. Looking around the restaurant at any time one saw waiters just loitering around....so they are clearly not under staffed on the floor , maybe the issues stem from the kitchen that isn't even prepared to serve to a restaurant less than half full. I won't bother returning.
2935	0	a	"My party of 4 was told there would be a 30 minute wait for a table. Since it was opening weekend that didn't seem so bad. The whole front desk situation was pretty disorganized and chaotic.\nWhile waiting, I asked to use the restroom and walked through a half empty restaurant which we were told was due to a \""shift change\"".\nWe were finally seated right next to the open kitchen and placed our orders. Plates that were out when we first sat down were waiting for a least 30 minutes before they were finally thrown away. In fact, by my estimation, at least (and probably more) than half of the food put out was thrown away because it sat too long. This didn't make much sense because there were tons of wait staff standing around waiting for plates that were never passed to them. \nI can't speak about the quality of the food because after an hour we never received our food. I had a hard time sitting any longer watching food get thrown away while we waited. \nCrave is the only restaurant open at Downtown Summerlin which seems like it would put them in a great position. If they don't get their act together then I don't see them still being open in 6 weeks when all the other restaurants open."
2936	0	a	"I went to Crave yesterday, 10.13.2014 around 2 p.m.  I was told a 45 minute wait when there were empty tables all over the place.  We ended up sitting in the bar.  The service was awful.  When the server Julie  did come over she was writing everything down on an OUTBACK notepad and when I asked if the restaurant was part of outback she said the restaurant was too cheap to supply paper for them to write their orders on so she was using the outback notepads.  Her attitude was less than professional at the start.\n\n I ordered the sandwich with chicken, apple and brie and when it arrived after about a 35 minute wait the fries were cold and chicken cold.  I asked the person who brought me the sandwich if it was suppose to be a cold sandwich.  He said Yes.  When the server came over I asked her and she said no and took the sandwich back.  20 minutes later when everyone else had eaten the sandwich came so I ended up taking it to go.  The manager came over and apologized and said he would be back in a \""few\""  never did see him again.  The bill came; it was wrong and when I mentioned it to the server instead of wanting to correct it she wanted to give me the cash in lieu of fixing the bill so I would pay the bigger amount on my credit card.  When I asked her to fix the bill she slammed it on the table and said it would take a while to fix it.  Let's just say that this experience was not good and it will be a LONG time before I would try this restaurant again.  Too bad because it has a nice ambiance but the service and food has to improve."
2937	0	a	Atmosphere: What a benefit to Crave that they are one of the only restaurants open during the opening of DTS. Crave feels like it's menu of Sushi/Burgers... Identity confused. The sushi smell will likely knock you over when you walk in the door.The hostess could use some classes on cordiality, and possibly look at you when speaking, let alone a smile. My family and I waited for 30min, to be set at the bar when there were open booths available, not the most comfortable. The hiring manager likes blondes with tattoos, that's clearly evident by the very attractive tattooed waitresses.\n\nFood: I was surprised that I had to pay for the bread basket (usually complimentary), but ok. The burger, well it had a patty. Now the flatbread apple sausage was totally worth all the BS that I had to deal with. Also, the crab cake (with salad) was pretty darn good. For desert, the smores brownie... Or the snores browie... \n\n\nNot really for the fam, Ironic since Summerlin (the target demo) is mostly families. I hope this place gets it together before any competition opens up.
2938	0	a	Don't go hungry. This place is slowwwwwwwww. Party of 5 last night. Watched my daughters COLD sushi sit near a heat lamp for 37 minutes before attempting to be served. Then when they did we refused it. Brought us another. Manager came over. Lady and I don't think she was a manager and just apologized. I felt very sorry for our server. She was working hard but the kitchen staff needs work yet. They opened way too soon. Won't try again until next year!! Save your $$$ on this place until they work the kinks out!
2939	0	a	Decided to give this new restaurant a try since this was just a few of the restaurants that were actually open for the grand openining of Downtown Summerlin. Sorry to say that my boyfriend and I were not impressed. The quality of food was something I would expect from Applebee's but with a 75% mark up in their prices. \n\nWe started off with the Aloha roll and the Pork Belly Sliders. The roll it wasn't anything special but for $15 I was expecting more and the sliders came on some hawaiian roll bread, it was just ok. My boyfriend ordered a their signature Crave burger, the meat patty was a bit dry and the fries were soggy. I ordered turkey BLT and I got somewhat of a flat bread sandwich, kind of threw me off. The smell of the bread was too dough-y, wasn't very pleasant.\n\nIn conclusion, we left dissapointed and unsatisfied. Probably won't be coming back.
2940	0	a	Front desk seemed a little confused and unorganized. We walked in at lunch time and left my name and number and was told that the table should be ready in about 20 minutes and that I will be receiving a text from them. We took a stroll around the area and went into a couple of the stores nearby to kill some time. 50 minutes had passed by and still no text. My boyfriend and I remembered that there was a BJ's across the street. We went there instead. No regrets (:\n\nI know that this place had just opened up. So hopefully they get it together.
2941	0	a	We sat at the bar and were given menus. Then we were subsequently ignored for 15 minutes after putting the menus aside. Customers around us were served multiple times but we were not addressed at all. They were busy, but there were 7 bartenders for 12-15 customers at the bar. There's really no excuse for the bad service. After futilely waiting for a few more minutes, just sitting and waiting, we left. I will not be returning here anytime soon.
2942	0	a	The family and I decided to check out this new restaurant because there seemed to be a lot of buzz around it. We stopped by for a late afternoon bite and walked into a crowded entry. The place just opened, why wouldn't it be packed in here! However, that was not the case, there were 4 tables and 2 couch areas opened on the outside patio and the bar area had only a handful of patrons. There were 3 women at the hostess podium who were engaged in their own conversation. It looked like they were trying to figure what they were going to do. There was no friendly greeting nor did they even acknowledge our existence. One walked away, another when to seat the group in front of us, the blonde in the white shirt (I'm assuming she was management since everyone else was in all black) continued to ignore us and stare at her laptop even as I walked up to her. Another girl came by and greeted us, I asked if we could be seated outside. She commented that we can but she's not sure if there were any open tables as she hesitantly went to go check. My Husband commented that there were open tables, she returned a minute later and directed us to the patio. \n\nOur server was friendly, however service was bad. It took a while for him to greet us, take our drink order, take our food order, and our food took 40 mins. If the food was good, the wait time could easily be overlooked. The food is MEDIOCRE AT BEST! Seriously, we travel a lot, we eat out a lot and we love trying new places, nor are we snooty food critics. We simply enjoy dining out and appreciate getting what we pay for.\n\nThe menu is all over the place so I had a hard time deciding on what I wanted. There's sushi, burgers, pasta, salads, etc. There's no rhyme or reason for the menu. I ordered a salad and added a grilled chicken breast, my husband got the crave burger and our daughter got the baked mac n cheese. Yeah, we settled for this because nothing else seemed appetizing and as much as we love sushi I'm glad we didn't order from here. \n\nAgain, the food was mediocre at best you can go elsewhere to get better food. The icing on the cake however was that THEY RAN OUT OF BEER! The server was kind enough to tell my husband that there was a possibility that they were out of Stella and make a 2nd choice just in case. The server ended up coming back because they were also out of his 2nd choice which was Miller Lite. Are you kidding me?? OH and did I mention, I also ordered a cocktail, some dragon drink. I don't remember the name of it nor can I comment on it because I NEVER GOT MY DRINK! I get it they just opened up, but you ran out of at least 2 types of beer at 4pm?\n\nThere's not too many restaurants open at Downtown Summerlin yet, until then go to the Red Rock Casino and enjoy better food and over 150 beers on tap at the Yard House!
2943	0	a	"These guys are lost.  Whoever trained this staff needs to be trained themselves.   We stood out front of hostess desk and told three people our name and reservation time.  3 different times they asked who we were.   At 715, 20 minutes later the ask a 4th time and say \""ohh we have been waiting on you\"". I said we have been standing here for 25 minutes.   She replies. \""Did u get lost, the place is hard to find\"".  I looked at her and said her and said ...I just told you we have been here 25  minutes.    OMG.   Ok now at dinner.   Ran out of kids cups crayons.    40 minutes now no salad.    Salads now have come but mine is missing.  I'm not going to say anything cause I want the torture to end    I should also state.   They are not even busy.       It's a thur night   Here is the deal.  I lived here for 20\nYears.  If this place near strip it may survive. But up in Summerlin. I give it 18 months and their gone.      Food was average"
2944	0	a	Our food took so long to come out. On top of that, it comes out and the order was wrong but I was too hungry and exhausted to complain. We paid $15 a plate. The service was very slow even though there weren't very many people in there. Definitely not worth it.
2945	0	a	Wait staff was really nice, but the whole place was really disorganized. We were brought to our table which already had people seated at it, then, it was right by the kitchen which was very crowded and the wait staff was clearly didn't know the layout of the restaurant yet. The beer they brought me was warm from the tap and the food I ordered was way too spicy and the lamb meatballs were overly dry. It will be a long time before I go back.
2946	0	a	This place is another sad case of a confused restaurant who, in trying too hard to be innovative and sexy with flavor pairings, and trying to catch all the food trends, has achieved nothing but mediocrity. Not to mention that for the same prices I can get the real gourmet version of what they are trying to do at a strip restaurant. My Mahi Mahi was over cooked , and had a bizzare banana and curry sauce. The sushi roll we had was edible...if you are the type that likes American AYCE places. The best thing was the burger, which was ok, but for $17 I expected better grade beef and more interesting bun. The service was good. I liked the waitress but In the end, I don't think I would come back. Too many other better places to spend $100 on dinner for 2.
2947	0	a	Haven't even tried the food or drinks yet but have been sitting in the patio after the host told us we can sit wherever and will be served. 20 minutes later and nobody will acknowledge us. I know the place is new but the service is the worst I've experienced in a very long time. Once more places open in downtown summerlin this will be last on my list.
2948	0	a	"Loud, Service sucked.  Waiter should have paid more attention to our food than trying to play nice guy. \nI asked for my salad to be served before main course and still have to wait after asking twice.  Of course half way through eating it down comes my dinner.  \nLet's talk about that. Had the chefs special steak and while it didn't taste bad it's was one step above cold. The Brussels sprouts were cold and hard, mashed potatoes tasted like they came out of a box\nNow let's top of the fact the server while I was still eating plops down to the others sitting at the table this \""sign up for points card\"" DUDE IM STILL FREAKING EATING HERE! Next he was plopping down the check.  AGAIN IM STILL EATING MY DINNER WHY THE HELL ARE YOU RUSHING US.  \nOh wait, now that you closed out the check did you even offer desert? \nI so can't wait for the rest of the mall restaurants to open cause business will drop there with service and food served this way"
2949	0	a	I ordered one of the sushi boats, and the sushi tasted like supermarket sushi. The boat itself was $26. They were probably one of the worst tasting sushi I've had in my entire life..... Fish was far from fresh, and the rice was definitely not sushi rice. My boyfriend liked their ribeye steak though so that was fine. Service was great. Just avoid their sushi at all cost....
2950	0	a	This place needs some serious help. First off the girls at the front were quoting waits despite that tons of tables were open all over the restaurant. They informed us that we could sit at the sushi bar with no wait so we sat immediately. Our server was quick with greeting and very friendly so she was absolutely not the issue with this train wreck. So here it goes first off the wine glasses weren't polished so they had water spots all over, balsamic chicken salad was mediocre and full of leaves with huge hard stems, servers seemed to be standing around hanging out and not one moved aside to give me the right away when I walked through, they had an entire section being used to polish silverware out in the dining room, managers seemed to not care about what was going on, oh and there was no seat covers in the bathroom. \nSo disappointed, I should've just grabbed a pretzel.
2951	1	a	"There are five things that I want to review my opinions upon this restaurant.\n1. WELCOME- Hostess was very polite, giving us a 30min. Wait time since this is the only sit down restaurant that's open in downtown summerlin mall.\n2. SETTING- Very nice furniture and lighting is amazing. It feels like walking into an Asian infused American restaurant, maroon and red and gold interior, you can tell by it's design that it's been very well thought through.\n3. CUSTOMER SERVICE- From the hostess and the waitress, they have been extremely polite, taking our drink orders once we sat and our entree orders as well. Time is a precious matter and no matter how busy they were, they helped us at any chance they get.\n4. FOOD- I ordered the aloha sushi roll and it was amazing, it had ginger and a sweet teriyaki sauce that meshed well with the raw tuna, my friend had the \""crave burger\"" and it was cooked just right medium rare, and the French fries had a great seasoning not just plain. \n5. OVERALL REVIEW- Great setting, customer service and food. Definitely coming back."
2952	0	a	"1) Front desk girls are TERRIBLE! 40 min wait at lunch with tables open. \n\n2) The servers are COMPLETELY CLUELESS! \n\n3) The managers look LOST! \n\n4) The bar is a constant mess and totally unorganized! \n\n5) The food is better at Olive Garden! \n\nDONT WASTE YOUR TIME HERE!!! \n\nI promise you will regret it!!! \n\nThey will be out of business by this time next year!\n\n\n\nLOL....I received a \""compliment badge\"" by someone from CRAVE and they tried to get rude because I left a negative review!!! Lmao!!! How about you educate your staff, instead of arguing with your customers! You asked me if, \""I knew how to run a restaurant\"" in your rant....I'm a JWU graduate...and I clearly know more than you! I had one of the worst dining experience in your establishment! You can look at my record here on YELP...I rarely complain! So please stop harassing customers Shawn and focus your time on improving your Yelp rating! \n\nThanks  lol"
2953	0	a	"I didn't like this place at all!!!! Service is awful!!!! Went here today sit at the bar... I was starving and ordered right away, menu was just handed to me and have no idea how the portions  are, the salmon salad was decent and I had some crab cakes for appetizer which came out together with my salad... The bartender didn't even ask how my food was, the guy next to me ask me \""how was the crab cakes\"" bartender was In front of me when I response \""it's really salty\"" and he didn't say a word!  Bad bad service...."
2954	0	a	Service is terrible. Had a drink spilled on me by the busser within 20 min.
2955	0	a	The food in this restaurant sucks had the sushi roll that was bland. Also had some cooked fish dish was was ok at best. The burger was cooked incorrectly and I had to return it. This place is nicely decorated. It was real noisy when we were there. The menu has too many food options they should concentrate on one type and keep the menu simple! $80.00 for  two people dinner and left disappointed!!! I'll take my money elsewhere next time!!!\n\nDefinitely won't be back to this place!
2956	0	a	Very very noisy ..... Did I mention it's very noisy ??? Almost have to yell just to speak to my wife who is sitting across from me... :-(
2957	0	a	Came here with a group of 8. Took 25 minutes to just get our drink orders. 6 out of 8 orders were incorrect. I ordered the steak medium and it came out well done and the appetizer soup came out after my steak???\n\nThe waitress was very nice but you could tell the the mess the kitchen was in was taking its toll on her and her customers.\n\nIt almost felt that there was too many staff working Friday night and they would just form these little groups and chat for 5-10 minutes and then go off and do some work again.\n\nLike I mentioned above most of what we ordered came out all wrong. Sushi orders were all mixed up, items we didn't even order were constantly being dropped off at our table. It was chaos and we pretty much rolled with the ouches and just had to laugh at how it was one thing after another. It was definitely one of the most bizarre dinners we ever had.\n\nOh and someone might want to let the hostess know she doesn't have to scream the large font headers on the menu to the patrons at the table when she seats them, I was near deaf afterwords and we could barely keeps ourselves from bursting out laughing.\n\n\n\n\nI won't be returning.
2958	0	a	"Here is my review of the restaurant. The decor is nice and modern, upscale looking but the food doesn't match the ambience. Portions are small and bland. Do not order Steak Sliders if you are hungry!! It's consider an entree/burger which looks like it should be an appetizer $14.95!! A White Castle burger is bigger than the sliders I got. The wait staff was decent and friendly which is why I gave 2 stars. FYI you'll be \""Crave\""ing that you had more food on your plate. Pass!!"
2959	0	a	Very slow service at 3pm even if it was after lunch hours....it took 30 minutes to serve my food, but manager apologized.....can you imagine if it is during lunch or dinner times.....food is mediocre and not worth the money.....
2960	0	a	Simply not worth the excessive time or the calories. Despite three separate reassurances from our waitress and two managers that a computer glitch was the issue, it took 2 hours for three people to receive some bland sushi (that was not what was ordered - and the spicy tuna roll contained lettuce?!) and the salmon plate. Chopsticks took another 10 minutes.  Each dish finally arrived - in separate 15 minute blocks - and was unremarkable, however, they comped the meal.
2961	0	a	HORRIBLE!!!! We get there and order our food...we ask for a bread basket and it cost extra. My son had hair in his food..When I told the waiter he said do you want me to take his food back to the kitchen???? I'm like did you really need to ask that question??? Then they bring my salmon and it is under cooked in fact just about raw. I told the waiter and while he's somewhat apologizing he spits on the table and keeps talking. We are like WHAT??.? So they bring my son out his food and a whole 20 minutes later they brought my food and I'm like keep it...we're leaving.  Prices and high. .\nService bad. ..\nI WILL NOT BE RETURNING!!!
2962	0	a	Terrible terrible terrible !!!! Food was horrible !
2963	0	a	I will never go back again! My husband and I went there for the 1st time; needless to say, we were starving. The hostess sat us down and nobody showed up to take our orders. We literally sat at our table for 12 minutes w/o any service. We walked out, but before leaving we stopped at the hostess stand. We politely told them why we were leaving. They stared at us blankly without remorse, and did not even try to stop us.
2964	0	a	Me and my friend made a reservation for this place. We were sat immediately. However, we were not greeted by a server for 20 minutes. I'm sure we could have sat for an hour without being greeted if I hadn't said anything. There were other people sitting near us and servers walked by us multiple times. It was obvious we hadn't been greeted, yet no one took the time to make sure we had been greeted. The manager never came to the table, however he told our server that we would get free desserts. By the time our checks came out, we were charged for our desserts. We asked them to take them off which they did, but it took a while before we got our cards back. The food was good, but not worth the service. I can't say I will be going back...
2965	0	a	The food was hit and miss the last time I ventured here.  The service was terrible and the reception was as bad as it can get.  3 minimum wage females with attitude.   I was at a movie and thought I would give it another try.   Hostesses are clueless. ..  the only reason they are busy is the other sit down dining are not open yet.  I walked out as they just don't know how to treat a customer.  No hello, no I will be with you in just a moment,  nothing but attitude.   They were too busy with their chit chat than doing their job.\n\nI predict closure if they don't fix the lack of service as MTO,  California Pizza, Wolfgang Puck and Grape Street will pull 90% of their current business.    \n\nOwner and Management,  make changes before you loose your investment.
2966	0	a	This place has so much potential. The service was good and we were seated right away. The crab and artichoke dip wasn't bad but the 2 bento boxes and the premium bento box were terrible. The panko shrimp was basically all panko. The sushi tasted fishy. I was going to give the place a second chance but when i saw the bill i changed my mind. For the price we payed and the location, I was expecting a lot more. I'm not saying that you shouldn't go and give crave a chance but, yeah i was a little disappointed.
2967	1	a	First time with my wife. Had happy hour and the Sushi and Kogi Beef Taco are wonderful. Great greeting at the door and wait staff was great. Being they are new they have a lot in training and they all seem very attentive  and professional. Beautiful Resturant.  We will be back. 5 stats guus. Keep up the great job. Will be back for my birthday on the 20th. Looking for a full dinner. Will post how that goes.
2968	0	a	"Let me start by saying that this place has been open a few weeks, ample time for a new restaurant to get it together. We went in the middle of the afternoon, so it was not busy. We were sat right away, and our waiter came out shortly after to get our drinks in. We paid the $2 for the bread basket, and while it was adequate, the stuff that was supposed to be crispy was soggy. Just, no. it really should have been free. The runner who dropped it off took the time to explain what each of the breads were, by touching each one! Wtf! We had to laugh. The menu is extensive and appealing, but, They were out of the sandwich my boyfriend ordered, which seems to be a theme in alot of other reviews. He settled on a burger that featured a foie grais butter, and i got the steak sliders, both with fries. As we waited for our food, we had time to look around the restaurant, It was not busy at all, and it was obvious because there were waiters everywhere, standing around and talking in the middle of the restaurant, one guy even stood in the middle of the restaurant and texted on his phone! Gross! Some food got dropped off at a table near us and we could hear the waiter say to another one, \""bet that food gets sent back, looked pretty bad.\"" Umm what? At least we were entertained while we waited for our food. Our food comes, and yikes, it didn't look good. My sliders were sloppily put together, the crispy fried onion strings were really pale and under done, the steak had no flavor and the color of it was... Unappealing. There was no detectable juniper mayo, and the buns were underwhelming. There were about 9 soggy greasy French fries on my plate, and the temperature of my food was Luke warm. My boyfriends burger was ordered at medium well, it came out well done, and the bun was burnt to a crisp. His fries were also cold and soggy. There was no foie grais butter to speak of, either. I felt really bad for our waiter, he must know how bad their kitchen is because he brought us out fresh fries without us even saying a word about them. \n\nWe left our waiter a nice tip, as it wasn't his fault, it is clear to me that he was trying his best despite a kitchen that doesn't seem to care.\n\nBottom line, this place needs to get it together quick, or it will be gone as soon as the other restaurants open. It seems poorly managed and the kitchen is a mess to say the least, zero quality control. For a $40 lunch, we would have had a better meal at 5 guys."
2969	0	a	CRAVE... I tried to enjoy this place...\nWe came in to Crave to kill some time before our movie.\nThis review has nothing to do with wait time...lucky for us there were two seats open  at their bar. The restaurant has a nice vibe...very comfortable. \n\nOrdered the Kogi beef tacos...\nThe food runner came out with the tacos and another entree looking a bit lost as to where to deliver it to. After realizing that it was our order, I told him we never ordered the second item so he hands it to the bartender who then passes it around the bar asking if it belongs to anyone. It ended up sitting behind the bar for the rest of the time that we were there. \nVery unorganized system they have going on...\n\nThe Kogi beef tacos itself was very bad. I took one bite and passed it off to my friend who eats anything and everything but even admitted that it was pretty terrible. The meat tasted as if it was marinated in butter rather than cooked with it. The bite left a very unpleasant greasy film like taste in my mouth. \nI will not be coming back to try anything else on their food menu.
2970	1	a	From the service, to the food, everything was fantastic!\n\nWe started off with the crab cakes for an appetizer along with the Godzilla roll. Crab cakes were fantastic! Sushi roll was 20$ but a fairly larger portion.\n\n I got the mahi mahi. It was to die for! A burst of flavor! It had hints of pecan and cinnamon on a bed of shrimp rice. My friend got the apple sandwich that came on pita. Very good, great for a tasty lunch. \n\nWe finished off with The tiramisu shooter, and the chocolate cake. \n\nEverything was excellent! We will definitely be back next time we spend our day in dt summerlin!
2971	0	a	Food was excellent. We ordered scallop shooters, lemon garlic wings, Bison burger and the Lamb meatball pasta. All had fantastic flavor, no complaints there. \n\nBut the service........ Terrible. \nFirst, we waited 10minutes after getting seated for someone to notice us.  Food took a long time to come out even if they were about half capacity. They served us the wrong food. I had to stand up to ask for water 2x. It was hard to get the servers to pay attention even if a lot of them were just standing around.
2972	0	a	Well my husband and I with some friends decided to ignore the recent reviews and try this new restaurant. We all thought let's give it a try and chance. We went for happy hour and at first it was ok. We ordered drinks and appetizers though our food came first warm we had to ask for our drinks ... A bit strange !!! Then we ordered  a second round food was cold and our drinks were not only total wrong and completely off with no alcohol and they served a martini in a juice glass !! Who does that !! The drink that was to be made with rum was served with a splash of whisky instead. Service was horrible had to ask for everything at least twice. Happy hour  for what you got is pricy and don't go in the bathrooms I had to rummage thru the storage units to find the toilet paper. To say the least if they don't get it together this Restaurant won't last !!! I expected a lot more especially from a new Summerlin hot spot.
2973	1	a	Just had lunch here and I must disagree with a lot of the reviews. \n\nService was spot-on. Waitress was great and very attentive. Refills for drinks constantly. \n\nLove the decor, environment, the total vibe. I feel really bad that so many people reviewed based on a brand new establishment and not giving them credit for just opening. \n\nFood was good: the bbq pork sliders with kimchi was tender and juicy. The chicken apple and brie sandwich was bomb. Such a unique flavor. \n\nWill definitely be coming back.
2974	0	a	At first we went, everything was perfect. The food was delicious, or so we thought, everything went well. The waitress messed up our orders but it was ok, not a big deal. We had to pay for bread which was kinda strange but again, not a big deal. Dinner went well and everything was alright. It's what's in the food that I question. My boyfriend and I and his parents we to eat there, we all ordered different things but idk something in the food have ALL FOUR of us diarrhea and tummy aches.  Boyfriend and I have been on the toilet for two days now along with his parents. This is really sketchy, I don't know how they did or what they did in the kitchen but I'm definitely never coming back. Awful explosive diarrhea and stomach aches. Spent $170 there just to get sick after. Very disappointed, I had really high expectations.
2975	1	a	I visited Crave for the first time tonight, and I have to say that it was a wonderful experience. The service and promptness was impeccable. Hayley was our waitress and she did a fantastic job, always making sure we were taken care of.
2976	0	a	Even after my wife and I (accidentally) made two reservations for 7pm we still had to wait almost 30 minutes to be seated. And we were seated in the Bar, not the restaurant. Okay so be it. It doesn't get any better though. The wine was rancid, the margarita was lame and the main course came 5 minutes after the soups and salads were delivered. It was a disaster and the worse part is the food was just okay. I so want local restaurants to succeed however Crave has some work to do if they are going to last.
2977	0	a	We were starving and since this was the only restaurant open, we decided to give it a try.\nFrom the moment we walked in, the hostesses were pretty clueless and despite many empty tables, they said there was a 15 minute wait. No problem we said, we will have a drink at the bar. There were three bartenders working, and the tall male bartender directly in front of us wouldn't turn around to ask me if I wanted anything to drink. He was too busy chatting to the other bartenders and slicing his lemons and garnish.  I was practically waiving the menu to get his attention but was unsuccessful. Luckily the hostess came over and said our table was ready. She brought us to a high top table in the bar area which was too small for me and my guest. I asked for a normal table in the restaurant area and she said no problem, but it will be another 10-15 minutes. Ok, I will try to get that pumpkin spice Ale that I was thirsty for. Still unsuccessful in getting the bartenders attention (he is really focused) the hostess comes back and seats us at a booth in the back. On the way, I told her about the problem with the bartender. She just smiled and told me to ask my server for a beverage. She was totally unaccommodating.\n\nThe server came and she was great, so no real complaints about her. I did notice however that most of the servers came and went like waves. I mean they would be all over the tables and then they would all disappear for  7-10 minutes at a time. I mean no service staff at all in the restaurant. \n\nThe appetizers came and they were fantastic. It took about an hour for our entrees to make it to the table, steak salad and burger. Steak salad was great, however the french fries on the burger plate were soggy as a sponge. So they were sent back and replaced. When I went to eat the burger, the bottom bun was saturated from grease. In fact, the hamburger was sitting in an oil slick puddle of grease. Pretty gross. The manager came to the table after speaking to our server about the issue after about 10-15 minutes. Seems there were some problems with their Point of Sale system and he was concerned with that issue. He took the burger away and he replaced it with a sandwich which was more of a wrap, and it was tasty. He replaced the replacement fries as well again as they were just as soggy as the first if not more.\n\nThe acoustics in the restaurant are not very good either, it is very loud inside. Very much like a sports bar. Good luck having a conversation.\n\nI know this restaurant just opened, but I expected more from them. I would be willing to give them another try, but it wont be any time soon. Hopefully they will still be in business by the time I do decide to patronize them again.
2978	1	a	I just went there there for lunch today.  The food was good and it was a great price.
2979	0	a	Came here with the mr. for an early week happy hour.  Our server was nice but our food was ready before our drinks.  We had the pork belly sliders, tuna roll, and philly roll.  The food was meh, who puts lettuce in a philly roll?  Good luck keeping customers when all of the resturaunts are open.
2980	0	a	Being the only place open in Downtown Summerlin we were kind of forced to try this  restaurant out. \n\nThe atmosphere was alright, it was your typical chain restaurant bland atmosphere.\n\nI know I can't give 0 stars but even if I could I would still give 1 star because our server, Victor, was fun and knowledgeable. \n\n I LOVE sushi and was excited to see that they had a menu that was relatable to sushi and non sushi lovers. I ordered the Mexican Roll and a side of sashimi. I was super excited because i love anything spicy. I ate the majority of my roll because it was good! Everything was going great until early the next morning when I felt extremely sick, as did my other friend (who also got the sashimi).
2981	1	a	We walked in and asked for outside seating, got it right away.\n\nWe ordered drinks and our food after about ten minutes, I feel like that is a normal wait time. Our waitress was running around I could overhear other tables being quite needy (as in can you move my umbrella I wanted to sit outside but not deal with the sun or the heat or the birds ha) \n\nI asked for a recommendation on which fish dish was better in her opinion and she recommended the salmon but warned me about the mustard flavor. Honestly it was delicious so kudos. \n\nI think people need to give the place a chance it's just opened give it awhile to work out the kinks.
2982	0	a	Sushi was ok.... Very fishy taste for some reason.....Serivce however was great.... The drinks served were horrible.... Probably would not recommend..... Next ...
2983	1	a	When can a steakhouse be great and great sushi? When it's Crave!  Great filet mignon, delicious tomato basil soup! Husband got sushi and it was delish!!  I recommend this place!
2984	0	a	"After my 81 year old mother prepared our Thanksgiving meal I decided to take her out last Saturday to relax and enjoy a good dinner. The $5 cup of black bean soup was fine, however after that, things got bad.  We ordered the \""steak\"" sliders as an appetizer.  They were a sad shade of gray, tasteless, tough and luke warm.  Couldn't figure out if it was salisbury steak, or something more sinister.  $15 for 3 of these monstrosities was criminal. The calamari was tasty, but skimpy, and again luke warm.  The caeser salad was bland, with absolutely no flavor, and next to no dressing.  \n       Ordering the 'signature' rib eye for the main course was another huge disappointment.  $31 for a steak 3/8ths of an inch thick is absurd.  I don't think they are getting nervous at Del Frisco's.  After all this mediocrity, we decided to skip desert at Crave, and purchase some items from the nearby Trader Joe's.\n      The highlight of the meal was the desert from Trader Joe's.  I am not a malicious person, however I need to warn other yelp fans about this $155 fiasco.  For that type of money we could have had an outstanding meal at the nearby Vintner's Grill or Honey Salt."
2985	0	a	The cheesecake is amazing. Everything else was an expensive disappointment. The service was lackluster, the food uninspiring.
2986	0	a	The few times we have been there have been a mediocre experience.  I was expecting more being one of the anchor restaurants for the Downtown Summerlin mall.  Maybe it's just because they are working out the bugs.  The food is decent and presented well but the service is a little off still.  We've been there a total of 4 times and will wait to try again in the future when they have some more experience.
2987	0	a	We were at this restaurant about 4'ish on Monday afternoon during happy hour.  I ordered the Kobe tacos as an appetizer and they were so spicy I could hardly eat them.  My girlfriend ordered the roast chicken w/salsa and specifically asked for no halopenias.  The meal came out spicy hot.  Upon complaining to the waiter, who was also the bartender, we were given the bill with no apologize or reduction in the amount.  Although the restaurant is very quaint, customer service needs to be improved. We will not be going back to this facility.
2988	0	a	This midwest chain recently opened in the new Downtown Summerlin complex. It claims to be chef driven -- and maybe it is -- but the quality and execution is on par with similar chain restaurants. The duck confit flatbread ($15.95) was one of the more interesting sounding dishes, but there wasn't enough duck to balance out the sweetness of all the fig marmalade. The lemon garlic wings ($13.95) were huge, but the heavy lemon flavor made them unappealing. The Crave burger ($13.95) wasn't bad. It's a simple burger made up of an angus patty, smoked cheddar, lettuce, tomato, onion and their signature burger sauce. The undercooked and under seasoned patty were the only thing holding it back from being a decent burger. Desserts fared much better. Although for someone with a sweet tooth like mine it's tough to screw up chocolate cake ($7.95) -- five layers of dense, moist, sweet chocolate cake. It was, however, lacking a sufficient amount of the orange creme anglaise mentioned on the menu. The S'mores brownie ($7.95) had some enticing elements like the chewy brownie and the marshmallow ice cream, but the amount of torched marshmallow topping the brownie was overload.\n\nWith so many other places in town to try, I'm not sure I'll return. Sure, they have a large menu, which also includes sushi but the combination of that and American food in the same restaurant is an even bigger deterrent to my return.\n\n2.5 Stars
2989	0	a	Came here tonight for a company dinner party , and too put it nicely it was nothing special , their menu is very random from sushi to burgers to pasta . I ordered the rainbow roll and the fish was okay again nothing amazing very similar to sushi from a grocery store and for the price defiantly not worth it I also ordered the albacore nigiri and that was a huge disappointment, a coworker ordered the Godzilla roll it was so big and tasteless too much work for a blain roll , onto the burgers the bison burger was served literally burnt and the fries were over salted ,the lobster linguini was flavored good  but for the price you get 1 1/2 claw very tiny  and a very small portion of pasta that was undercooked lastly another coworker ordered the gluten free chicken salad (a plus this place has a gluten free menu) so you really couldn't go wrong with lettuce , we also had to constantly ask for refills mind you our group was only 9 people very disappointed . It's such a great location and very nice place itself but the food just isn't up to par
2990	0	a	We went here for dinner a few weeks ago with another couple and everything from the time we get their was poor--they sat us 20 minutes late, everything that all of us ordered wasn't good, the atmosphere feels like a chain and there are many other places on DT Summerlin to eat at.
2991	0	a	I took my husband here for his birthday with my daughter. We were seated and they only brought us two waters. They brought us another water and took our order. I asked for the dressing on the side for my salad and when it came the dressing was drizzled on the salad. The food is pretty pricey and the fish is not fresh. My daughter had the California roll and it was $9 for 6 little pieces. The imitation crab was dry and the roll did not hold together. Our bill came out to be $100 with some other things. But other than that the server was nice and helpful.
2992	0	a	Dining review: CRAVE Downtown Summerlin\n\nFood was ok. Service....SUCKED. It was only 3pm and not busy. Waited approx 10 minutes to get seated basically since they were waiting for the new shift of staff to come in. Waited at our table for another 15-20 minutes for a server to arrive. We had plenty of time to figure out what we wanted so we did drink and food order at the same time. Drinks arrived (we only ordered water and never were given refills)....then waited well over 30 minutes for just a turkey burger and chicken stir fry to show up. We saw our server only 3 times in the hour we were there and had to almost tackle him to pay attention to us to get our tab. Manager walked around a lot and was on his cell. Not a good view when people are waiting for food or have that look like they need assistance but no one is showing up. We weren't the only table that seemed to be forgotten. Staffing needs some work and management could step up and help out more as well in my opinion. We probably won't be going back.\nTurkey burger was average and the chicken in the chicken stir fry was thinly sliced like it could of been used in a chicken sandwich or BLT style sandwich.
2993	0	a	I had the bison burger with pork belly. The pork belly was under cooked and I got severe food poisoning, which worked out great since it was Christmas eve. I had the worst holiday ever on the toilet.\n\nBesides the food poisoning, the menu is all over the place, the ambience is nothing special, and the food is a bit over priced. I hope this place goes out of business ASAP. Oh, the server took 15 minutes to get my beer as well and they weren't even packed.\n\nThis place is GARBAGE.
2994	1	a	My wife and I have been here twice now, and the food has been fantastic both times.  That said, we were even more impressed with the service.  The first time we were here, the waitress was incredibly knowledgeable about the menu, which always makes ordering much easier.  The second time we came because we received an email about a four course meal being offered 26-31 December.  We came on the 26th with the intention of having the four course meal, but as it turned out, this location was not prepared to offer the four course meal until the 31st.  We were bummed, but stayed anyway and had a great meal which was comped by the manager Jamie.  Excellent service all around!
2995	0	a	If you know ANYTHING about food, don't eat here. The food is mediocre at best. Service is great though.
2996	0	a	I really wanted to like this place, but was EXTREMELY disappointed! The server was clueless and gave us the wrong information. Ended up moving tables because sat by cold front door area. Waited for service,\nbut server never came back. Moved to bar and totally regretted that because the bartender was soooooo rude. Very short w us when he took our order like we were completely bothering him. We observed him with the other guests and he was the same way with them. Our food came out wrong and he blamed us! We showed him what we ordered on the menu and what was supposed to come, but he got defensive and was almost fighting with us. So crazy!!! I have worked in the hospitality industry for 15 years and have never seen anything like it. I will never go back to this place and will advise anyone who asks not to bother trying it. They need to start fresh with staff that is competent and actually want to be there. Your food can be great, but if your service is terrible, your restaurant is doomed to fail miserably...but the food was mediocre so good luck...
2997	0	a	Terrible service and terrible food.  It took the 1 hour to deliver food to our table and 20 minutes for 2 glasses of water.\n\nWould never recommend to anyone, a total disappointment.l
2998	1	a	I was amazed as soon as I walked in! The hostesses were very welcoming and enthusiastic. The waiter had so many great recommendations for their sushi and sandwiches. The food arrived in a timely fashion, the prices maybe a little high for some but it's well worth it.
2999	0	a	Crave - a strong desire/ yearning for something (usually food, experience). \n\nThis was one of the first few restaurants that opened in Downtown Summerlin and I remember this place being so busy it was so hard to get in. My sister made a reservation for lunch. A few friends of mine warned me about the taste of the food but it was too late and I'm pretty stubborn.\n\nI just had a great shopping trip at my favorite store nearby. I was happy. We walked in and the host took us through a maze of high tables and high chairs. Did you not see my big shopping bags and yoga mat I was knocking things on the tables with? Why would you seat us at cramped tables when you have booths available? Lack of perception and care. Woosah!\n\nCRAVE Grilled Chicken Salad:\nCandied walnuts, goat cheese, field greens, grilled chicken breast with balsamic vinaigrette. I was leaning towards the Baby Kale and Steak Salad but this had the place's name in it so, it must be a must-have item, right? Not really. Everything that does not require cooking was ok but the chicken was dry. 2/5\n\nNorwegian Salmon Salad:\nCouscous, salmon, quinoa, pomegranate, pickled grapes and wilted spinach. The chef must not be good at checking for meat temperature and doneness. The outside of the fish was cooked but a big portion of the core was not. The manager got involved and offered another piece of cooked salmon. Why can't you just get it right the first time? 1/5\n\nNigiri:\nMy sister got salmon and escolar (super white). I didn't have any. The cuts looked good and the fish seemed fresh. I won't ever touch escolar due to its natural laxative properties - I don't need that!\n\nI normally would try to be understanding of things. Mistake after mistake...after we were done, I was yearning for my bathroom. I had plans to continue shopping with my sister but I had to go. I guess it didn't matter if I ate escolar or not, the food here has the same effect. I don't CRAVE for pain and suffering that's for sure. Holy borborygmus, I gotta go!
3000	0	a	I have tanned in their versa spa four times with a 5 time pass. This last time they upgraded me to the bronzer (normally a $10 up charge) they did give me that for free because I stated I didn't get any color the previous times. This time was not much better. Barely a darker color for around three days, then gone. I don't know if it's the formula they use but regardless, I wouldn't spend any more money on their spray tan machine.
3001	1	a	Newly opened in the Paris hotel in Vegas. Service was very attentive and friendly. They are totally on top of it. The food is amazing and authentic. We started with the spicy won tons in a spicy szechuan sauce. Very very good. Almost as good as my favorite Taiwanese place here in Irvine, A&J. I had the Taiwanese beef noodle soup - a classic. It was perfect. The broth was piping hot, rich, mildly spicy, and had the perfect amount of grease slick on top. Yum!!! The beef was superb and perfectly tender. Basically melted in your mouth. The noodles were perfectly cooked and stayed firm. My boyfriend had the dumpling soup, which was mild in flavor but very satisfying. He really loved the dumplings. They were big and plump with meat. It was the perfect cure for our hangovers. We'll definitely be back.
3002	0	a	The worst chinese Japanese food ever!!! Waitress rude from China and refused to speak Chinese! Noodle are not fresh and price for ramen is outrageous! Almost forgot dim sum price - get your platinum card out!
3003	0	a	I was too lazy to leave the hotel and was craving for Asian food so I decided to try this place since it was convenient.  This place has only been open for a month and it averaged 4 out of 5 stars on Yelp.\n\nThe wonton soup was very salty and the shredded chicken with ginger sauce was lacking flavor.  The Dim Sum dishes were average but at $6-$8 per Dim Sum dish, it wasn't worth it.\n\nOverall, come here if you are desperate for Asian food and lazy to travel to Chinatown (which was our case).
3004	0	a	Love to try Asian Food at Yongkang Street. But so dissapointedly, service was slow, Hongkong noodle soup was so so salty, dimsum was dry and fried rice just tasteless. Waiting for 5 minutes just for the chnage which short 2 dollars. What a waste of money and time to be at such a nightmare place to eat. Never come back or recommend.
3005	0	a	long story short, absolutely no reason to go here over noodle asia in the venetian.  \n\ntawainese beef noodles was pretty weak.  broth was lacking.\nwonton noodle soup, same story.  weak broth, only came with 4 wontons.\ndim sum was subpar.  we tried the bbq pork buns (dry) and the har gow which fell apart.\nthe steamed dumplings were clearly boiled, and they didnt have the mango dessert which was on the menu.
3006	0	a	#7 Dandan noodles were ok. Little flour taste to then. Over all ok. The manager shoved me and called me am asshole after waiter spilled and broke glasses on the person I was dinning with!  He could use some anger management courses.
3007	0	a	I greatly encourage everyone to avoid this establishment. We had an awful experience here. We came to this restaurant hoping to have some really good food. Unfortunately, that is not what we received. We ordered the BBQ beef noodles, plain beef noodles, and chicken dumplings. Everything was just awful. Our soups had a fishy taste, and the noodles absorbed this old fish taste. The broth in the soups was awful, and reminded us of bland won-ton soup broth. The service was also a bit off. Our server was fine, but the lady that comes around with the cart of dim sum was very rude. She did not try and communicate to us the individual flavors available. Instead, the woman pointed at the various dim sum and stared at us. We tried to ask what flavors were available, and she spoke to us in Chinese. We will never be back. Avoid!
3008	1	a	Good food, nice atmosphere and well priced. Even had veggie ramen options, plus all around.
3009	1	a	"Had a few random dim sum dishes as well as the beef noodle soup. Service was fast and though not perfect, pretty good for a \""Chinese\"" restaurant (as others mentioned, they serve a mix of Cantonese, Taiwanese, and even Japanese inspired dishes).\n\nDishes are all probably about 2X as expensive as they would be outside of the Vegas strip, but that just comes with the location.\n\nWould add that the server did hover over us while we were trying to write in the tip on the receipts instead of waiting till we were gone to pick it up."
3010	1	a	Awesome place - dumpling and pasta. The soups are delicious. I definitely recommend this place
3011	0	a	"We didn't get to eat here so I'm not going to be able to comment on the food but my comments are just about the reservation system and the hostess. I made a reservation on Open Table. When our plans changed, I tried to cancel. I could not cancel on the Open Table site, but it did give me a phone number to call Yong Kang Street directly. When I tried to do that, there was a recording that said that the mailbox was full.....\""goodbye\"". I didn't want this negative item on my Open Table account so the next day when we were in the area, I stopped at Yong Kang Street to talk to someone. The hostess informed me that they were not taking Open Table reservations, even when I showed her a copy of mine with the confirmation number. She also said that the system was down and she could not fix my reservation. Huh? Are they taking reservations from Open Table or not? I informed her that I tried to cancel my reservation by calling the phone number that was provided and she suggested that I discuss that with the manager. UGH! We won't be eating there, even if it's good if that is the way that they manage things."
3012	0	a	This establishment should be closed. It took over 45 minutes to receive our order of soup & noodles. After the extensige delay they forgot to give us spoons which took another 3 requests and 15 minutes to get. Once we were able to eat the noodles they  weren't cooked all the way. In the end this was one of the worst dining  experiences I have ever had.
3013	0	a	Honestly, this place is overpriced. The food isn't anything grand, and I know for a fact I can get better tasting food for a lower price down in Arcadia. I expected this place to be better because of the crowded wait and the (one) dim sum cart rolling around. It's better to wait longer for good places like Mon Ami than to resort to here.
3014	0	a	Two and a half stars for this noodle and dim sum place located in Paris. (Read below for more info why it he review is 2 stars and not 3)\n High traffic area and average food.\n\nNoodles: just as anything you could find in a typical chinese restaurant off Spring Mt road. \nBroth: flavorful but overly salty.\n\nOne more thing, staff told me I could earn Total Rewards points by going to TR counter. That didn't work out.
3015	0	a	I have been to a lot of asian restaurant and the food here tasteless for the price at least the dim sum is ok but still over priced.  Service charge is immediately added for group of 5 at 18 percent when service is awful.   I think Paris Hotel should evaluate this restaurant.
3016	0	a	so expensive... And salty and force me to pay tips without telling me in advance?! What do you expect me to say?! I will never ever come here again!
3017	0	a	Its gross! Their dim sum is nasty and hard! Their noodle soups are so so. Not that great.
3018	0	a	It's really surprising how bad this place is considering how good it all looks. Everything is severely overpriced for what you get. We came here the morning after celebrating my birthday on the Strip, so we were trying you cure our huge hangovers. To me, this usually means that I stop becoming picky with food and eat everything in sight, but I couldn't even stomach what I bought. There's only one dimsum cart roaming around the place, and the cheapest thing you can get from it was like $7 with a typical dimsum serving size. Siomai was dry and nothing special; rice was too dry to eat with chopsticks and felt hard. My friends ordered some sort of chicken over rice bowl. It was apparently bland and soggy, and it was definitely not worth the $15 they spent. I bought 3 things off the dimsum cart and spent $30 (read: ridiculous).\n\nConclusion: Pass. Go to Chinatown for much better dimsum. It's like 10 min from the strip.\nJanuary 4, 2015
3019	0	a	To be fair we ate there the first day they opened so there was a lot of issues. The A/C was not working properly so it was hot and steamy...maybe they were trying to replicate summer in New Orleans but it did not make for a pleasant dinner. Service was ridiculously slow and they could not get the credit card machine to work so we ended up paying cash after waiting nearly 40 minutes to track down our waitress to find out what the hold up was. Food was ok...crab cakes were really good but the rest was mediocre.\nSo I went back a few weeks later and they still have issues with the A/C. Service was better but not what it should be. We asked for bread and it did not come until nearly the end of our meal. Eek!\nHad the crab cake again...I really liked it. My husband thought it was so-so. The shrimp and grits were amazing. Our son had the Crawpuppies and they were bad...none of us enjoyed the over cooked, fried mess. The gumbo was yummy and our son also enjoyed the red beans and rice. We tried Bananas Foster for dessert and hubby loved it, son and I thought it was just ok. Their wine selection by the glass is miserable. Overall there were a couple stand outs but not worth going back for.  Maybe they will get their act together as we were hoping to get a really good new restaurant in Summerlin. I'm still over the moon about Jacques in the Trails in Summerlin.
3020	0	a	Very disappointing.   We read from previous reviews that the service was questionable.   Well that was true.  Waitress approached us 10 minutes after being seated.   The beverage menu was presented in a vanilla folder with stains on the pages.   When my wife asked for a glass with her beer, the response was we don't have any clean glasses but I will do what I can to find you one.   A clean glass was delivered several minutes later.  About 30 minutes after sitting, we had not yet received any food, so the waitress asked if we wanted some bread to tide us over.   When dinner was finally served, 5 of the 6 people in our party expressed how salty (I mean way over salted) the food was.  Lola came out to our table to ask how the food was and we told her ... salty, very salty.   Besides having slow service, the wait staff seemed confused as if they were out of sync.   Sorry but I will not be going back, too many things went wrong and the food quality was only OK.
3021	0	a	The food is par to sub-par in quality. It was sloppy and rushed and in no way memorable. We were excited to have a nicer local restaurant so close by, but this was so blah-I don't know I would be back. \nHowever, the banana pudding was pretty good-I'd try that again but nothing else to write home about.
3022	1	a	First off, our server Lisa was fantastic. She was really kind and patient, as it was our first time in. \nThe bread they brought out (right as we sat down thank goodness because we were starving) was to dieeeeee for. Maybe I was just starving but dang it was good. \nI got jambalaya, which is one of my favorite things to eat. I hate to sya this but I didnt LOVE it, I liked it. It was just a tad dried and not super flavorful. Whatever. I'll try something else next time. \nOn to dessert where it all ended well, it was GREAT. Love the apple bread pudding, so good. \nI will return.
3023	0	a	Visited soon after the place opened on September 19th. Was really excited to have something different near the house.When we got there we noticed that it was really hot inside. We had previously made reservations and requested a round table. Hostess proceeds to take us to a long table that had more chairs than what was needed. We asked the hostess if we could please be seated at a round table as requested. After 5 minutes they took us to a back room that had the round table. This room felt even warmer but we didn't want to leave since we were all hungry. The good thing is that they had fans. Ordered 3 cocktails and 3 waters and it took the waitress 10 + minutes to deliver the water and cocktails. To top it off she had to carry it all because she didn't know how to use a tray. I know they had tray's because I saw other staff using them. As for the food, it was not good. Maybe I should have waited for them to get the kinks out. Might give them one more try just to see if what I experienced was because the place had recently opened.
3024	1	a	This place is so amazing I'm writing this review while I'm still sitting at the table. Hurricane. Shrimp and Grits. And the Pumpkin Bread Pudding (seasonal). We will definitely be coming back here. Sooner than later.
3025	0	a	Very disappointing Louisiana style food, especially at these prices. I tried the Gouda Grits, which were mouth puckering salty. I tried the gumbo, which was a tiny little cup, and very bland. Seriously, if you need to know where to get some decent andouille sausage, I can show you. The red beans and rice was bland as well, probably due to the flavorless sausage again. I won't be back; I can get better gumbo and red beans and rice out of a box.
3026	0	a	Don't order the chicken strips.  Smallest portion ever for 10$.  Menu also needs more diversity
3027	1	a	I love it here. They allow me to tweak a dish. . Swapping the rice for gouda grits. And the house dressing is wonderful.
3028	0	a	the food is comparable to the Charleston location.  it's ok.  the ambiance is pretty lame.  finally, I realize they just opened but their staff is laughably untrained.  fixable problems but I don't think service and d\u00e9cor are priorities for lola.
3029	1	a	"I can honestly say never been to Louisiana but since the day went too the original Lola  on Charleston. I feel like jumped on plane right on to bourbon street. Just soaking all the finest things the Big Easy has too offer especially the FOOD! Lola she all about keeping too her creole background and sticking with traditional fare but doing it right way from family secrets passed on from one generation to the next. The original location I have been couple times always end up going with one of the Po-Boys. Too DIE for and the most legit ones find in Vegas hands down!! So hearing that they opened second location one much closer on my side of town. Excited! \n\nSecond location sometimes have my doubts. I always think about \""is bigger always better\"". You start to lose focus on the things that made you popular in the first place and consistency of the food more locations add. Lola not only small restaurant but great story (one that featured on triple DDD). I love seeing small business owners successful. Right off the top from the moment walked in the vibe, and everything about the interior design screams at you Big Easy. It has the old school colonial look all around, they have area that assume all clams or oysters on ice shuck fresh too order, the bar area think really nice with the brick back splash look to the many widescreen televisions around it, different chairs around the bar area from bar stools to chairs, piano in the bar area (I went for lunch no one playing but assume they do have live music), and NO doubt part of Lola personal taste not miss. She big Saints fan. Dah! You have big Drew Bree artwork. There this shelf near the bar but it feels more like bookshelf at home. Here you have the little things from the mardi gras masks, beads, jars of candy, and all these little almost personnel items. Just the patio area kind of small but had so much personality. They have big oak barrels around, plants, and not just tables outside in open space. Heck you even looking out through window out on the patio area. Just the theme throughout the restaurant got lot of personality but everything that great about the Big Easy. \n\nThe food was awesome!!!! Like I said had my doubts. The Po-Boy went with the Roast Beef. The last time had the soft shell crab. I wanted to knock another one off the list. The bread with any sandwich make or break point for me. Po-Boy had so many imitations that once have the real thing never take step back. Lola is the only place get my Po-Boy on not place comes remotely close. Not just one thing but the BREAD really stands out for me. She gets it shipped in just for the sandwich. It not only the perfect compliment but could get bread all day long. The Roast Beef talk about lot of food. Messy. But nothing better then having the drippings from the beef, sauce, and some hot sauce icing on the cake. It finger licking good. I started with cup of gumbo. Perfect starter! Loved the fact both restaurant felt like the food was consistent. All the things that loved about the first one still are at the original and now the second location. Lola never meet owner that friendly, upbeat, and this passion for food not only saw on the show but in real life. She just happen be sitting at the bar area when I had lunch. It refreshing see owner go around check up on customers and asked my thoughts on my Po-Boy. No doubt plan on coming back again again.."
3030	1	a	Here's my quick review of Lola's in Summerlin.  Yes, that's right.  Lola's has opened their doors in Summerlin.  If you've been to the location off Charleston near the Smith Center, then you know what to expect here and that's good grubbin' Nawlins' style.  Unlike the original location out here, this one has more space, doesn't seem to be as busy, and is a lot cleaner.  That being said, I'm still a fan of the original.  However, if I have choice, I'd make my way here when I'm craving the authentic stuff from Louisiana.  We dined on a mid-week night and it was far from busy.  Our servers were pretty good too.  But let's discuss what's really important and that's the food.  I got their the crab cake and their Bronzed Shrimp & Grits.  This was my first time trying their crab cake and it's huge, a creamy for a crab cake, and packed with flavorful crab.  As for their, Bronzed Shrimp & Grits, still as good as it get.  You get huge pieces of shrimp on top of their grits, sausage, and mushrooms.  This was seasoned just right and you can't go wrong with this dish.  In fact, this is the only entree that I have ever ordered when I dined at the original location.  I guess I should be try something different like their Po-Boys, the chicken & waffles, their jambalaya, or their oysters the next time I'm in.  But then again, it's too hard for me to pass up their Bronzed Shrimp & Grits.
3031	1	a	Went for the first time for brunch. My husband and I sat outside which was beautiful. We could hear the Saints fans cheering at the bar.\n\nI had a delicious mimosa and shrimp & grits. That dish may be my new favorite thing anywhere! My husband had the jambalaya - also good - but I preferred mine.\n\nThe service was excellent, quite a few people out and about to help and our waitress was terrific.
3032	0	a	Service and food choices in the bar were great.  Last time on the patio the food was not the best.  Service was very slow and server was rude.  If I can't eat at the bar I probably wont eat there again.
3033	0	a	My tastebuds are telling me 2 stars, but it could be a 3.\n\nI went to Lola's for brunch a couple of weeks ago. The decor is... random. It was if I was walking into my great Aunt Sally's house who had inherited chairs and tables from thrift shops, garage sales and family members. Maybe that's the theme they were going for?\n\nI was really underwhelmed by their menu selection, but per the waitresses suggestion, I settled on the catfish and grits. I have never had grits in my life, but cheese and starch didn't sound terrible. The catfish and sausage ragout were amazing. The only thing standing in the way of my appetizing dish were those nasty cheese grits! They tasted like salty baby food, just awful!\n\nService was unmemorable. The portions was pretty small for $16.99, but did I really want more cheese grits? Nope! I hear the bananas foster chicken and waffles is good. I'll try that next time.
3034	1	a	So glad that Lola has opened a second branch in Summerlin.  Bigger space compare to downtown location. Great service.  Great food.   The BBQ shrimp reminds me of my aunts recipe- she lived in Nawlins for years.
3035	1	a	Went there for lunch today for the first time and had the gumbo, while my colleague has the jambalaya.  The food and service were both outstanding, and while we were never rushed, we were in and out in less than an hour.  The atmosphere was comfortable and the prices quite reasonable --very nice for a business lunch.  I'm looking forward to going for dinner.
3036	0	a	"Wow...... and that is NOT in a good way. We attended a birthday dinner for 8 last night. Walked in to pleasant surroundings that are mildly reminiscent of New Orleans. Sadly, that was the last positive thing I have to say about Lola's. The joint was dead at 6:30 which seemed like a big ol' warning sign. But hey...it's almost Christmas so maybe?\n\nService was friendly but amazingly slowwwwww. I ask the server for suggestions on the menu and he did my big no-no....\""EVERYTHING\"" he says.  Come on dude, there are better items that you can suggest instead of letting a new customer throw out a line hoping they are going to find the big one!  I also wonder if they were trying to emulate their idea of the big easy with this \""going in reverse\"" kind of service. If so, it ain't workin'. Odd that you sit around a dead restaurant twiddling your thumbs with absolutely nothing to nibble on. Oh well....maybe the dinner will make up for this. NOT!\n\nDinners arrived with absolutely no mapping by the server so the expediter is wandering around the table asking where each (different) dish went. The funniest part of this was that some of the dishes had the wrong sides so nobody knew what was really their dinner. That is where the entertainment ended. \n\nWe had a very eclectic array of dishes and NOT one of them was up to par so let me point out the worst of the bad. Crab cakes....They looked so promising. They arrived looking like a crab cake should but when I/we took a bite they were absolutely mush.....not cooked through and not warm all the way through. EEW!  I NEVER send food back but this was a food poisoning in the making. Sure enough....the crab pinched at my queasy stomach all night. The other guests said their crab cakes were mushy but they ate them anyway....... out of shear desperation for food I suppose. Wonder how they did last night? The shrimp on my grits was tiny and tough. My hubby's catfish was mush. Looking around the table, not one thing looked good. In fact, no one said a word out of politeness but it was apparent this was a huge disappointment for everyone. Jeez...eight bad dishes. Well...I guess Lola's is consistent and NOT in a good way.\n\nAlmost forgot to mention. We brought a birthday cake and they wanted $1. a slice to cut it. I brought all the equipment, plates etc. so I cut it FOR FREE. God knows a dead restaurant with bad service doesn't want to cut a small cake. To top it off, they served the worst coffee ever. (dessert) I was expecting a lovely blend of chicory and french roast but instead they served a watery substance that they called coffee (thinking swamp water)  in the tiniest cups with no refills. What a joke!!\n\nCommander's Palace....you got nothin' to worry 'bout........and my prediction is Lola's Summerlin will not be around long. My predictions have been spot on so far but I will eat my words if they are a resounding success. BTW... my words are tastier."
3037	1	a	"Can somebody say, \""Coon ass\""? Holy Atchafalaya River Basin! In my travels, I always Google the haunts of Guy Fieri's Triple D, and found the downtown Lola's location. Unfortunately it's Christmas Eve, but some folks hanging out front told us to go to the Summerlin location - and I'm glad they did, because this East Texan who knows Louisiana cooking misses this food. I've been out of my element too long. Char-broiled oysters on the half, low country greens, smokey Gouda grits and an Oyster Po Boy dressed for Fat Tuesday...washed down with a Dixie Blackened Voodoo...can't wait to come again!"
3038	1	a	Wow!  This place is busy!  I went here for dinner with my wife last Saturday around 6pm and the parking lot was packed.\n\nWhen we got there, we were promptly seated in the back of the restaurant and our drink orders were taken.  My wife god a Sweat Tea and I got a water.  My wife is a connoisseur of Sweet Tea and she was extremely happy with the taste.  It was perfect, she didn't have to add any additional sweetener to it.\n\nAs an appetizer, we both got a Bowl of Gumbo and a Crab cake.  Crab cake was good.  I don't really like crab cakes but this one was okay.\n\nThe Gumbo was delicious!  I liked the melody of meats contained therein.  One thing we both noticed that was it very salty.  Almost instantly our heads started to pound, so we both started drinking more to offset the affects of sodium.\n\nI was feeling fine after a few minutes and my wife didn't finish her gumbo.  What did I do?  Yep.  I ate hers too. It was soooo good!  But my head almost instantly started pounding again.  So I finished off my second glass of water.\n\nRefills here were super quick, even though we were seated in the back.  These servers have hawk eyes and it's much appreciated!\n\nFor a main course my wife ordered the Catfish.  I ordered the Salmon Grilled with Fries and the Vegetables.\n\nFood took a little while to get out, but we were busy with our appetizers and the free bread that they brought out.  The bread was nicely toasted and had a nice buttery flavor to it.\n\nWhen our main courses arrived, my wife instantly loved her catfish.  I tried some as well and it was pretty good.  \n\nMy plate was grilled salmon with fries and veggies.  The salmon portion was pretty generous.  It was perfectly grilled. Not too dry.  The fries were OH EM GEE good! I have a secret (not now so) love for potatoes and it did not disappoint.  Nice, hot and crispy with the right amount of seasoning.  I almost felt guilty dipping them in ketchup.   The veggies on my plate were an assortment of onions, peppers and mushrooms in some sort of oil.  It was good. I ate it all it was so good!\n\nWe were stuffed, we couldn't possibly eat anymore.  So what did we do?  We got dessert! :)\n\nMy wife got Bananas Fosters and I got the Chocolate cake with ice cream.  Her Bananas Fosters once again impressed her and I got a bite of it as well.  It was very pleasant and sweet.  My chocolate cake consisted of what seemed really more like a brownie with a scoop of ice cream on top.  I'm not complaining, it was very delicious and definitely hit the spot!\n\nWe paid or check and finally left.  The service was great, the ambiance was awesome.  It felt pretty intimate.  The place was clean and thank goodness there is ample parking on all sides of the building!\n\nWe will definitely start coming here more often now.  Highly recommended to try this place out if you like Southern food!
3039	1	a	Christine did a great job!  I came in for a Brazilian wax and she is quick and very professional and gets every last hair.  Her space is very clean.  I will definitely be back!
3040	1	a	Christine was great. I got a Brazilian, plus both full legs done. She made it as tolerable as was possible. She talked to me throughout the entire process which really helps immensely. I really didn't feel self conscious at all, and right now through November 1st, 2014, all waxing services are half off regular price. I highly recommend her!
3041	1	a	Just happened to notice this place open up literally within walking distance to my house. Decided to check it out and was pleasantly surprised. The staff is super friendly but most importantly is the space. It's light, airy, contemporary and CLEAN, like spotless clean. Definitely will be my new go-to nail place.
3042	1	a	Such a cute place as soon as you enter! Very very clean and they have phenomenal customer service! \n\nFriendly & not the typical nail shop where it's loud and they play weird music or something lol. The chairs are so comfortable and definitely not like the ones I've ever sat in. Heated water basin for your feet plus massage chair!! Honestly, everything looks brand new! \n\n\nOoh another thing I loved was that my phone was dying and they offered to charge my phone with their charger! So sweet!! \n\nDefinitely coming back as a regular!!
3043	1	a	Hands down the best experience I've had getting a gel mani and a pedicure in Vegas!!! The technicians I had were so friendly and accommodating!  They both took their time and ensured I was satisfied with the way my nails looked.  I didn't feel like they were rushing and just going through the motions like I have felt in the past at other nail salons.  The location is easily accessible, VERY clean and welcoming.  The music was upbeat and fun and the massage chairs were to die for!  I will definitely be coming back here and for the deal I got I highly recommend trying this place out!!!
3044	1	a	Not sure why there are no reviews of this place, but this place is awesome.  Super fresh salads.  Everything tastes like it is from farm to plate.  You can customize any of the salads they have.  The chicken is amazing and doesn't taste like that weird processed or pre made chicken breast you get at fast food places.   I've been twice.   The fist time I went I got the Caesar.  The second time I got the Caesar in a wrap and let me tell you that decision was life altering.  The tortilla they used tastes homemade, and they are so soft.  Therefore, if assume the breakfast burritos are killer.  Finally, the real icing on the cake at this place for me is they have Boylans soda on tap here.  I had NO IDEA This existed, but it is a gift from above.  I work from home so having this place decently close to the Seville area is awesome.  It's a little hidden if you're headed north on higley.  You won't see it until you actually turn east on williams field.   Anyway highly recommended.  I do wish they maybe had a meal option that subsidized the cost a little it's about $10 for a drink and salad/wrap.  However, based on quality I don't argue it's a fair price.
3045	0	a	Ordered two medium pizzas for delivery and was told they would be delivered in about an hour. We called after 1 hour and 10 minutes and were told the driver had just left with the order. Called again at around 1 hr and 45 minutes in, after placing the order and were told the driver was 'just pulling in to our apartment building ... Well the driver didn't show up until 2 hours after the order was made. \n\nThe pizzas were pretty gross. The supreme was cold, greasy and soggy. The toppings and the dough fell right off when a piece was picked up, cold grease dripping and had a cold, rock hard crust. Meanwhile the garlic chicken was cold solid throughout. It honestly looked like a pizza that sat on the counter overnight, the cheese was solid and the chicken and veggies tasted very old. \n\nWe called them again and the lady on the phone apologized for the long wait. The order came out to be around $40 bucks for just two medium pizzas. We thought at least a partial refund was in order, but the lady said they wouldn't do that. Instead she said they would only be able to give us a 20% discount on our next order since our information would stay in their delivery system. That was nice of her, and while she very polite, the future discount seems totally useless since we will not be ordering from this place again.
3046	1	a	The real deal New York style..waoooo!  Great pizza and garlic knots.  Though this place is very hidden. But a GEM no less!  You should try it youll be very surprised!
3047	1	a	I ordered off eat 24 about an hour before closing. The delivery guy was 20 minutes early and the was ridiculously hot. Definitely impressed.
3048	1	a	Great pizza! Tasty huge pies! Delivery was quick and the driver was a friendly. White pizza was delicious and the deluxe was amazing. We are lucky to have a good local pizza place in the area. Support it!
3049	0	a	I will start by saying I give the food 4 stars. The issue was with their speed of service. I will cut them some slack since they just opened. but it took more than 40 mins from the time I walked in the door till the time I got my food (a Gyro sandwich). The place was busy, but I hope they work on their process. \n\nIt seemed a bit pricey with $3+ for a small order of fries. A sandwich, fries and a drink cost me $14.05.
3050	0	a	I ordered take out,  5 orders, gave it 15 minutes and went to pick it up. There was one person there, no other to go orders and they had not even started on any of my orders. I really wanted this place to be great because I work down the street and thought I would be coming here a lot. After waiting for over 40 minutes for my food (from order time to the time I left with my food) I'm pretty sure I won't be back.
3051	1	a	OK. Second experience at this restaurant was a 180. Got a salad to go. Took less than 5 mins and the salad was huge and delicious, too.
3052	0	a	"Yulk is what comes to mind first! It rook 3 times to get my order right. I said sauce on side waitress brought it back with extra sauce. The pita is prepared them when you order it is saturated with more grease. Food not hot at all! I got a gryo & requested the tizi on the side.  The waitress didnt know what tizi was. We were checked on by the waitress who was on her cell phone &  eating. Phone to ear trying to see what we needed. Final blow was attemptimg to pay the tab. Their system \""went down & we were asked to wait for the owner to arrive so he could fix the problem. After waiting 10 mins. I got steamed! The cook said owner said five minute. Then the cook suggested we leave our credit card # so they can process it later....Uh NO thanks.\nWill NOT be patronizing this place again! Oh lastly the cook does not specialize in Mediterranean cusine & I jad bubble guts before arriving home. Let's see if they are in business this time next year. One positive note the waitress was a sweet girl."
3053	0	a	Came to Olives for the first time hoping for some good Greek food but much like most of the other Yelp reviewers, was horribly disappointed.  After ordering a falafel with Mediterranean salad (with Italian dressing) as well as a vegetable plate, both orders came to the table wrong even with 3 of the young servers coming to the table.  The bottom line is, the food is just ok but the service, time to receive food, and the attention to food detail leaves something to be desired.
3054	1	a	So we went dining to the newly opened Mediterranean grill place. This place has good service and a typical middle eastern feel to it. One has got to try out the Chicken Shawarma sandwich. The fries served with the sandwich are very crispy. Also you get complementary hummus with the traditional bread while dining. The server is very polite. Cost wise, this is a $$ place. Definitely going to try out their other dishes especially the chicken kabobs from the dinner plate menu.
3055	1	a	The food is delicious, all fresh ingredients.  My husband and I stopped  at Olives for a late lunch on Sunday.  The service was good. Lunch began with complimentary homemade pita and yogurt.  I had the Palmyra Salad with a chicken kabob and a wonderful lentil soup. My husband had the Chicken Shawarma.   The owner was present and stopped by our table to see how we liked the food. The atmosphere is bland, but the outside seating will be very nice when the weather is warm. We will definitely go back.
3056	1	a	The new proprietors of the kitchen have successfully created the best burger that I have ever tasted.  The burgers consist of different hand ground cuts of hormone free, free range beef.  The French fries are double blanched, double fried guaranteeing a crisp, yummy fry.  The onion rings are cut to order, the tempura batter light and the homemade dipping sauce perfect.  Stop in and ask for James, one of the new owners and the chef.
3057	0	a	Attempted to check this place out on a Friday night. The address listed is the same as the Park Place Pub. There was no sign anywhere (that I could see) indicating that this burger joint existed. My hubby and I even ventured into the pub to see if the place was inside, but we quickly left after the smell of stale smoke greeted us.
3058	1	a	Ok,I gave it a 4 stars based on the fact that the signature burger ,The Applewood was very good. The service was great the guys who waited on us were very nice and helpful, they had no problem kind of guiding you through the menu. I kind of wish they had their own restaurant; It is located in the back of Park Place Pub and there is no sign outside that I could see. So they lost one star for that and that alone. That being said ,i understand you have to start some where, so when you get your own place make sure it is well lit, people like to see their food.  I recommend  you try their burgers you won't  be disappointed.
3059	1	a	Solid BBQ especially considering its in an airport. Mac & cheese is very good. Service is fast and friendly. Price is very reasonable. Portions are generous.
3060	0	a	Epic failure! I got in line with one couple in front of me. After watching 3 employees spend almost 15 minutes trying to make a salad and weigh out a pulled pork sandwich like they were selling gold I walked away. It's an airport and people have places to go. \nI called the real Joe's BBQ and was told that they frequently get complaints about this location but sadly it's owned by somebody else.
3061	1	a	Grand Opening today!  I love the Hurricane Colada! This one is a really big location.  It has lots of seating, open on Sunday's, and they take credit cards.  I'm so happy we finally have one here in South Chandler!
3062	0	a	Hopefully it was an anomaly but my shaved ice tasted of freezer burn... I've been to several Bahama Bucks in the past, but never had THAT experience before...
3063	0	a	This is by far the worst experience I have ever had. I've always loved Bahama bucks and never had a problem. But today I ordered ice cream flavored shaved ice and get a cup of ice cream and shaved ice. This is ridiculous...
3064	0	a	Awful. When I came in there was nobody else there (I should have turned around and walked out then) and the workers were just standing around talking. (Which is fine. Is there's nothing else to do.) When I ordered the girl at the registered roller her eyes at me when I changed one of my flavors. Then when I got my sno I noticed it was bad sno. Really chunky and full of ice chunks. There was hardly any flavor and the flavor we did have tasted like colored water. I definitely won't be returning. The cooper and Warner location is MUCH better. I wish I could give 0 stars.
3065	1	a	Ask about their exclusive membership for the VIP room. Way cool!
3066	1	a	Best vape shop I have found in Phoenix GREAT customer service. It will be the only shop I go to from now on. Best wishes on the new store! \nKatie
3067	0	a	"Attended the Sammy Hagar event 10/18/14\n\nONE HOUR BEER LINES!!! Absolutely unacceptable for Vegas standards. It's run by the owner of the \""D\"" so the \""D\"" must stand for dysfunctional. \n It has potential but I have no intentions to ever return. I could have drove home and got a beer out of my fridge before we were served here."
3068	0	a	Without a Doubt. The most unorganized group I've ever had the displeasure of having to deal with.  From the start, trying to make our purchase of tix.  Getting nowhere with employees with questions about upgrading tickets after receiving emails to do so. No one answers the phone, no one returns calls.  Ask employees/security questions. Get a different answer from everyone we talked to.  VIP section a absolute joke.  Rude guard at entrance.  Ran out of lanyards for VIP section so people who paid were not allowed to enter without the lanyard that they couldn't furnish because they ran out of them but they sure kept the money.   Will be spending our cash elsewhere.  There are actually venues that appreciate their customers. This isn't one of them
3069	0	a	"RE: Sammy Hagars Birthday Bash on 10/18/2014\nI thought VIP meant Very Important Persons? We Paid $225 a piece (far in advance) for VIP \""Lounge\"" tickets. Still had to wait forever in GA Line....why? We paid extra for supposedly less headache, right? The website had a bunch of promises that werent entirely true. The promised couches? Yeah there were couches... 4 in all,so of course, they were already taken and pulled up to the balcony railing ( taking up the very limited and miniscule viewing space). What about the\""VIP Cabana\"" area that wasnt listed on the website? Nevermind that was just as crappy as the \""VIP Lounge\"" area (Just Rocko & Moose guarding the velvet rope seperating the areas) Our Private bar was a huge disappoiment.. $30 for two nasty beers (only 2 varieties on tap) served in small plastic cups and a half shot oh and lets not forget about the $5 water.. There were only 2 bartenders who must have been hired from the Home Depot parking lot for the event because they were very slow, inept and unfriendly... We did find out later that we could have spent another $100 for two bracelets that would allow us to drink free for the rest of the night...but why when you cant even get the drink you prefer or see the show? The private bathrooms? Give me a break the bathrooms were just closer to our \""VIP\"" area. We couldn't see Sammy the stage or the wide screens, but we could see the volleyball players very clearly. We had the WORST area possible for all the money we spent. The people who spent $85 got seating and a great view of the stage. I wish we would have gone that route it would have been great. As it was..We left. All my Baby got for his 50th Birthday was two VIP lanyards to prove we were there and the view of the back of some guys head. We are very disgusted by the amount of Greed and Extortion that took place and can only hope that Mr.Hagar was unaware and doesn't condone this behavior."

3071	0	a	"I've been going to shows all over the world since the mid 80's and this venue by far is the worst I've ever been to. \n100% pure cluster f*ck!! \nVIP area was a joke! I feel sorry for the suckers who paid for that. We had a better view from the GA area. The line for drinks was RIDICULOUS!!! We spent a hour in line and were forced to buy two drinks each so we didn't have to come back and wait another hour!! Wtf guys!!?! We saw at least a dozen \""volleyball\"" players( T&A) just standing around. Wtf?!? GO POUR BEER!!!! Who the hell is running this joke of a venue!! It's the guy who owns the \""D\""ump! \nThis guy is shady as hell. He came out looking like a pimped out Ronald McDonald. \nThe suit fit cause this guy is a clown. \nI would never return!! Even if I had comp tickets and open bar I would rather drink warm beer with the bums of Fremont. WOULD NEVER RECOMMEND!!!"
3072	0	a	Never again for this venue if this is how they treat upgraded ticket holders. The line was around the block- no VIP entrance- why pay the money??? Endless meandering through gate after gate after gate with no signage or directions to get to the upgraded areas... Everyone was so angry about the beverage lines too...Ridiculous. Wish we had done all our consuming outside and gone dry at the concert. When I finally got to the front of the line, the beer tap was broken... opted for water only to be gouged by $5 for a small water bottle-this venue is charging $32.00 a gallon for bottled tap water- it says so on the bottle- Modesto Municipal water source. What a rip off. Great music from Sammy though. Will catch him in Cabo, hurricane be damned...not here!!!
3073	0	a	I to went and saw Sammy on 10/18  Like always Sammy rock the house. But the venue was aweful, we upgraded our tickets and paid an extra $100.00 PER TICKET for the vip tickets they were so far from the stage it was ridiculous.   As far as getting drinks what a joke!  Had to stand in line for over 1/2 hour to get a cocktail,  waitress couldn't handle the volume, and they needed alot more bartenders.   Would not recommend this venue at all.  Hope the D hotel didn't treat their guests the same way we were treated at the venue.  Glad I didn't stay at the hotel.  Wish I can get my upgraded money back.
3074	0	a	We went to the Downtown Las Vegas Events Center to see the Sammy Hagar show last month. The venue is in a great spot downtown that allowed for easy access to restaurants and bars which was great. I was a little skeptical about the sound quality and the comfort (crowd) but the place was actually pretty cool with excellent sound quality. There are also a very ample number of restrooms, which is a big problem at a number of other places. Unfortunately, the bad far outweighs the good with regards to the DLVEC.\n\n  We had tickets at will call and once we got to the window it still took about 20 minutes for the staff to find us on their list. I showed them the confirmation email on my phone, but they continued to search their obviously cumbersome and/or antiquated system of finding tickets. I wrote this off as first event bugs that needed to be worked out and we moved on. \n\n  The space is cavernous and while there are no seats in the GA area that's fine by me because who sits down at a good show, right? I will say that I'm glad we didn't pay for VIP seating. Most of the VIP area was significantly further away for the stage than we were in GA. The VIP tickets were about 2  1/2 times what we paid and that is hardly worth it just to have a chair.\n\n  The drink lines were by far the worst I've ever encountered at an event and that includes lines I've been in at NHL and MLB playoff games in packed stadiums. We were in line for over 1 hour and were basically forced to buy multiple drink as opposed to standing in line again. When we reached to front of the line we saw that there was a single bartender and one bar back at each of the two service areas. Given the price of the drinks they could have had 2 or 3 bartenders on each side and still raked in tens of thousands of dollars. I was nearly force to hit the PBR line which was significantly shorter. \n\n  My hope is that the folks that run the Downtown Las Vegas Events Center take a look at some of these reviews and take heed to the advice given. This venue has the potential to be a great place to see a show with a little fine tuning by the management. I'm hoping to be able to do a follow-up in the future that is more positive.
3075	0	a	Recently went to this haunted house and was truly disappointed. We bought our tickets at the door which were $30 each and paid $5 for parking. Once we got past security we went into the tent and saw the line which was 300+ people long. We waited in line for one and a half hours and only saw 3 characters. Once we past the first line we proceeded on to the second line which was to enter into the haunted house . Finally we get to go in (after another 30 min wait) and noticed that everyone was going in single file all together . We walked thru the houses in about 10 min and not once got frightened because everyone was walking in a single line and you knew what was coming next. Very poorly organized and not to mention they didn't have any fans so it was extremely hot. My advice would be to go to another haunted house save your money.A scary movie would be scarier than this haunted house.
3076	0	a	I was very disappointed with this attraction. The amount of people they sent through in groups was way more then they should have sent through. The actors were really not that scary. I paid $53 to be in and once in line it was lie we were all the same. I paid for VIP 2 but felt like general admission. I shouldn't have had to wait as I paid for instant access. I would not recommend this to anyone unless there was a decent Groupon for the tickets. Nice try Rob, maybe next year!!
3077	0	a	This haunted house was cheaply put together and just a knock off of Rob Zombies movies. Sadly there wasn't very much originality and the tickets were overpriced for what it was. It was maybe a step up from a kiddie carnival haunted house at best.  My friends and I were baffled that Rob zombie could put his name on this
3078	0	a	First off I am a big fan of Rob Zombie and his movies but this was very disappointing.  I paid for the VIP tickets online and then found that we still had to pay for parking when we got there.  With the VIP tickets we skipped the initial line which was nice but in the first house (Lords of Salem) it was a long line of people walking through pitch black hallways and there was nobody in there to scare us.  \n\nThe second house was visually much more entertaining but still just a line of people walking through this 3D house and not much to be scared of.  \n\nAgain in the third we literally walked through in a line of people and didn't find much to scare us.  \n\nI expected so much more form an attraction with Rob Zombies name attached to it.  I think they need to take a step back and rethink how they send people through.  For the money I spent it definitely was not worth it.
3079	0	a	Ok so all this hype about this house was given to us in San Diego and me and my wife got all excited when we heard it was in Arizona this year. \n\nSo we bought the VIP 2 to get in and avoid the lines like a normal haunted house does. But all they did was push up in front of the line take our wristbands and send us on our way. \n\nThe first house was a major disappointment I had more fun scaring the teenage kids behind us than walking in the dark. The 2nd house was a visual entertainment but waiting 15 minutes to go into the third house was ridiculous. Why buy the VIP and wait. The third houses scariest part was the midget running through the the crowd screaming and scaring people. The effects were good and the actors did their best, but man the whole overall experience was pathetic. Like others I expected way more from rob zombie. We go to several haunted houses a year and this one was the worst, besides a t shirt but i could've ordered that from Amazon. Plus paying to park cmon advance notice would've been nice. \n\nThe 13th floor and others are way more entertaining, heck even a wimpy church one would e better. My advice don't waste your money.
3080	0	a	If I could give this zero stars I would I was completely disappointed it was not scary way overpriced will never do it again
3081	0	a	Went here tonight... First time in years going to a haunted house that wasn't in an amusement park.  Must say that I get a lot  more scared from the cart riding haunted houses found in amusement parks.\n\nIt just wasn't at all scary. I didn't even find a moment when I was scared or even caught off guard.  . & I did have an open mind and was pretty excited about it.\n\nOnly reason why I'm giving this place 2 stars is because they actually did a great job with their artistry.  It was more of an art/movie scene museum. A place where you can come and get an up close look at movie stages and the magnificent make-up. \n\nSo save your money if you are looking to get scared. Come to this place if you want a look at movie make-up and technology.\n\nOh and make sure you pay the extra 11 or so bucks for VIP 1 over general admission. It's well worth not waiting in an obnoxiously long G.A. line. NO ONE was in VIP 2, that's just a waste of money. I would've been REaLLY upset if I had waited in the G.A. Line only to be so disappointed by the weak haunted house.\n\nBottom line - save ur $$$
3082	0	a	Don't go,  between the cost of the tickets and paying for parking.   It's more like walking through a movie set.   Not scary at all.   Save your money!
3083	0	a	This was the most disappointing haunted house I've ever been to.... The first house you just walk through the dark and was boring walking along feeling the walls to know which way to walk... The second house 3-D was awesome scenes but again no surprise or scare.... The third house had more potential for a scare... It was set up like a typical scare but the actors did not do a lot to scare.... The employees that cut the wrist band for the VIP 1 was rude and over all bossy and another employee that was telling you too get your glasses for the second house was just rude... There was no scare or thrill in the way they acted it just seemed like people on a power trip. I always try new haunted houses and this one was a major disappointment... We went with a group of 10 and at the very beginning they said we would have to spilt up into 2 smaller groups to get the full effect so we did but after the first 2 minutes of the first house we were running into other people so what was the point in splitting us up and messing up our night for nothing... And paying to park was ridiculous especially with no warning from the web site.... I enjoyed the fire hulla hoop show outside more than the whole tour.
3084	0	a	Awful.  Horrible haunted house experience.  Expensive.  The actors didn't even try.  There even was a guy in the middle of the dark tunnel telling you how to get out safely.  There wasn't even the classic scary ending with a guy and a chain saw chasing you.  It was completely underwhelming.
3085	0	a	i love haunted houses, but this was a overall bust.  the lines were outrageous, the scares were minimal.  numerous times i found myself wishing in was over because it was simply boring.\n\ni will not go back
3086	0	a	We had high hopes for this haunted attraction, but found out early on no real screams coming from inside, only a long line with little shock value.\nGreat outdoor entertainment and rest room facilities which was a plus.\nPaying for parking and no real directions where to go once parked are negatives.\nFast pass only good for entry at the start but not once inside you wait like everyone else. First haunted house basically darkness with no real special effects. The 3d clown house was worth it and well done. The shootout part was disappointing. Good last effect with different rooms you are sent into chosen by the ghoul- not everyone goes the same way.\nProbably would rate 4th on our list of haunted attractions this year.
3087	1	a	Haven't been to a haunted house since I was a very young girl and had been too scared to go to one ever since. I gathered the courage and went with my husbands protection. While my eyes were covered with my hands a good portion of the time, from what I did see the actors were very well done in makeup and costumes and so creepy scary. My husband said the props were very cool. I couldn't bear to look at them. Super fun and a good time. Not for the faint of heart.
3088	1	a	Best waffles ever! I love the crunchy bits of caramelized sugar complimented by the soft, warm texture of the waffle itself. And you can make the craziest combination from the plethora of toppings available or keep it as deliciously simple as Nutella, whipped cream, and bananas. \n\nBetween frozen yogurt or waffles or both, everyone is sure to leave stuffed and happy!
3089	1	a	I love to get yogurt after karate. My favorite is salted caramel. I put caramel on it too.
3090	1	a	It wasn't bad.  I prefer my waffles a little lighter and more airy or fluffy or whatever.  I suppose it's that way to absorb the liquid from the frozen yogurt but I chose to go with Nutella and whip cream and strawberries.  The service was awesome.  I'm open to another visit.
3091	1	a	Came here to try it out instead of the waffle food truck.  Waffle was good and they have many frozen yogurt flavors along with the whipped creme, strawberries, nutella and many other toppings.  If you're not in the mood for a waffle you can just get yogurt.  Price is almost half of what the waffle truck costs.  Both are good in their own way.  Recommend you try out Yo Waffle.
3092	1	a	The former Hilton is hands down the best place to watch games, especially on Sundays for Football Central. They have a whole theater showing the games in addition to the sports book, the most reliable spreads for betting, and the cheapest beer (priorities) ;) It's the next best thing to actually being at the game (even better actually cause the beers are cheaper!) Especially when my team wins...Go Panthers ;)
3093	0	a	impossible to convey what an absolute inept operation westgate sportsbook presents. the attitude there is surely impacted by the incredible incompetence of management - minor  problems encountered are dealt with total disdain for the customer, rather than even attempting to accomodate. the trickle down of disrespect for the hand that feeds them is attributable to the manager, who revels on  radio talk shows about how well the book succeeds in beating up the players. it is amazing that someone in that positon could be so arrogant and not be noticed by upper level management as being such a dunce. the days of gambling with dignity and honor are long gone in this den of dubious characters!
3094	1	a	Went to Bonefish first nit they opened and expected a lot if problems with new staff. I was mistaken as food, service and ambiance were all great\nI had shrimp and scallop combo and my wife had steak with crab cakes. Food could have been a little less salty but I gave them a B+ on all levels. Will be going back soon for lunch as that menu was less pricy and sounded great\nOur server was a very nice gal named Mikalaya and we would ask for her again
3095	1	a	Order the bang bang shrimp, cold snap ceviche and clam chowder everything was terrific, service is outstanding, friendly and fast. Will definitely come back ;)
3096	1	a	We dined at Bonefish the first night of their soft opening.  We were greeted by a very nice hostess named Ricci.  Our server named Steve had never waited tables before but did a great job taking care of our wants and needs.  The food was above average.  Served fast and hot.  A server supervisor asked if we wanted Expresso.  Really.  It's Espresso. Someone needs to train the trainer.  Am I axing for too much. Lol
3097	0	a	I have more than excitedly dined at the Bonefish Town Square location at least a half-dozen times in the recent past...with both service and food quality so consistent that I order the same entree each visit - without hesitation.  The Summerlin location, disappointingly falls short.  Two entrees ordered arrived well after 35 minutes of wait (at a non-busy 3pm serving time)...entrees appeared and tasted as if they had been sitting under a heat lamp for at least an hour before service -- reminiscent of pre-made, glazed over desserts that sit in diner display coolers for weeks/months.  Lobster served lukewarm and rice with no flavor and a cool crunch, as well, the cocktail menu seemed to have undergone an unfortunate and muddled revision.  Service was genuine and friendly, no qualms there...though for a $100.00 meal -- absolute stellar food quality is by no means an unreasonable factor to expect/demand. I do remain an overall fan of Bonefish restaurants...though I will allow the Summerlin location a second chance hopefully and once these new growing pains have been resolved.
3098	0	a	Went on a Saturday night and sat at one of the tables in the bar area. It was busy but not packed. Service was very slow. Our waiter said he would fill up our water and we didn't see him for 20 minutes. We then asked two other servers to fill up our water and the second apologized for having to wait. \n\nWe started with the Bang Bang Shrimp which was very good and came out pretty fast. Our meals took forever to come out and once they did, they were lukewarm. We ordered the chicken and an 8 oz filet. \n\nUnfortunately, I don't think we would come back again.
3099	1	a	A few days ago I had a very pleasant introduction to the Bonefish Grill while dining with Diane and friends, beginning with excellent complimentary freshly baked bread and butter, along with zesty Maryland Crab Cakes dipped in Red Remoulade Sauce.  These openers were soon followed by a good cup of Corn Chowder & Lump Crab Soup.\n\nNext up for me was a Bonefish House Salad adorned with Pinenuts and Grape Tomatoes, and covered by a really good Citrus Vinaigrette Dressing.  And, to end on a high note I was presented with a moist and mouth-watering hunk of wood-grilled Chilean Sea Bass bathed in Lemon Butter Sauce and accompanied by really good Au Gratin Potatoes and very good Squash.  I ordered the large portion, which was more filling than it looked, and provided me with complete gustatory satisfaction.\n\nService by Krista H. was fine and responsive.  Diane quickly received requested Lemon Butter Sauce for her Parmesan Trout, and I was delivered more butter for the tasty bread.\n\n4-1/2 stars overall!  I will surely be back!
3100	0	a	There wasn't anything particularly good or bad about our lunch.\nWe had the bang bang shrimp as an appetizer. It was quite tasty.\nLunch for me was the fish tacos... they were okay.... a lot of mango salsa and not a lot of fish. The home made chips served with the tacos were good.\nMy husband had the red snapper from their specials. He said it was okay, not really good, not really bad. \nI wish I had a more exciting review to write, but truthfully as boring as this review is..... that is just how boring our lunch was.
3101	0	a	For my fathers birthday he decided to go to the bonefish grille. We had had high hopes but they were quickly dashed. \n\nWe had a shellfish allergy in our party and after making the server aware we ended up finding a shrimp in our appetizer that somehow mistakingly found its way onto the plate. This potentially life threatening mistake was treated very casually and without any apology. \n\nAfter that the food came and a member of our dining party was handed a hot pad to retrieve her plate as the server handed it to her, a very awkward and unprofessional way to be served your meal. \n\nAll the waiters have iPads which takes away from the whole experience. Instead of being able to casually order no eye contact is made as they are too enthralled in ordering with the electronic device. \n\nAs far as the food is concerned it is less than appetizing to say the least. The sea bass was raw in the inside and the fish tacos were small and thin pieces of fish absolutely buried in an overly sweet mango salsa. Encasing the tacos was a stale tortilla. \nThe whole experience was utterly dismal. \nWe are going to have to redo my fathers birthday somewhere else as this was a severe disappointment or better yet cook at home!
3102	0	a	I have patronized this location twice and both times the food simply did not meet or exceed my expectations.  I am not a fussy diner either.  I have to chalk it up to being a new location.  I will try again in a few months.
3103	0	a	"This place is awful! I would rate it as a seafood \""Denny's\"" The calamari chewy and  greasy. The Bass was undercooked, the spaghetti squash was overcooked and like a heap of mush that was served with the bass. I would not recommend this place. The service was also terrible the servers never have eye contact when they are taking your order too busy putting your order in on a iPad. Hopefully they will get it together. Unfortunately I nor my family will ever return..."
3104	0	a	"ZERO STARS\nI am lost for words. \nBut I thought its my duty to let everyone know and help save time and money and perhaps a life.\nThis was my first time going to this resturant  and it will be the last.\nService was horrible, food is not that far from the service. We had so many ppl coming to our table and going (serving or cleaning plates) that we couldn't tell who was our server. \nFor starter we ordered calamari and took forever to take our order; it must be the i pad (tip- get rid of it, use pen and paper).\nOne of our friends dining with us had shellfish allergy, after making sure our server  keenly aware, we found a few shrimp mixed in with our appetizer. This is bad practice. What began as a casual dinner with friends  quickly became a situaion that could've ended up in the ER. Thank goodnes she noticed, but what if it had been a child, we would all be reading a differnt review...\nWhen we notifed the shrimp in our calamari we made the server aware, she didn't even appologize she just said \""thats how it is!\"". WRONG!!  THAT IS NOT HOW IT IS.\nThe next day i called  to contact the manager, he wasn't available. Instead i was directed to the kitchen manager Mr. Joe. I explained to him what transpired, he offered me a gift card to shut me up; of which i refused. He then assured that they take food allergies very seriously, I was then told it was the responsibilty of the patron to accept the risk of possible contamination at this establishment. I guess it was my fault to eat at  fishbone grill. Lesson learned I will never be dining here again. Mr Joe this review is for you... \nEvery 3 min a food allergy resulting in anaphalactic shock sends someone to the emergency room accross the country. \nI can see why because poeple, like those working in bonefish grill, could careless. Staff needs  to be educated about the serverety of these conditons.\nI hope this review can help someone before they dine at Bonefish grill.\nPlease learn from this and if you have a food allergy all I can say is RUN,"
3105	1	a	This place is great, for a new restaurant. Keep in mind it takes a little while to get things moving smoothly. The Coconut Shrimp was amazing. Great crab cakes. The filet mignon I ordered Oscar style was perfect. My only complaint was the wait time for drinks. Each drink took about 10 minutes to arrive. All in all, a very good experience, and I'll definitely be back.
3106	1	a	"We arrived at the restaurant on Friday after Thanksgiving the restaurant was fairly empty so we got excellent service getting to the table right away and the service was excellent for the whole meal and the food was excellent. I had the Kobe beef hamburger which I rated excellent even it was rather greasy. About an ounce or two of grease dripped out of it. But the burger was very tasty and did not taste greasy. The homemade chips were considered excellent by all. The fish and chips were \""the bomb\"". Note: the chips were not British style, but we're the same homemade style.  The fish tacos were excellent. Our server frequently refreshed our drinks so unobtrusively I didn't notice she had been there many times. All in all we were very pleased with the food and service.  The cost of the meal came out to about $17 per person including tip. No alcoholic drinks were consumed. We would definitely come back."
3107	1	a	Seafood is 5 stars, Services is 5 stars (His name is Ryan). Technology interaction to reduce mistakes of order, +1 star. Bang Bang Shrimp plus Bread with Dip are a great start of evening dinner.  Seasonal Menu is impressive. grill mahi mahi with crab lumps is a must try of the 2014 seasonal menu. this is a great place for FRESH Fish, Shellfish and Seafood restaurant.\n\nHowever, Sprit Drinks can use bit more work (mix with Stronger kick). +1/2 Star, if it will take any more stars rating.
3108	0	a	Our first visit to the Bone Fish Grill and unfortunately we left disappointed. Things started off fine, the restaurant is decorated nicely and the initial service seemed fine. One thing that was annoying right away was the music, it was loud and more of the type of music for a bar or burger place. One of my biggest complaints of restaurants in Las Vegas is how noisy most of then are. Im not sure i liked the paper table cloths either it seemed out of place. We ordered an ahi appetizer and it was good, maybe the best part of the meal. We ordered the prawns and scallops and the rib eye. while both dishes were ok but the presentation of the food on the plate just wasn't right. The seafood was covered in butter and the side of broccoli was to salty to eat. The rib eye was cooked perfectly but i thought the cut was somewhat on the cheaper end of the rib eye spectrum. Both dishes came with a side of spaghetti squash but it was not really cooked right and was not that enjoyable. The potatoes gratin was probably the best side we had. The service seem to fade after we had our dinner on the table, how your water glasses are handled is a good sign of how the management treats its customers, ours were rarely filled.  So we will probably not be back to the Bonefish. I will no doubt choose Flemming's next door, the price is higher but the experience is worth it, after all isn't that one of the reasons we go out to eat?
3109	0	a	The minute we walked into this place at 8pm on a Friday night and it was practically empty, we knew we should've left and gone somewhere else.. but we decided to stick it out. Ordered an appetizer (bang bang shrimp- -only so so) and had brought two bottles of our own. We were immediately told of the $10 cork fee Per Bottle- somewhat ridiculous and tells me they take themselves far more serious than they should. Then the waitress said she still had to card us- bad vibe came from her from the moment we sat down. \nFood was sub par at best. Mahi mahi was decent but nothing to write home about. The crab was Smelly from the moment it got placed on our table. We made it clear that the crab did not taste nor smell well and that we would not be eating it- nothing was done. \nWill not be returning. Wish we would've gone with our instincts and left.
3110	0	a	If I could give less then one star I would:(.    My husband ordered a filet w crab cakes. He received sirloin.. I think if you are not aware of your cuts of beef. You are not getting what you pay for. He ordered mashed potatoes received potatoes oh gratin ..\nour waitress spilt my drink, she replaced it ..But charged us for the replacement and the one she dropped. I ordered shrimp stuffed w crab. They gave me the appetizer version. The manager was at our table 3 different times. our check adjusted twice. All we wanted to do is have a yummy enjoyable stress free dinner, and it was horrible.\nsorry I wasted our hard earned money here.. It's like sizzler meats seafood...
3111	0	a	"Only giving 2 stars because server did a pretty decent job otherwise it would be a 1. We picked up a bottle of wine at the bar while waiting for our table. bartender was a little slow considering how few people were at the bar but no biggie, she was friendly and even offered to take the wine to our table. \nServer quickly greeted us brought us water while we looked over the menu. We settled on 4 items:\nLarge order of ahi tuna\nWagu beef and ginger potstickers \nBang bang shrimp tacos \nBlackened fish tacos\n\nAhi was a little bland\nPotstickers -  first order was cold to the touch second was luke warm\nTacos - they originally brought out 2 orders of the shrimp (kitchen told server they had sent out one of each and someone else must have taken ours). Shrimp was ok, not much \""bang\"" though \nBlackened fish tacos were good. \n\nWould have complained to the manager but he was busy dealing with another complaint from a table near us and we just wanted to get home. \n\nSkip this one!"
3112	1	a	"So we went to bonefish last night with a party of 7, they say us down, on time even though the place was packed. They somehow mad a mistake on how many was in out party, thinking only 2. But they still made it happen on time. We ordered our appetizers and somehow the order appeared within less the 10 minutes, now I'm talking 4 different appetizers. Word from the wise, get the bang bang shrimp. The bomb, if you don't try the bang bang shrimp your missing out. The food was good, I ate a t-bones the night before so it's hard to camp are the two, but I wasn't upset in the least. The service was one of the best I've witnessed, especially with a packed house & the slight mix up in the numbers in out party. \nEric Johnson (manager) came out to greet us and apologize for the mix up, I said to him \""I'm truly impressed with your service. Great place, good food, phenomenal service."
3113	1	a	"I went to Bonefish Grill this past Monday in Vegas.... All I can say is that I'll definitely be back!\n\nI had a taste for seafood so we came here. We got in, and got seated in about 15 minutes.\n\nThe restaurant has a classy vibe to it. Low lighting which was nice for a romantic dinner.\n\nI actually ended up ordering Lily's chicken instead of fish because it sounded sooo good!  (grilled chicken goat cheese, spinach, artichoke hearts, lemon basil sauce, fresh seasonal vegetable) My husband ordered fish and chips. I also ordered a winter cosmopolitan which was sensational along with a Caesar's Salad. My husband ordered Corn chowder with Lump crab. We also got some fresh bread with a pesto olive oil and it was sooooo delicious!!\n\nThe salad that I received was just \""ok\"". I've had better Caesar's salad. The croutons needed some help as they were small, dry and lacked flavor. My husband's observation was that they use the leftover bread for the croutons. It seems like a good assumption. The dressing on the salad was somewhat flavorful, but not enough on the salad.. Also, there wasn't enough parm cheese, but the greens were fresh. My husband enjoyed his soup. Now the main courses were delicious...That chicken was divine...the goat cheese and artichokes made all of the rest of the flavors \""pop\"". I tasted my hubby's fish and it had a nice flavor. You can tell that they used very fresh fish..not frozen.\n\nThe service was a bit slow...but still good. Cinnamon was our waitress and she was cheerful and very accommodating.  She even happily took a photo of my husband and I.\n\nAll and all...Good food and service... I'll let the salad thing pass...The rest of the meal, service and the cosmo made up for it."
3114	1	a	Restaurant was very nice although they play old gangster movies on several tvs throughout which makes it hard to pay full attention to the table... Service was top notch and food was delicious. Had the meatball to start and shared the rigatoni and the chicken parmigiana. The chicken was huge and tender but a bit too much cheese on top. Everything was going great until approx 9:15pm the music went from Sinatra style dinner music to blaring R&B and disco. It was quite strange and took away from the ambiance and the meal. The music was loud and awkward and with poor transitions. Great food and great service - just go before the 9pm discotheque starts!
3115	0	a	I really want to leave negative stars!!  What a TERRIBLE experience.  If you are going to a restaurant so you can have actual conversation with the people you are with, don't go here.  Our friend used a ap on his phone he has and the music was at a 110 decibels.  That is like front row at a rock concert.  When we tried to have polite conversation with the manager, asking if they could turn the music down a little, he was down right RUDE.  Informed us that this was the 'Las Vegas experience'.  Wow, is that customer service! Ha ha!  The waiters even have to yell.  It was sad!  Also there was constant up-selling and you felt like a number not a client.  When spending the amount of money our party of eight did that evening, we at least deserve to be treated with respect.  Paris management, I hope you take time to speak with other patrons as there were several  complaining of the same items we were.  The food was good, but the atmosphere and staff killed it all.  So sad, a group of friends came together from around the country and we couldn't even enjoy ourselves.  Trust me this is NOT the 'Vegas Experience'....going deaf is not what Vegas wants for its patrons!  Martorano's you need new managers also,....so hopefully the owner is reading this too, hopefully you would have been embarrassed by their behavior.
3116	0	a	"This place was a joke!  We should have known the attitude we would get when the menu states \""No substitutions\"", \""Don't break my balls\"".  We went anyway because we were staying at the Paris hotel and needed an early meal before the show.  The atmosphere was very pretentious and awkward.  Almost every server that poured water or wine was a nervous wreck and shook like leaves.  We asked for butter with our bread and they brought one pat on a little dish for 4 people!  The wine was very overpriced ($19 for 4 oz.).  The meal was mediocre, especially for the price.  I'm used to high prices for fine meals, but this one really was a disappointment.  I've been to Italy many times and no place treated us like this one did.  My sister asked for salt when they brought her meal and the waiter insisted that she taste it first and stood there while she did it (she still wanted salt!)!!  They made you feel like they were so superior in their knowledge.  I would never recommend anyone go there!!"
3117	0	a	"STAY AWAY AT ALL COSTS!  This place will not last long.  The servers act like frightened dogs.  The management is argumentative.  Your soda comes in a plastic bottle.  The music is so loud it could make a Slipknot fan complain about auditory pain after dining there.  The server tries to force you to order your entree at the same time as your appetizers and when confronted as to why you need to order our entree right away they smugly answer like mindless buffoons \""Cuz that's the way we do it here\"".  By far the worse dining experience we have ever had in Vegas.  We didn't even get past the drinks before leaving that abortion of a restaurant. If you want a comparable dining experience for a lot less money, then do yourself a favor and go to the Double Down on Paradise and scrape the dried sputum off the floor and put it on a plate.  You won't even be able to tell the difference between that and  Martorano's complimentary bread with ground rat meat they place on the table prior to cattle prodding you into ordering.  I know it's an Italian restaurant so mind my French when I say this place SUCKS!"
3118	0	a	Bottom line don't go !!!  They push the over priced specials.  Will not serve plain old tap water then charge you big time for bottled water.  And the owner says don't break my balls this is the way I cook.  Well first of all your not there cooking.  I'm Italian the food has to much Garlic and to much salt. OVER PRICED OVER PRICED OVER PRICED .  My recommendation go some where else.
3119	0	a	I am in the Paris Hotel every weekend, so I thought I would take family there to try it. \n\nVery underwhelmed and can't really see what the hype is all about. \n\nService slow (Sunday night in December) we ordered the Calamari as an appetizer (which was OK) and literally a minute after another waiter showed up with our Entrees! The look on his face when I asked him to come back later was priceless! \n\nWe both had the Veal as Entrees, when It came back the second time, I was very unimpressed. It was just a piece of Breaded Veal with a thick sauce and sliced Parmesan cheese.  No Veg, no sides, nothing. \n\nThe sauce had huge pieces of a very spicy pepper, I love hot and spicy food, but this didn't go with the dish at all. \n\nIt's an expensive place, my wife works for Caesars ent, so we got a discount. To be honest.... There's far better Italian restaurants in Las Vegas for the same prices.
3120	0	a	If you want to spend $161.00 for food that tastes like Olive Garden then eat here.  Be careful with the waiters daily special. My Chilean Seabass was $62.00, now I think he should of mentioned that when I was looking at ordering the veal for $28.00.  I'm a foodie and I don't mind spending the money on good food but this is nothing special at all.  You pay for the ambience and food presentation.   I learned my lesson - always ask the price of a special.
3121	1	a	Very surprised by the 3 star rating. My wife and I give it 5 stars!   Everything was delicious,  from the meatball salad appetizer  to the chicken parmigiano.  My wife had the special California  sea bass with lump crab. Setting was perfect and service was superb!

3124	0	a	"OK, this place has only been open a week. However, if it wants to be known as a \""steakhouse,\"" it will be competing with Mastro's, Fleming's, Grill 44 and Ruth's Chris among others. Measured alongside these restaurants, Black & Bleu's management has a lot of work to do.\n\nThe menu is a little bit of this and that. It creates the impression that this eatery has an identity crisis. Most steakhouses will bring out a basket of warm bread or rolls. At Black & Bleu, we had to ask for bread THREE times. In the end, we were brought two slices of toasted white sandwich bread more suitable for toast points than anything else -- and with NO butter. All this in a \""steakhouse\"" charging $44 for a 14 oz ribeye and $42 for lamb chops.\n\nThe wine list is relatively small and mediocre, There are a number of cabernets and pinot noirs but only one merlot. On the bright side, the barmaids are easy on the eyes and the broiler station knows their stuff. Our flatiron steak and NY Strip came out exactly as we ordered. That said, the Lobster Bisque was scorched and the grilled asparagus was limp. In the restaurant world, it's inexcusable to serve your patrons burned soup.\n\nService was needlessly slow. The waitstaff does not know the menu. Example: they constantly referred to \""crabcakes\"" when, in fact, the dish was a single crabcake. The entire waitstaff needs to be trained in the basics. Yes, Virginia, diners should be served from the right and plates removed from the left. The waitstaff has yet to master this basic tenet of service. See: www.chefalbrich.com/etiquette/ \n\nIn sum, the menu needs to be rethought and the staff trained in proper service. Until that time, competing as a \""steakhouse\"" in a market that has so many first-class steakhouses will doom Black & Bleu."
3125	0	a	Business dinner was disappointing. Steak was cooked perfect if you like cold steak ........served warm to cold. Flavor was good but was not hot like my favorite steak house serves. Menu is busy, hard to read and they need to focus on what they do well which is undetermined at this point. No fancy bread before, during our meal. Priced high for the product, location and service. Mixologist makes a good and different selection of drinks. I would return for the drinks. Staff needs training how to serve. I had to fight to keep my salad plate as staff kept trying to take it without asking. I would return for the pumpkin desert and cheesecake desert. Maybe they should be a drinks and desert restaurant? Love the other restaurants run by this owner so what happened here?
3126	0	a	"Went here for dinner. totally disappointed. Our poor server was so nervous and had to go find out the answer to any question we asked (how is the fish prepared, what do you have for dessert, do you have any sauce for this, etc.) his answer for how the fish is prepared... \""the chef said they just throw it on the grill with some salt and pepper\"" REALLY! The Cesar salad was drenched in dressing that did not have the bite of cesar dressing...more of a flavorless ranch. My salt and pepper fish was actually good, boring but good after I got a lemon to squeeze on it but the dessert tasted old and very pre made (some peanut butter brownie that had zero peanut butter taste). We overheard another server telling his table that they have had to revise the menu a few times because of all the complaints they got and that is why none of the servers know anything. yikes. On a positive note, the place is gorgeous, fabulous job decorating and creating a cool ambience. Too bad the food didn't match the great d\u00e9cor."
3127	0	a	Well, we live in the area and looking forward to the re-opening of this restaurant after our daughter and son-in-law said it was good but very expensive.\nWent tonight and the food was good - not great happy hour prices. My husband will only drink Beefeater Martinis. The drink was excellent but was $13! Lower shelf gin and straight up with no vermouth is $13. We can get it cheaper at upscale restaurants like the Sanctuary!\nThe service was spotty. We had to engage 2 different bartenders for service. \nThey are portraying themselves as an upscale restaurant yet the surrounding restaurants in same shopping center have much better service.\nWouldn't rush back
3128	0	a	"I really wanted to love this restaurant. A steakhouse in this area is desperately needed. Advertised as a moderately priced upscale steakhouse, this restaurant is instead desperately in need of a concept/identity. We visited this restaurant at 7:45 on Saturday. The restaurant was almost most empty. RED FLAG, especially since the owner's other restaurants in the same plaza (which we love!) were crazy busy. The restaurant decor is gorgeous but it definitely does not have the more intimate, classy \""steakhouse\"" atmosphere we were hoping for/anticipated. Instead, it felt much more like an overly decorated sports bar complete with flat screens, football games and loud music which seemed to echo across the expanse of space. Upon arrival, the hostess tried (unsuccessfully) to seat us at a high top table in the bar. I guess she just assumed we were there just for drinks?? After being seated in the overly large open dining room, I asked to see a specialty drink menu. They don't have one. \""The drink menu is still being worked on\"". Big miss as liquor is where a restaurant makes its profits.Interestingly, there were only a couple people seated at the bar. The menu was also a surprise as it seemed more geared towards appetizers/salads, burgers, and sandwiches than steaks or other grilled dinner entrees. There were a few high priced steaks/grilled meats on the menu but they appeared as an afterthought. Seeing this, we decided that this restaurant was more of a \""bar\"" than a place where we should consider dropping $33 for a filet dinner.So,very disappointed, we opted to go with the steak sandwich which ended up taking very long to come out of the kitchen despite the lack of guests. The sandwich was bland and disappointing. No taste, at all. Where is the seasoning or the \""special sauce\"" to bring attention to your kitchen? I could have (and should have) made this sandwich at home as it was just a thin grilled piece of meat with a slab of cheese melted on it along with the normal LTM combo on an overly large, dry roll. The steak sandwich at Jersey Mike's is far better tasting than this sandwich for less $$. My husband ordered a side of \""corn off the cob\"" and it had a vinegar taste??? As a side note-While waiting for our meal to arrive, another table was seated. While they ordered immediately, they appeared very agitated as they waited approx 45 min for their food to arrive. Our check for two drinks, soup, and two steak sandwiches came in at a hefty $74. So much for \""moderately priced\"". To survive, Black & Blue has a lot of work to do. Most important, they need to decide if they want to be a bar or a steakhouse. Then, they need a better menu and a chef who can cook. I don't see this restaurant lasting long as it is operated today."
3129	0	a	"This restaurant was better then than it is now! During the so called \""rocky opening,\"" someone else referred to, management was on their game and the restaurant seemed very well-put-together, organized, and ready for business! That's most definitely a different story now! I don't know what happened with the management and just staff in general that was there in the beginning but it's all gone way down hill. Just like the other two restaurants in that complex, Stone & Vine, and Salt & Lime I think it's called, service is horrible and staff clearly has no direction from their leaders! Restaurant is in shambles and not to mention the fact that they've changed their menu countless times now - that tells me there's some serious work that needs to be done in back of the house as well! I don't think I'll be going back - already have been there three times now and clearly nothing seems to be getting better. In addition, I find that with management struggling to get this restaurant off the ground, maybe they should work on actually doing that and not standing around socializing and sitting at the bar - yes, management sitting at the bar. Only glim of hope: the 4 of us ate for around $100 and the food was decent. I wish them luck but overall, it generally is not worth the trip and definitely not worth the money!"
3130	0	a	had such high hopes as we really enjoy their surrounding restaurants in the same plaza.  Liked the decor, so we sat down to our booth when the waiting began.  Finally ordered cocktails, we like rocks, there was more ice in the glass than booze and then they were $9.50 each, basically a shots worth.  Ordered the sea bass, must not have been Chilean, paid $26 bucks for over cooked fish and you only get one side included which we ordered the asparagus which was burnt on the grill.  Come on $26 bucks for a palm sized piece of fish???  I wanted to really support this place but we will not be going back.  I'll stick to Stone and Vine.....
3131	1	a	Went there again and this time sat in the bar. Love it! Me and a friend had salads that were excellent. Really good! The service was very friendly and prompt. This place is really on track! I can really recommend them!
3132	1	a	Another great meal and service.  Tried new dishes as I'm usually a creature of habit.  Had the veggie burger. Very good.  Second time this week  i was here. I usually try to get here once a week. Ahi sliders are so good. Nick, who has waited on us before came over to make sure everything was ok, even though we were not his table. A very happy person right now!
3133	0	a	This place is pretty ordinary.  Not great but not bad.  \n\nAs one reviewer noted, the physical structure is really big.  It seems like you are eating in an empty barn - a nicely decorated barn, but still big.\n\nWe sat on the patio this latest time.  Very pleasant, although the music was too loud and blaring.  It was distracting rather than adding to the ambiance.  In addition, you could occasionally get smoke for the cigar bar a few doors down.  Also, there was a whiff either of the sewer or maybe excess propane from the fireplace.\n\nThe food was okay.  We had appetizers.  The server told us the crab cakes were great, very little filler and lots of crab meat.  Nope.  Just the opposite.  It was filler all the way.\n\nThe tuna sliders were excellent, although you have to like ginger and Dijon mustard a lot.  I do, so I thought there were excellent,  But they are heavy on the ginger and Dijon.\n\nWe also had the Brussels sprouts.  Again, the server said they were excellent, saut\u00e9ed with bacon, etc.  Well, there was no bacon in sight, and they could have been cooked a little more and a little more evenly.  \n\nLastly, we had the tenderloin bits.  They were good, but only when you added one or both of the tasty sauces that came with them.  But they were pretty good.\n\nOverall, there does not seem to be anything special about this place.  Just a run of the mill big box steak house.
3134	0	a	We are advocates of Stone and Vine, which we always enjoy, and have also tried Salt and Lime a couple of times and quite like it. Hence is why we thought we would finally give Balck and Bleu a try, even though we had heard nothing good about it to date. We like to give new places the beneifit of the doubt, that they are trying their best to make customers happy and would like for them to return. We started this evening at Stone and Vine to celebrate an early Christmas with friends, then 4 of us thought we would have a nightcap at the fireplace outside at Black and Bleu. We were surprised that a few days before Christmas, this place was empty as the other restaurants in the plaza were jammed. We ordered a lovely bottle of red, and so far so good. The waitress returned to see we needed a second bottle, but they only had one of the wine we were drinking ( she said that they only ever order two of these at a time?!). This is not a biggie, so we selected a different bottle and continued to chat.\nWe were not quite finished, but close, when a gal we had not seen at all during the evening approached our table and VERY rudely said it was time to leave! She didn't even want to give us the time to finish what we had left! We are all very polite people, but were taken aback at her horridly rude and aggressive attitude, which came out of nowhere! We asked for the manager, and lo and behold she was it....really? Anytime we said anything, such as the waitress never mentioned the restaurant was close to closing when we ordered the second bottle, she jumped down our throats that we had no place in complaining and that WE were the ones giving her grief! REALLY!!!? I can't tell you how many people I will tell to not go there, and of course we will never return! Her name is Amy, and personally, I think Amy should not be in any position that deals with the public as her attitude is the rudest I have ever come across, and we are out app. 4 times a week, so that is saying a lot!\nScottsdale has too many wonderful restaurants with wonderful people serving and managing them. Go elsewhere!
3135	1	a	Best breakfast in Tempe by far! Great quality food and friendly service will definitely keep me coming back! This breakfast spot is  family owned and they are amazing people. You'll probably see the owner Craig in there running around with lots of energy. EXTREMELY nice guy. This place is definitely what Tempe needed and I can't wait to make this my weekly spot!
3136	1	a	The only bad thing about one of my favorite restaurants was that it was too far away from me. Tempe is a much better place for this hip breakfast lunch bar. Some of the best breakfast around. The green flannel is phenomenal.
3137	1	a	This was my first experience at Orange Table and I found it delightful. There was plenty of seating for groups of all sizes, $1 coffee and $2 latte specials and it had a business casual atmostphere. I had the hatch omelette. It was delicious and if you like spicy food this is the meal for you. They aren't kidding around with the hatch green chiles. In AZ i.am used to mild green chile so i was a bit taken aback but the chicken and sweet onions counter balanced beautifully. What will.make.me want to come in everyday though, is the bacon!! I ordered a side of bacon and OMG it practically melted in my mouth. It was perfectly cooked and crunchy and felt like a treat. I think I have found my new breakfast-as-lunch spot. There was a diverse breakfast/lunch menu and you could tell they were excited to be near campus because they had created (or renamed) a few menu items to show off their Sun Devil pride. This is a create addition to the Downtown Tempe District and students, staff, families and tourists will all enjoy Orange Table
3138	0	a	"I came to the Orange Table Tempe on a Sunday morning at 11:30am, we were seated quickly and our order was placed promptly. I had high hopes with the great reviews on Yelp.\n\nOur food came after awhile, I got the Green Flannel. I took a bite. It was cold, not even warm, colder than room temperature. Eventually the waitress came back to check on us. I had to send it back to be remade. My friends steak was warm, her eggs were cold. She thought about sending it back too, but said it was okay and didn't. She tried my Green Flannel and agreed that I had to send it back, since it was so cold.\n\nMy second Green Flannel came out, it was mostly jalape\u00f1os and barely any hash. The waitress said my eggs were coming... I would have liked my whole meal at once. And then I had to remind her about my toast. We had to go to the counter to ask for the check, since our waitress seemed to be distracted and not really paying attention. She ran the bill and the took forever to bring it, so we went to the counter again to sign. The staff was playing with the remote and watching football. I have never written a bad review on a restaurant before, this is my first. I eat out frequently around Phoenix. My friends would consider me a foodie. \n\nThe kicker: I ordered coffee at the restaurant, but I did bring in my own coffee in my Sacramento naked lounge to-go glass coffee mug. I accidentally left my unique mug and didn't realize until the afternoon, after they had closed. I called this morning, less than 24 hours later, to see about picking it up today and I was told by the manager (maybe owner) that he threw it away yesterday afternoon. \""You didn't call yesterday, so it went out with the trash. I can't keep everything that people leave.\"" I could see 2 days later throwing it away, but less than 24 hours? And blaming the customer, for not calling by closing at 4pm? Really? Do you throw away people's drivers licenses or credit cards if they don't come back for them before closing? No lost and found for things that your customers accidentally leave behind? No you just thrown it away. Unacceptable. \n\nPlatinum Service: treating others how they want to be treated. Restaurants come and go. There's plenty to choose from in Phoenix. I'd sure be more mindful how you treat your customers, you lost one. And I will not be recommending your establishment."
3139	1	a	This will be an as served review. Just received my giant cup of coffee and it's great. My wife is enjoying a morning mimosa. Very quaint restaurant, really convenient to the Residence Inn and ASU for an early breakfast. Service has been real pleasant. Next....the meal. Ok....did you feel the 20 minute delay? I was enjoying a great breakfast with a surprisingly good tasting Schreiders sausage (I never had these before). Wife is having these 2 huge banana nut pancakes and loving them. This is really good chinch!!! The breakfast potatoes are well worth ordering with breakfast.
3140	1	a	Really liked this place when they were in Scottsdale and we would go in occasionally.  Thought they sold and closed but realized one of the owners reopened in Tempe.  Went in for eggs and bacon and berry waffles.  Also, the mushroom omelet, mimosa, and Americano.  Everything was good.  I think it will get more refined as they work out the kinks.  The staff is great and look forward to going back.
3141	0	a	"Service was slow, food was not well-cooked, and the prices were too high for the food we received and ambiance we experienced. The wait staff was pleasant and the menu was promising, but everything just felt disorganized and not quite put-together. I feel that maybe in a few months they'll have their \""stuff\"" together a little better, but as of today I feel they charged far too much for the experience they were offering."
3142	0	a	We came here on a busy Sunday and grabbed a seat at the bar.  We got our drinks and placed our food order soon after.  After waiting for our food for over an hour and seeing people who had arrived after us get their food, we stopped the bartender to ask about our order.  He acted defensive and said he would check on it.  Turns out the kitchen never got our order.  He didn't offer an apology and seemed to have an ambivalent attitude about the situation.  As a result we decided just to leave.
3143	0	a	I wanted to like this place.  I cruised the menu a few times and was excited to give this place a try. So after being seated we sat unattended for more than 10 minutes. We were looking around trying to make eye contact with the wait staff, nothing. There was no obvious reason for this. There was plenty of wait staff and it wasn't a full house by any measure.  I walked up to a waitress and asked if your table had a waiter.  I few minutes later the same waitress came and took our order with apologies. At this point it's still all good. \n\nI ordered the garlic mushroom omelette and the Mexican mocha latte. The omelette was plated on top of the garlic sauce. As soon as I touched the sauce with my fork I knew by the skin on the surface that the food was cold. The side of potatoes were unimpressive as well - looked liked the portion was scrapped together and included inedible pieces of potatoes and what I think were onions. My friend really liked her sandwich. I was disappointed enough for the both of us.     \n\nSo would I eat here again? The short answer is no thanks. If a friend suggested it and I couldn't talked them out of it I'd give it another try.
3144	1	a	Excellent experience! Very friendly staff, lively atmosphere, amazing food-get the jalepeno pancakes and Mexican Latte; very unique and delicious. For lunch, get one of their chicken salads, but be prepared to take 1/2 back to the office...they are generous portions.  Another time I had their egg white omelet for lunch and it was light and I felt good going back to work. In short, if you are in the ASU/Tempe area, you must check out this place!
3145	0	a	This was my first and last time at Orange Table. I showed up a minute or two after my friends only for the server to pay little to no attention to me, I was never given a menu to look at, never got to order a drink and when I did got the wrong thing, ordered the stake & eggs that should have come with chimichurri as it said on the menu in the name of the dish but got none. The server never asked how I wanted my steak cooked and I was given a raw slab of meat I wouldn't feed my dog. To try and get some attention from my server who spent most of her time in the kitchen I cut my steak in half and left one half on top of the other to show the very uncooked state of my meat, and with no question if we needed anything else or asking how the meal was our checks where on the table and she was gone again. Worst service and kitchen staff of anywhere I have ever been!
3146	0	a	Started with the host, she told us that it will take more than 25 minutes to get a table and she kind off told us to go somewhere else instead of waiting. Well, we decided to give it a try. After along wait we got the table and sat for over 15 minutes till I asked where is my server. I had table next to me they left because they didn't get served. The server have no clue what's on the menu. Food took over 15 minutes and my gf's brunch burger was really good but my omelet which I asked twice no onions and I end up getting extra onions. I will never come back.
3147	1	a	Love this restaurant.  It just relocated to Tempe from Scottsdale.  Really unique food like jalape\u00f1o pancakes.    You have to go try it!
3148	0	a	If you are looking for a classic breakfast that you can get at Ihop this is the place for you. Service was ok, food was ok, and the fresh squeezed juice had huge chunks in it that you could not drink. We are big foodies that love breakfast and were so excited to try a new local spot and were very unimpressed. They still have a lot of kinks to work out. We wish them the best but probably won't be back. Good thing we used a groupon.
3149	1	a	I really enjoyed visiting this place - in fact, I was there twice in the same weekend as it's a great spot for pre-ASU events too!  Great menu, friendly people and a cool  space for breakfast/lunch.  I also like that they support local artists by displaying their art throughout - great vibe! \n\nMy food was fantastic - I had the Chicken Salad Sandwich and really liked the kick they put in it to make it unique.  The service was great as well and I can't wait until they get their patio!
3150	0	a	My boyfriend and I saw there was a Groupon for the restaurant, so we decided to give it a shot. We've been here twice and both times have been unimpressed. The first time we came for lunch. It was around noon and there were only two other couples in the  restaurant. We were seated quickly and water was brought out promptly, but it took an unreasonable amount of time to get our order taken. We sat there trying to make eye contact with the waitress who didn't seem to be interested. Finally, the hostess came and took our order after about 15 minutes. I got a sandwich and my boyfriend got the breakfast burger. The maple mayonnaise was good on the burger, but the rest of the food was just okay. The chicken on my sandwich was overcooked and a bit dry. On our second visit we decided to go for breakfast. It was definitely busier, but we were seated quickly. Our waiter was friendly and took our orders quickly. We ordered chai drinks which were more milk than actual chai. We mentioned it to the waiter who brought out more chai which helped a little. It still tasted more like watered down milk than chai. As for our food, I got the monkey cakes and the boyfriend got the white flannel. The flannel had a big glob of sour cream on top which seemed to have taken over the flannel. He was disappointed that there were so much big strips of onions and minimal amount of actual potatoes and corned beef. On the menu it said that the monkey cakes had bananas, almonds and coconut. When I got my cakes the first cake had bananas and almonds, but the second cake only had walnuts. Not anymore on the menu did it say walnuts. If they ran out, it would be nice to have been told so. What if I didn't like walnuts? Also, the second cake that had the walnuts was placed under the first cake which seemed like they knew they were in the wrong so they were trying to cover it up.\n\nThe service isn't terrible and for the most part the staff is friendly. However, the food didn't seem as good as most of the reviews are raving about. Would we come back? Probably not.
3151	0	a	OMG. Hit the restroom prior to ordering. It smelled so bad from long term lack of cleaning that I was afraid to order food. I mentioned it to my husband, who had  just returned from the men's room. He said the same thing. We left....feared that the kitchen cleanliness was of the same caliber. Come on guys...a little Lysol and elbow grease  goes a long way.
3152	1	a	Us Pittsburgh Elites got it lucky! Three awesome events in less than a month? Score! And once again, the event was great! \n\nI've never heard of Benjamin's before but I would love to come back and try some more of their delicious entrees after getting a taste of what kind of bites their kitchen puts out. I'll start with the grits and shrimp... wow! First of all, it was my first time trying grits so I was even more excited to try it. So good! I kept saying how it almost or reminded me of mac and cheese. The shrimp was wonderful as well. It went together perfectly and had an extra zing of spice that totally won me over. Next on the seafood menu was the crabcake. Delicious! It was done just right and they gave us a generous portion. Now on to the meat (my favorite! Ha!)! The burger was amazing. Whatever sauce that was, can I have it in a jar to go? I love spicy foods and this sauce could probably go with anything. There is no denying that it made the burger. The meat was also cooked right as it melted in your mouth. Lastly, the apple pie ice cream for dessert was to die for. I'm usually a chocolate or peanut butter kind of guy when it comes to ice cream, but this totally makes me want to expand my sweet tooth more! You could taste every flavor individually. It was fabulous! Great addition, Rachel!\n\nThe place itself had a very cool vibe to it. I liked how we were all spaced out and not packed in together in one room. Shout out to Carrie W. for getting the Buccos game on (sad outcome)! :P \n\nMy only suggestion, as others mentioned, would have been to offer the foods buffet style. About eight of us were sitting near the back and by the time the food would come our way, they would run out. I guess people were taking seconds before we got our first. No biggie because we eventually ended up getting to try everything, but a buffet would have given everyone a fair chance of trying what they wanted without the servers (great job, by the way) running around like crazy. \n\nBeer was good! Definitely hoppy as Meghan B. mentioned, but I'll try anything so it was worth the drink coupons! \n\nThanks again, Rachel! You always do a great job! :)
3153	1	a	I had a really good time with a friend at this event. These events work perfectly for me, as I get to try places I haven't been able to stop into yet. I was very happy and appreciative that they offered a vegetarian burger option, as well as a shrimp and grits sans shrimp. We ended up sitting outside on one of the patio tables, which was perfect because the weather was incredible and it was much less crowded than inside. Further, we schmoozed with the chefs to make sure we could get the first samples before they headed inside. I would say that being inside seemed a bit overcrowded, but who can say no to attending such wonderful events? Thanks again to Rachel for another fun event.
3154	1	a	I switched cleaning companies when I moved to Tempe.  Edward offered me a great deal to try out his company since he already serviced my complex.  I am glad I did because LHS has done such a great job.  Very friendly staff and do extra things around my place that I've been charged for with the previous company.  Great vibes!  Great service!  Thanks Edward!
3155	1	a	Like all Cambodians, we are all donut and pastry experts. The dough was definitely done right so the pastries were amazing to say the least. I had their spinach croissant and it was delice-cious ;) Ate it so fast I forgot to instagram the pic #fattieproblems #followforfollow @chhapaya. Also tried their chocolate croissant and it was bomb.com. \n\nNow the downside... Their macaroons weren't my favorite but I haven't had any good macaroons in AZ so I guess it's on par with other bakeries. The black coffee was lackluster. Although better than the coffee we have in our breakroom, I think the extra walk to cartel will be a better idea if you're coffee fanatic like I am. \n\nBe sure to call an ambulance for the ambiance because the decor was killer. It's good to see restaurants take pride in the small details.  Goes to show how much respect they have for the craft.\n\nOverall I give this place 5 stars because I came for the croissants and they delivered on my expectations.  Service was great and the ambiance was a nice bonus. Only take away I have is that with the thousands of Chase employees that are a walking distance away, having a great coffee selection will probably be the most profitable source of revenue if done right.
3156	0	a	I went in with a friend around 10am on a Sunday morning.  To my surprise,  the whole place was empty.  There were three girls stood behind the counter but nobody greeted us. We ordered the lattes and a couple of croissants.  The lattes were bland but the croissants were pretty good.  I wanted to order the fruit tart to take home but they looked soggy. My guess is the tarts are more than a couple of days old. The service was slow and the girls did not smile the whole time.
3157	0	a	Smiles served daily? When I went there, no smiles, servers didn't know what they were doing, orders took a long time. However, they did say they were still working out the links. The croissants tasted fine but the coffee was not good at all. Not impressed.
3158	1	a	The space is clean and bright. They just opened a couple weeks ago so I would expect nothing less. They bake their breads in house so it smells amazing! The first time I went in I had the almond croissant which was flaky and sweet like a croissant should be. I usually get my croissants from Essence bakery on University, but I might start getting them from Delice since I work across the street. Both bakeries have delicious croissants. The second I went in I wanted to get a crepe but was let down because the cashier said it was only for lunch. I wish they would label somewhere on their menu that certain items can only be ordered for breakfast and others only for lunch. Since I couldn't get a crepe, I settled for the Croissant Eggs Benedict. Even though I didn't get what I had originally gone in there for, the Croissant Eggs Benedict was delicious! The service was good and everyone was very friendly. The only downside, I think, is the situation of the counters. There are two registers you could order from but a weird short wall up front. It's all next to the drink station where you pick up your drinks. It can get a little crowded and confusing the way it's set up.
3159	0	a	So today I ordered a Quich\u00e9 for 10 dollars and it was soggy and small. After waiting 20 minutes for them to figure out how to make it, I can say I'm severely disappointed. I work at a large business across the way, and it is so close location wise. Unfortunately, I will be walking farther for my breakfast option from now on
3160	0	a	Exceptionally slow service. This is now the second time that our crepes have taken over 25 mins to get out. The first time we were one of 3 people at the restaurant. This time though, I even saw the crepes being pulled out of a drawer. If you aren't making the crepes fresh, then why does it take so long? Adding chocolate and marshmallows isn't that time consuming.
3161	1	a	So glad to have this new little gem on mill ave. We need more local places like this! \n\nEssence is always my go-to for croissants. But Essence is also closed on Sundays so Delice is a great addition to the area. Chocolate was delicious as was the croissant. Will definitely be going back.
3162	0	a	Uptight! It's clean and tidy but makes you feel suffocated. No one behind the counter knows how to smile and none of them know anything about valuable customer service, their own menu or their computer. The coffee is terrible and the food is bland, tiny and overpriced. If you want a breakfast crepe, they will refuse to make it until 10am (even if the place is dead and its 9:30). Also, the place is so quiet no music at all, but I'm more than sure that any music wouldn't help. Save your hard earned money! This place is so not worth it.
3163	1	a	This place is fantastic!!! I had a really great salad and my friend had an amazing quiche! The customer service was amazing! You have to top off your experience with a macaroon! And don't forget to take a baguette home with you!!! You won't be disappointed!!
3164	0	a	Delice gets two stars, and it has nothing to do with the food or coffee. Both are fantastic. In fact, I LOVE the coffee. \n\nIt's the service that stumps me, and why other reviews about this place and the service good stump me even more. My colleagues and I work spitting distance from Delice and come here pretty often. One thing we all agree on is that the experience with Delice employees is unpleasant. We'd probably frequent this place more if it were not for the negative attitudes of the employees. Yesterday morning was the kicker! When I went up to place my order, the girl at the cashier rolled her eyes when she saw me walking up and actually tried to walk away from me. I gave her this look like, what are you doing??? (but I was also slightly amused)...and she stuck around. Four of us got coffee yesterday, just coffee, and we all walked out remarking on how rude everyone was from the cashiers to the barista.\n\nPoint being:  I want coffee again this morning, but I don't want to deal with constipated college girls to get it, so I'll walk an extra block down to Starbucks.
3165	0	a	We went on day 1 and waited almost 45 minutes,  we chalked it up to 1st day opening.  earlier this week we stopped in only for some chocolate.  We stood there 5 minutes,  rang the bell and watched servers walk around oblivious.  We turned and left with no an acknowledgment...the chocolates LOOK delcious but the service has been atrocious and we wont be going back. Ive heard the same from several coworkers,  though those who had waited it out say the coffee is amazing
3166	0	a	We went to this Bistro based on a recommendation. It wasn't very busy when we first went in & were able to put in an order right away. My friend & I both decided on the Rosemary Chicken Panini. Considering how busy it was (not too busy), it took a pretty long time to get our food.\n\nEach sandwich was served with a small portion of greens topped with their mustard vinaigrette. I don't care much for greens but I'd say that the mustard vinaigrette was the best thing on the plate. I will preface by saying that I had made a substitution to my sandwich (ordered it with pesto instead of sundried tomatoes) but it didn't matter much since it didn't have the taste of pesto anyway. I thought the garlic spread had a really strong flavor and there was way too much cheese. There was also an off taste to the sandwich ... I'm not sure what it was. After only a few bites, I was tired of it.\n\nThe cookies looked so tempting that even though I wasn't too impressed with my meal, I thought I'd give it a chance. Probably should've thought twice because it got busier at the cash register & they switched cashiers to someone who wasn't at all efficient. It wasn't worth the few dollars I paid or the 10 minutes I waited for it. I'm not sure if I'll be back here.
3167	0	a	"What a disappointing experience! We (party of 4) came to Delice because we are always looking for a good place for breakfast/brunch on Mill and thought this place would fit the bill. Here's a rundown:\n\n1. The people working at Delice are not particularly friendly or helpful. They are not familiar with the menu and anytime we asked a question, they had to go ask someone for the answer.\n2. We came in for breakfast but could only get lunch since breakfast isn't served after 11:00. Ok, we'll adjust.\n3. They were out of a few things we asked about on the menu.\n4. The Muesli is served cold and it took forever for them to bring a spoon, in order to actually eat it.\n5. I asked what kind of flavored iced tea they had and she told me they had black or green tea. Right after ordering, I noticed the tea menu that listed 5 or 6 different kinds of tea (some of them flavored) but she didn't offer to change my order.\n6. Two of us ordered the Prime Rib Au Jus under \""Hot Sandwiches\"" and we were specifically told about the delicious Au Jus that came on the side. The sandwiches were served cold and there was Au Jus on only one plate. They did take them back and warm the Prime Rib and toast the baguette. \n7. They brought out hot tea instead of iced tea.\n8.  The place needs some TLC, cleaning and attention to detail. The menu is taped upside down on the window for passers-by to read. The windows, in the restaurant, are filthy. There were only four tables occupied while we were there but many of the other tables were dirty and full of dishes the entire time we were there. Stuff/food all over the floors. Something splattered all over the wall in the bathroom. Stacks of boxes toward the back of the restaurant.\n9. The owners were there during our dining experience and it seems like they have no interest in making sure things are running properly and they certainly have no attention to detail.\n\nOverall, we were very disappointed and are unlikely to return. This place has a lot of potential but if they don't fix things immediately, they will not be open in a year."
3168	0	a	Nothing special. Greasy Greek food just like you'd find at Arahova or Marathon at twice the price. Annoyingly loud music, like they're desperately trying to create an atmosphere from nothing. Not planning to go back there.
3169	1	a	The best environment a tremendous hookah lounge traditional style $12 a hookah open at 3 pm .hookah hits ausome .play pool  for free with hookah..clean and organized.very friendly staff and they are cafe and liquor. Please visit this place .:))))))open every day 3pm until late nite like 3 pm every day. .
3170	0	a	This is the worst pho I've ever eaten. I took takeout but based on what other people have told me, the quality is the same for dine in.\n\nI ordered the pho special or something like that and it came up to 7.90. First off, the cashier gave me the wrong change. I suppose their system doesn't show how much they owe ( she didn't tell me how much change I was getting back and it didn't show up on the cash register balance facing me either) but at least use a calculator....\n\nNow on to the food! The soup had a cinnamon smell to it and just to make sure I asked a friend and she agreed with me. There's was a lack of meat that was supposed to be there ( the tendon), they only added one piece of tripe, half a beef ball and a few small slices of old beef... This has been the most disappointing pho I've ever eaten. It's no wonder it was empty when we walked in.
3171	0	a	Came in wanting to eat pho and it's the furthest thing from it. Very salty as there is a load of msg. Avoid this place it's not worth your money.
3172	0	a	We've gone to this place at least 5 times since they opened and have not eaten there yet.  From the other reviews,I will count us lucky.  Each time we went they did not have the items we tried to order.  They only thing available was the house pho and since I refuse to poison myself with salt, that's not something I want to consume.  Salt, msg and noodles.  Wow - I can buy a packet of noodles and soup base at the supermarket for 39 cents. They should remove the other dishes from the menu since they never have them available.
3173	0	a	I'm not one to go to Chilis for the service, but the service at this hole is absolutely awful. After being told there is a 15-20 minute wait, we stared at an empty four top that needed to be bussed for over 10 minutes. We also watched as another table say and waited for their waiter (no pun intended) for about the same length of time. This sheer disregard for running an efficient establishment in an airport shows that this chilis has very poor management.
3174	1	a	My wife and I each ordered a regular size with an extra dipping sauce. This turned out to be more food then I thought, almost enough for a full meal.\n\nThe fries were seasoned very well with seasoned salt and came out in just a few minutes. Most of the fries were well cooked but there was an undercooked one or two in my cone. I had the mango and the teriyaki sauces. Both of the sauces were thick white sauces. They both tasted good, but they didn't taste like mango or teriyaki. My wife and I couldn't even agree which was which. The sauces were labeled on top and the one label appeared smudged. I'm curious if we possible got one wrong sauce.  The two sauces my wife got were better, but I don't remember what they were.\n\nThe decor was simple, but nice. The tables with the custom holes for your fries are fun and I always enjoy window seating on State, which there is plenty of. \n\nIt's worth the trip and something refreshingly new to town.
3175	1	a	"You say \""fried potatoes\"" and I'm interested! While I've not been to Belgium, I do consider myself pretty knowledgeable when it comes to fries, frites, and chips, and I've got to say these are different from any I've had here in town.\n\nThick-cut, almost meaty, skin on frites tossed in seasoned salt, served hot and fresh. Could it get better? Add some \""game day garlic\"" sauce or malt vinegar, and yes, it can. I loved the garlic sauce-- thick and flavorful. Also tried the beer cheese dip made with PBR, served warm, which was good. You could really taste the beer!\n\nMy friend and I thought picking up an order of frites would be a good side to our lunch, but really they could be a meal in themselves.\n\nThe atmosphere is nice and clean. The tables have holes for you to set your paper frite cone in, which is awesome. And they're working on implementing an automated ordering system which is pretty cool.\n\nWe met the owner (and her mom) and they were both so very nice! I am excited to go back soon!"
3176	1	a	Best fries I've had in a while!! What a wonderful concept. The sauces were flavorful, the fries were big and crunchy on the outside, soft on the inside, and the service was great. I will definitely be back! (Just asking for more open hours!!!)
3177	1	a	Cool concept. The fries and the sauces are delicious--my friends and I got a bunch of different ones... the garlic/rosemary and the madcity sauce were my favs. But be forewarned... this is literally just fries and sauces to dip them in. Nothing fancy.
3178	1	a	Love the location and the hotel. One star taken off because they can kick rocks with their room keys. I have 4 degrees but my boss had to get me in the room 2 times because the damn keys are hard to use.  Get a damn key slot Marriott. #yesimpissedrightnow
3179	1	a	Very nice and courteous staff. Rooms are typical hotel room comfortable beds fridge and microwave in room. Nice bar with good beer and drink selection. Very cool outdoor area check out the pool at night!
3180	1	a	This place just opened up next door to where I live to my husband and I had to visit and give it a go. We sat in the outdoor patio area which was super cozy, intimate and calming. Really cute string lights that hang over you as you enjoy a glass of wine while a great play list of music plays in the background. The food is great, good portions and quality, yummy selections. You cant go wrong. We didn't like one of the beers and the staff was nice enough to let us switch it out for something else. Very friendly, helpful staff. Love this place and we will be sure to return!
3181	1	a	I had the Mediterranean salad and Athena pasta and hubs had the chicken club and green chili cheese dip .... My selections were excellent ... Salad was not over dressed and the half size pasta was huge and I took some home. The chicken club had great flavor only down fall that took them to 4 stars was the chicken was over cooked and dry. Cheese dip was excellent .... Chris (owner) was very friendly and comped our sandwhich which we returned in the form of a tip to our server. These gestures go a long way in our mind and we will return and give the place another chance for sure.
3182	1	a	Perfect Pear just opened its 2nd location right up the street from me. I've gone in a couple times for lunch and enjoyed it every time. They have a good sized menu with something to please anyone! I'm working my way through the grilled cheese section, so good! The soup du jour last time was mushroom brie and was really creamy with a ton of mushrooms! Place is cute and service always pleasant. Hope they can keep expanding!
3183	0	a	$8 for a frozen frappe??  This is one of those times when I knew I made a mistake before I even ordered but foolishly did it anyway.  It was late, starbucks was closed, and I needed a caffeine pick up to keep my night going strong.  First the cashier was not friendly at all and even copped an attitude when I changed my mind about the whipped cream.  Secondly it took forever for them to make my drink.  And lastly it was the worst frappe I have ever had... along with the most expensive.
3184	0	a	Brought back a caramel apple & it was black with mold in the inside. Good thing we cut into it and didn't take a bite out of it!
3185	1	a	Quick, fast and cheap without sacrificing quality. Not many cheap places like this left on the strip. Definitely a good stop if your in the area.  I don't know that I would go out of my way to get there, worth a stop though for more gambling fuel.
3186	1	a	The overall aesthetics of this food hall is pretty welcoming. There is a noodle place, pizza, bar, bakery, and sushi spot located inside. I only visited the noodle section. It was really packed with people. i suppose the cold weather forced people to look for something warm to keep their energy going. The service was a little disappointing because there was not enough servers. Food was good though. My family and i tried the different noodles with rice. As for the other places, they seem appetizing.
3187	0	a	I have been to chipotles all over California (Bay Area and Southern California) and in and around the Las Vegas area and this is the only chipotle that gives you BELOW mediocre service. I have never any issues with chipotle till this one and MAN are these people STINGY as $&@?! When they give out food in anything. I have gone there 3 times at 3 different times of the day (opening, mid day, and lunch), with different people helping me and hoping it would be different. Sad to say it was the same thing. Barely any meat or anything at that in my bowl or burrito. The chipotles at Sarah/S Fort Apachie Rd AND E Haron/S Maryland have far better customer service and are very generous when it comes to putting food in their bowls/burrito. Such sad multiple experiences for a place I used to speak highly of.
3188	1	a	It's about time chipotle arrives at the strip! Awesome service awesome food. Still as good as any regular chipotle. Def get the chips and guac
3189	0	a	Both of us got food poisening at this location. Don't know why people give great ratings for a ton of rice and beans with a couple of cubes of meat.
3190	0	a	We were there. Our favorite bites were the habenero and bacon macaroon, the Thai food, and the delicious Honey Bear's BBQ. But this was a completely unsuccessful event in my opinion.  We visited all the food vendors in less than an hour and could not wait to get out of there.  We might have stayed longer except the music was WAY too loud, there was no place to sit down, the place was hot (and it was a relatively cool, rainy evening) piles of trash and garbage filled the few tables that were available to stand next to, and the drinks were way too skimpy.  I'd have rather had fewer on the drink card but gotten FULL drinks rather than one-finger pours of red wine or two sips of beer.  That was totally ridiculous. The Judges picked  the carnitas from El Palacio as the winner but they must not have eaten the same ones we tried, which were greasy and overly salted.  It was tragically bad and we spit it out.  \n\nThe Venue is a nice looking place, but is it up to fire code? Sure didn't feel like it, especially with one narrow and steep stairway as the only method to get upstairs.  And it cannot be an ADA compliant facility since there was no wheelchair access.\n\nSO, overall, marginal food, terrible drinks, way too loud and too crowded, no place to sit, garbage everywhere... you can do better, Scottsdale.
3191	0	a	"I was concerned as to who selected The Venue, and what City Official inspected it... There was absolutely no handicap access beyond the lobby. Are there not regulations and laws regarding this? No one in the entire Scottsdale Chamber of Commerce nor The City are familiar with ADA (American Disabilities Act)?\n\nAdditionally, if a fire had started with all that food cooking, what a bloody disaster with one staircase and obscure exit signs. Trash from the few available table tops literally piled up a foot, and we saw NO staff assigned to clean up.\n\nAs far as the winners go, the \""Judges\"" must have gone through years of taste-bud corrosion by over-use of garlic, salt, and grease. It's the only explanation for selecting El Palacio. My husband and I much preferred Honey Bear's BBQ.\n\n\""Spice\"" does NOT solely include peppers. There was NO Italian food represented, NO Indian or Middle Eastern selections, and NO Ethiopian/African food... I mean if we're only looking for hot, hotter, and hottest, then Ethiopian is the real ticket. The drink volumes were miserly (including tepid water - with NO ICE). The Venue was hot, muggy, overly crowded, and *ridiculously* LOUD.\n\nALL THIS DURING THE FIRST HOUR. Yeesh!! Needless to say, we left. And yes, we had visited and tasted selections from every food vendor involved in the event **IN AN HOUR**.\n\nThe upside? We found some fabulous restaurants to explore. However, my husband & I have decided not attend this event ever again."
3192	1	a	Had a early dinner with my daughters, and the food and service were perfect for a Mexican restaurant. A great addition to the neighborhood, and should thrive.. Great price point, and very clean dinning area..
3193	0	a	I hate to give a one star review. The servers were very nice; unfortunately they were very inattentive. They got an order wrong and barely checked on us; I was parched all through our Wednesday night dinner. I got the arroz con pollo, and it was more than disappointing. After searching for the chicken and rice in my meal, I was left with an actual half a plate of just onion. I won't be going back.
3194	0	a	We were really excited to try this place ever since we found out it would replace Loco Lime (which by the way was pretty decent). We arrived on Monday night and realized we were the only ones in the restaurant (never a good sign). We were greeted and asked immediately if we wanted drinks, so we ordered a Jalape\u00f1o Margarita and a house margarita, which were on special. We were also given some chips and salsa. Let me break down our experience:\n\nMargaritas: The Jalape\u00f1o did not have much kick to it, but it was drinkable. Unfortunately, as mine (house margarita) was being made I noticed that our waitress and another waitress were sampling different combinations and looked very confused about how to mix the ingredients. Needless to say it tasted like coconut water, so they definitely did not get it right. \n\nFood: Chips were extremely greasy, salsa was sub par. We ordered the cheese dip, which was pretty good but again could not take down anymore of the extremely greased-up chips. We ordered the steak quesadilla and no lie, within 2 minutes we received it from the kitchen. I have to say we make better quesadillas at home. The cheese wasn't even melted inside and it was extremely small (was also not cut).\n\nService- our waitress was really nice, but it was interesting to note that the other waitresses were sitting at the bar, chatting and on their phones. \n\nWe will never be back here. Azteca brings much more to the table and it's worth the drive. I hate to be a pessimist, but I can't imagine this place will stay open very long.
3195	0	a	The smallest lunch chimichanga portion I've ever come across in my life. The price was in-line with other places but the size was ridiculous.  I actually ate more chips at the end just to fill up.\n\nMy chimi was understuffed, came with almost no toppings except the bottom quarter-sized tomato slice that most people throw out, a laughable amount of beans, and some  lettuce shreds on the side that had a distinct chemical-flavor ...maybe cleaning solution from a counter? and no rice. \n\nMy co-workers Lunch-sized Quesadilla did come with rice...and was a normal portion-size. I was just the lucky one who ordered poorly.\n\nService was very quiet. We did receive our meals quickly however there wasn't a whole lot of follow up on how anything was.\n\nI did like the salsa and I thought the place itself seemed clean/comfortable.
3196	0	a	Tried out the new La Unica as a taco tuesday replacement since it is in the former Loco Lime location. Bland, tasteless, is the only way I can describe it. Maybe you can get more from something other than $1 tacos, but it seems a step down from the restaurant it replaces.
3197	1	a	Great new spot on the second floor of the freshly opened College Avenue Commons. Vantage point from the patio offers great views and a modern, classier edge for the sophisticated ASU faculty member or administrative staff. They have happy hour deals including $1 off house wines and $5 beers (think local craft from San Tan). The small menu offers nibbles but this prime location is a great starting point for a Friday Happy Hour. Soon to join the area: Local fave Postino and Snooze. Overall, worth a chance to hob-nob with Dr. Crow and his elite inner circle.
3198	1	a	ASU opened this place up during the fall 2014 semester, and it's a nice place to stop by and relax. I walk past it a couple times a week on the way to and from class; it's an extremely convenient location for students and offers everything you need for a casual lunch experience with friends.\n\nI've stopped by a few times during lunch for the $5 beers and sandwiches. It's actually a really awesome venue with a very modern interior and an expansive balcony. I thought it was poised to be the perfect addition to College Avenue... that was, until Postino opened up right across the street with their happy hour specials. Still, Pitchfork & Corks is a great place to stop by and it seems to be frequently used by ASU faculty and their special guests.
3199	1	a	Mike is AMAZING! I highly recommend him for anyone who needs an iPhone repair! He was able to fix it the same day and he came to my work!!! He is the best.
3200	1	a	Mike was awesome! Called him on an afternoon from my office and he came within the hour. Ten minutes later phone was like new! Amazing prices and great service!!
3201	1	a	Mike was amazing !! Called him and within 30 we met at Starbucks and 10 minutes later my screen was fixed!! Great service great price!!!
3202	1	a	Fast efficient service. Mike is fast and reliable. I have used him for my iPad mini and my iPhone 5 and within an hour of calling I had new working screens
3203	1	a	Not gonna lie I've drove past this place a few times and haven't scene a soul. Said screw it I'm gonna try it and I'm glad there's a taco shop with flavor since the other last taco shops. Filabertos is so bland. And this one has great burritos and tortillas. Breakfast burrito, bean and cheese burrito, carne asada burrito were really good. Staff was very nice and friendly. Will be back again. Hope the word gets out on this place.
3204	1	a	I finally decided to try this place and it was well worth it. I had their super nachos and breakfast burrito. Both were very good!! The food wasn't greasy and their tortillas are the best around-not dry and flaky but moist and tasty!!! Give them a try!!!!
3205	0	a	Was looking forward to having a great Mexican neighborhood restaurant in this location. Extremely disappointed with our huevos rancheros. So so salty couldn't even finish. Beans would be excellent  if salt were reduced. Rice okay but again salted to the max. And my hubby felt the same, and he is one to always reach for the salt shaker.
3206	1	a	OMG we just moved here to Gilbert and we've been looking for a Mexican place for a quick meal ... We found it!  \nI love this place! First time here and we'll definately be back. The beans are awesome
3207	1	a	Very pleasantly surprised! This place is great, with a variety of acai and pitaya bowls to choose from for a healthier healthy snack option vaguely similar to a froyo place. Even the regular-sized bowls are a generous portion and can easily serve as a lunch.\n\nInterior d\u00e9cor is modern rustic, and the employees are genuine and friendly. The bowl-building beauties behind the counter are happy to walk you through the menu or make a suggestion based on what you like. My pick is the original acai bowl, which is topped with bananas, strawberries, and honey. Delicious!\n\nOnly suggestion is to implement a loyalty card deal- pricing is pretty fair for the value, but I can see myself coming back pretty regularly and would love to be able to earn a discount of some sort.\n\nEDIT: They now have a punch card! Five bowls gets you a freebie. Cards are at the register, you have to ask for them to sign. Now if they can just upgrade to the sturdier cardboard containers and clear bubble lids (like at a froyo joint), so that you don't have to cram your fruit toppings to take the order to go!
3208	1	a	Finally an quality acai spot! Just bummed it's not closer to me in mountains edge. I had the Rise and Shine and it was so delicious! My husband had Berry Good and he said it was berry good! There's so much I want to try and I'll be back!
3209	0	a	"At the outset Maison June Rose sounds like a good deal but it quickly falls very, very flat. The advertised all-you-can-eat $20 Chinese-style menu turned out to be a bunch of absolutely TINY appetizer sized portions that are neither tasty nor Chinese. Sure, there's things that sound familiar at a 'Chinese' restaurant - some salt and pepper shrimp, some steamed broccoli - but its evident with the first bite that no effort has gone into creating any discernable flavour. Every dish was so unbelievably salty that I had to ask for 3 refills of water. And that's saying something coming from a guy with an unfazeable stomach.\n\nFurthermore, when my girlfriend and I tried every dish on the buffet menu we figured 'maybe the chefs actually try harder on the off-the-buffet menu.' We were mistaken. Not only did the Duck Rillettes taste like a salt lick, but it wasn't even edible. We kindly asked the waitress to take it away. After asking the owner why the dish we sent back was still on the bill (we sent it back), he vehemently refused to comp the $7 dish and said 'whatever I serve is good and people like it.' We did our best to kindly tell him the duck rillette was inexcusably bad, tasted nothing like food and only a condensed and salted preservative - and that we simply did not wish to pay for it. But the level of pomposity was too high to even have a conversation with the man.\nAnyway, I figured I would end the meal with one of those classic chinese desserts - sesame balls with bean paste (Another off-buffet-menu item, $5). The only way to describe it would be a frozen and microwave-reheated version of an almost un-fuck-up-able food. The preparation was so poor that the sesame ball couldn't support its own weight; in fact I was left asking \""why is it so hard to unstick from my teeth\""\"" and \""what discount frozen section did they buy this from?\""\n\nThe owner SERIOUSLY needs to reconsider the buffet menu. If the buffet menu was a baseball player, it would be batting 0.154 - only the Sauteed Chinese Broccoli and the Braised Eggplant and Pork were good enough to warrant a second order. We didn't want to finish most of the buffet menu items (and we're talking VERY small sized plates). I can't tell you how heinous the duck rillette was; under no circumstances should that item be served to anyone without a severe congestion.\n\nTo be fair, the decoration and ambience is very beautiful at Maison June Rose. It would be a great bar for drinks, if you can stomach $16 cocktails (btw there's nothing special about them, only the price).\n\nIf you've had your tongue cut out recently, I'm sure you'll enjoy your dinner at June Rose!"
3210	0	a	"First of all, I must admit that I'm obviously not their target market. In fact, I'm not sure what their target market is, other than drinkers. The music is loud, supposed to be a party atmosphere, but the music is 80s and 90s. The menu has a nice restrained list of items, though there are a few as an \""upsell\"". If I had to pin the tail on the donkey, this is Chinese tapas. The downside is that they serve too little on a plate. They should be plates for 2, scaled up for 3 or more, but they don't seem to scale them at all, meaning that we had to order two plates at times. The items that stand out on the menu are the barbecue pork and the eggplant. But honestly, nothing special enough to bring me back."
3211	1	a	The cheese burger here is really juicy and tasty! I came Fresh days today and surprisingly found that their burgers are buy one get one free! Awesome! Lol
3212	1	a	Great food! I had the egg, bacon cheese burger. Very tasty. The tomatoes and lettuce were fresh and the burger was delicious. My wife had the Chicago dog and loved it. We split a basket of fries and they were great as well. Think crispy In-N-Out style fresh cut fries.
3213	1	a	I stumbled upon the grand opening.....yay me! Purchase a $4 ticket and you get a beer and a glass (normal prices range from $4 - $6 for a pint or a flight).  They seem to specialize in light colored beers: saison, wit, pale ale. The 8.2% dubbel is the sole dark beer. I sampled the wit and went with the saison, which has nice hints of clove,  banana and hops.  The interior is clever,  brick and navy subway tiles, knotted ropes as ceiling interest, and iron and LED candle chandeliers,  with a nice view of their gorgeous copper and stainless tanks. They have complimentary popcorn and peanuts.
3214	1	a	Went here with a  buddy of mine  (Shane) during Nascar weekend a couple of weeks ago. Place was jumping. Had an outdoor band playing and a fun atmosphere. Love the setup and the open brewery area. Tried the sampler which is a taste of all 4 of their beers. I was not disappointed. They all tasted great. I will definitely be visiting again when I'm in town.
3215	1	a	I'll keep the going trend and give it a fiver.\n\nI thought this place was excellent. I came in from out of town and it's been a thing for me to go to a craft brewery or two when traveling for work and maybe pick up some merch.  This place delivered. Hospitality was great (EP is good at her craft) and the beer was extremely tasty. The handful of options cover a lot of ground and are well executed.\n\nThere is just popcorn to eat now but the future holds a restaurant (fingers crossed). The decor makes me happy and the barstools are quite comfortable. I'm sending everyone I know who travels to Charlotte here.
3216	1	a	It is hard to compare with the new grounds for Old Meck around the corner, but Sugar Creek has definitely done a great job transforming the brewery into their own little slice of heaven. I really enjoy coming here and getting the full effect of atmosphere, interior, and crowd.\n\nTheir beer is pretty damn good to say that least, and I enjoy their more innovative recipes. Their selection seems a bit more limited, but again, their quality makes up for quantity. They hit the major beer styles so you shouldn't be fearful you won't find something that you like.\n\nThe wait staff and service were both great.\n\nMy only complaint would be the parking- limited. Always remember to watch out for the parking lot curb when you pull in/ exit!
3217	1	a	Where do I start...OK, the beer is awesome.  Being unfamiliar with Sugar Creek when I arrived the first time, I got the 'full flight' which is 6 beers.  All are awesome, but my favorite is the dubbel.  I've been back now 3 times to get some more.  \n\nLast time I was there, they'd just opened the kitchen.  I had the opportunity to sample two sandwiches, both of which were fantastic, but the 'Belgian Dip' (kind of like a French Dip) took the cake for me.  All around awesome.\n\nOK, so the food and the beer are great.  What about the atmosphere?  The decor is cool and steam-punkish with a slightly nautical theme and totally comfortable to hang around drinking in.  More than anything what I like is that the amicable crowd.  This place is the opposite end of the spectrum from uppity south-Charlotte bars where nobody talks to one another.  If you hang out at Sugar Creek for a couple of hours, you'll probably have a conversation with several patrons, some of the friendly staff, and probably one of the owners who can regularly be seen working the equipment and testing the final product in the taproom after they're done.  The owners are friendly, they hire friendly people, and this attracts a friendly crowd.\n\nTo top it all off, Sugar Creek is close to my work so I'll be back again and again.  \n\nYou will enjoy yourself, come try it out!
3218	1	a	Let me start by saying Amazing!!   The staff is so helpful and I love the variety on the menu.  I asked if they could accommodate my gluten free intolerance.  Immediately they said yes.  I decided to chose a sandwich with  the gluten free bread to go.  They packaged everything to go in a nice bag and even gave me some samples of their desserts to try.    At first when I opened the contained It looked like just a nice roast beef sandwich.  But let me tell you.  When I bit into it the sandwich was full of true flavors of Pho.   Definitely worth trying.  I can't wait to try more of the food on their menu next time I'm in the neighborhood.
3219	1	a	"I generally like to visit a restaurant at least twice before writing a review, but because Buddha Belly Deli is only in their soft open phase and was so great, I wanted to show them some love.  \n\nFirst off, the place looks new, clean, and welcoming for a strip mall space.  Second, we were warmly greeted as we came in.  Third, Clint was very helpful, explaining the menu as we decided what to order.\n\nA friend and I ordered two sandwiches to share so we could try a couple different items.  We got the Szechuan Shrimp Po-boy and the \""Pho Dip\"", both with the house made chips and house made pickles.  I ordered the Green Tropical Tea to go with my sandwich which was very good.\n\nThe Pho Dip sanwich is really nice thin-sliced rare sirloin, bean sprouts, and jalape\u00f1os on a soft hoagie roll with a side of Pho broth for dipping.  The meat was very tender and the sandwich as a whole was so good, it did not even need to be dipped.  The pickles had a great vinegar taste that made me pucker up.  And the chips were basically perfection- light, crisp, flavorful, and not greasy.\n\nThe shrimp Po-boy was equally good.  The shrimp was breaded and fried and nestled in with some yummy marinated red peppers and jalape\u00f1os in the same soft baguette as the Pho Dip.\n\nOnce we were done, they also brought out complementary pumpkin crunch cake for us to try.  It was sinfully yummy!  Moist cake, crunchy nuts, fresh whipped cream.  Perfect ending to a great experience.\n\nClint advised that they will have full bakery display soon..oy!\n\nIn short, they had very good customer service and great food.  They brought our order to the table, picked up our plates when we were finished, and asked us for honest opinions several times.  We will definitely be back.\n\nOh and make sure to get a punch card, because your 10th entr\u00e9e is free!"
3220	1	a	If there were more stars to give I totally would!! I've heard about BBD from a co-worker like daily and the reviews were raving so I had to see what all this was about! \n\n The staff alone was enough to get a 5-star rating outta me. They were so super friendly and prepared to do anything to make sure a happy customer walked out of their doors. I was immediately greeted when I came in, I believe his name was Don(extremely nice guy), and he told me about which sandwiches had already seemed to be the signature sandwiches. I went with the Pho Dip Sandwich with the House Chips and a Thai Iced Tea. There were also 3 slices of the Kimchee Pickles and let me tell you I could have bought a jar of those to eat alone! There was nothing lacking in the flavor department whatsoever, everything just married so well together there was nothing you couldn't love. I told them I had heard good things abouty BBD and was DEFINITELY going to keep it going! As a thank you they brought me a complimentary green tea iced brownie that was just as yummy as everything else.\n\nI definitely plan to become a regular and utilize my punch card and many others in the future! You would be CRAZY to come here and leave anything on your plate. I don't know about yours but they've got one happy belly here!
3221	1	a	Had the pho dip and it was delicious.  Also tried the flat pork sandwich which had lots of flavors and textures going on.   The chips are the best dam thing ever!
3222	1	a	Delicious!  After seeing Shirley B. check in here 4 times in 3 days I knew I had to check it out.  Went with Hubby after work and first off the whole menu looks amazing.  Makes it hard to decide what to get.  We decided on the Thai Clam Chowder, Pho Dip, Szechuan Shrimp Po-Boy, Smothered Sloppy Joe Fries and Thai Iced Tea.  We originally ordered the Japanese Curry Fries but after we ordered and sat down we were told they were out of the curry and offered Sloppy Joe fries instead.  I didn't really want them so said we would just go with the garlic fries.  I thought he then offered red curry fries, which I got, but turns out the Sloppy Joe Fries have red curry in them.  So I ended up getting the Sloppy Joe Fries after all.  OMG they were so good!  For something I thought I didn't want, they ended up being my favorite part of the meal.  Only thing I would change would be to serve on regular plate, it was in a plastic basket on paper that got soggy and then tore and got in the food when we ate the fries.  Didn't stop us from eating them all though.  Everything we ordered was outstanding.  I could eat a vat of the clam chowder it was that good.  Clam Chowder is my favorite soup and the Thai flavors just send it over the moon.  Both sandwiches were delicious and we loved the homemade chips.  They brought out Green Tea Brownies before we left and they were moist and decadent.  I was impressed.  Sometimes you go to a place and sandwiches are great but the desserts are rubbish.  Not here.  They do everything at a high level.   The service was excellent.  Everyone was so friendly and genuine.  I think at least 4 different people checked on us, introduced themselves. asked how we heard about them, talked to us about the menu and how they worked on it.  What a great group of people.  I can't wait to come back and work my way through the menu.
3223	1	a	Everything is really good. The kimchi fries, Ph\u00f6 dip, & the seaweed seasoned chips are so delicious!
3224	1	a	Seeing the pictures and reviews for Buddha Belly Deli, I admit I was expecting a pretty damn good meal -- and honestly it exceeded my expectations. Holy crap those sandwiches were good. My friend and I decided to go with the Char Siu Pork Roll and the Sloppy Joe, as well as some Dragon Fries.\n\nThe Dragon Fries themselves were really tasty - garlic fries with a little kick cooked just right. But what made it really awesome was I asked for some extra spice and they tossed our Dragon Fries in Ghost Chili sauce! The Burn! ... Actually it wasn't as spicy as I would've thought - but they brought us the bottles of their homemade Ghost Chili sauce as well as their Thai Pepper sauce, which we used generously. So we put more heat on our sandwiches and our fries - but surprisingly the sauces weren't just spicy, they were absolutely delicious too! I used quite a bit of the Thai Pepper sauce which went really well in the sandwiches.\n\nAdmittedly, the Char Siu Pork Roll as better than the Sloppy Joe - The Sloppy Joe just lacked a bit of brightness in the sandwich because the short rib was so heavy. There were pickles and slaw, but it probably needed something other than Red Curry as a sauce - at least for me. However, we gobbled up both sandwiches as they were still very tasty. Oh and they had great buns!...  \n\nThe only thing I could criticize was the chips were a little too oily - it kind of ends up being a lot of oil on the plate with the rich sandwiches and chips.\n\nThe guys running the restaurant were so accommodating and clearly cared about how the food tastes - they're new so it'll be interesting to see how they keep up on that. If I lived closer, I'd probably eat here three or four times a week, but even still I do want to go back soon.
3225	1	a	Yes, I'm jumping on the Buddha Belly Deli train...the folks that thought up this sandwich knew what they were doing.  The sandwich by itself was just a roast beef sandwich, the broth by itself tasted like a pho beef broth with no flavor..but together, magic happens!  Not sure if it was the pickled bean sprouts or the slight saltiness of the rare roast beef or the hint of horseradish and fresh jalapenos..but dipped in the broth, the sandwich was melt in your mouth good.\n\nBUT, that's not even the best thing (in my opinion) on the menu!  The sloppy joe (actually a pulled pork sandwich) on a brioche bun was better tasting than the pho dip!  And their house made furikake chips were so good with their house made hot sauces I ate all my chips AND my boyfriend's!  I mixed all three of their hot sauces together and used the chips to dip it like it was salsa! It was THAT freaking good!\n\nI second another Yelpers comment about their Kitchen Sink Gumbo..it was so good, my BF said it was worth more than the $4 we paid for it.  It had bits of spam, chinese sausage and fried chicken skin (YUM) and more..add a little bit of the ghost chili hot sauce and it was a MUST get again item!\n\nWe will definitely be back again!!
3226	1	a	My wife was in Vegas for a work trip and stopped by BBD on her way to the airport. She had the Thai clam chowder which came with crostini, the pho dip which came with BBD's homemade chips and pickled cucumbers (like oi kimchi), and ice green tea, brewed on site. She said the Thai clam chowder was amazing - rich flavors and creamy from the coconut milk but not heavy like New England clam chowder, and just the right amount of spicey. The crostini was a great compliment to the chowder - crunchy and savory but not overpowering. The pho dip was also delicious - she ate the whole plate even though she was full. The homemade chips were seasoned with furikake and the pickles had some Korean kochukaru (red pepper flakes) on them. Both great touches. \n\nShe even brought back a second pho dip for me to try - the sandwich held up great despite the flight and multiple cab rides, and really only served to make me want to go and have it fresh myself. It is rare to find fusion food so skillfully woven and even more so to have it be so delicious.
3227	1	a	"I came here hungry after riding my bike about 20 miles.  I met fellow Yelper, Chris V.  I had sent him a message to let him know when I'd be there.  \n\nThey were open at 11 when we arrived and we were the early birds in the shop.  I ordered a \""pho dip\"" which the menu describes as \""Chinese Five Spice Rubbed Top Sirloin, Pickled Bean Sprouts, Red Onion, Cilantro, Basil, and Chinese Mustard Served on a Baguette with a Pho Au Jus.\""  I also ordered a Thai iced tea and  5 spice carrot cupcake with with ginger butter cream frosting.\n\nThe iced tea was very good and I was asked about a refill when I was almost finished.  That's never done without an extra charge.\n\nThe sandwich was brought to the table and the gentleman asked if I wanted some of their homemade hot sauces.  I'm always game for that and he brought three of them, Thai chili, green monster, and ghost pepper.  He stated that the Thai was the mildest one followed by the green monster.  He then urged great care with the ghost pepper.  For me, the three were good, but I made my way to the ghost pepper and when it was so good, I just spooned it all over my sandwich.  The pho for dipping became an after sandwich drink for me.\n\nThe carrot cupcake was then brought and it was very, very good. \n\nService was excellent and two of the guys came at different times to the table to check on our progress and to see if we were satisfied.\n\nChris gave me a taste of his Szechuan shrimp po-boy and that will be something to order the next time I go.  I did forget to get a frequent customer card, but that will be next time, too!  I am a fan of this place!"
3228	1	a	I think the Curry flatbread is tastier than the Asian BBQ flatbread. Have not had an item that I did not like. Desserts are nothing to write home about, but great food, good coffee and great service here makes this a solid pick for lunch or dinner. Don't forget you can order online, and don't forget to pick up a punch card!!
3229	1	a	"When I think of anything Buddha, old school Chinese kung fu movies seem to come to mind. For this place, it is all about Asian fusion and for any thing kung fu related would be referring to any of their spicy sauces which gives you quite a kick.\n\nSince noticing plenty of Yelp friends checking in to here, I knew I had to make that trip as well. I have already been here twice since then.\n\nLocated just off the Valle Verde exit from the I-215, these guys are located in the Kohl's shopping complex. They took the place of what used to be East Coast Eats, which was not a bad joint to eat at either.\n\nMy first initial visit I went with the Pork Char Siu Roll($8). It has Marinated Pork Shoulder, Carrot-Daikon-Jalapeno Pickles, Asian Slaw, and Hoisin Barbeque Sauce served on a Sweet Roll.  Comes with House Made Chips (Potato, Taro, and Furikake Seasoning) and slices of sweet tangy pickles. With all those different ingredients put together it all came together nicely flavor wise. \n\nMy second visit, I brought my wife with me so we shared the Pho Dip ($9), 9th Island Potato Salad ($3), Soup of the day which was Thai Clam Chowder ($3.50), and Dragon Breath Fries ($4).\n\nThe Pho Dip has Chinese Five Spice Rubbed Top Sirloin, Pickled Bean Sprouts, Red Onion, Cilantro, Basil, and Chinese Mustard served on a Baguette with Pho Au Jus. Basically, its a Pho Soup in a sandwich minus the noodles and broth but with the Au Jus as your dip. \n\nThe 9th Island Potato Salad has Spam, Roasted Garlic, Potato, and Mayo. It tasted kind of bland. I was expecting just a little bit of saltiness because chopped spam were in there.\n\nThe Thai Clam Chowder was good. Basically it was just clam chowder mixed in with curry and some basil leaves. I liked it for it was definitley a different twist on clam chowder.\n\nThe Dragon Breath Fries are definitely rightfully named. You have french fries coated with some kind of garlic oil and you can dip them in a garlic paste/sauce type of condiment that comes with it. Very strong garlic flavors here so hopefully you are not planning on talking to anybody important up close and personal any time soon after eating this bad boy. The plus is that vampires will stay away from you for sure.\n\nService was awesome. They check up on you from time to time.\n\nSome random info: They have water cups available with a water dispenser that is flavored with cucumbers you can visibly see floating around inside the water cooler. No fountain drinks. You can get bottled water or soda. I was told their hours are everyday from 11 am to 9 pm but some of my Yelp friends say they are closed fridays. My suggestion would be to call first before heading out there especially if you are going across town.\n\nOverall, I am a fan of their products and concept. Eventually I will try everything on their menu. Its just that they are not easily accessible from my hood.\n\nYelp 2014 365 Review Challenge #193 \""You dont have to be a Buddhist to eat here\"""
3230	1	a	Great lunch!  Just opened and the food was excellent.   I had the Thai clam chowder and the pho dip sandwich.  The chips that came with the sandwich are retail worthy!!!  I will definitely be back.
3231	1	a	I loved this meal so much I already want to come back for lunch tomorrow. \n\nI really appreciate the offering gluten free options for those of us with a wheat/gluten allergy. It was hard to decide which items to get, but we settled for Thai Curry Chowder, Chicken Salad Sandwich, Dragon Fries and the Pho Dip, all on gluten free bread. \n\nThe bread was thick and sturdy which held up with the huge portions of beef (Pho Dip) and ginger chicken salad in these sandwiches. The Pho was cooked a perfect medium rare, and we loved the five spice flavors with the pickled veggies. The ginger chicken salad was refreshing, loved the crunch from  the walnut, and the everything tasted fresh. \n\nThe soup was delicious, especially with the hint of coconut. Perfect to eat on a colder night. \n\nThe taro root and potato house made chips were divine. I could eat those chips all day long. We also got an order of Dragon Fries which were great, but watch out! Towards the bottom sits all the chili, but we loved it. \n\nI definitely recommend coming to this deli for lunch, dinner, whenever. Good quality food for a very good price,and a friendly staff to back it all up!
3232	0	a	"Yes I'm giving them a 2 star rating, might even give them a 1 star... gets into my fighting stance ready to protect myself. Joking aside yea my whole experience was completely opposite from everyone else who loved this place. \n\nWalked into a mostly empty Buddha Belly Deli and really didn't get that welcoming feeling I was hoping from a new small business trying to sell their stuff. The guys in the back all seemed busy, probably doing kitchen stuff, they were in the back with their backs to us so I didn't expect them to greet us. There was a girl behind the front counter, got nothing really out of her. A little Hi, how are you, welcome to blah blah we blah blah, please take a seat, is this your first time here, try this try that, the usual chit chat would've been great. Customer service was very minimum. I was pretty much over it before it started and wanted nothing. \n\nFirst up was some dessert, eggnog mochi and pumpkin crunch http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/buddha-belly-deli-henderson?select=sI13tDKvWU7DeO-aDueAtw#sI13tDKvWU7DeO-aDueAtw Didn't care for either of them.  The mochi was different. The pumpkin crunch had too much crunch and very little pumpkin filling. No one wanted to finish them.\n\nNext was some sloppy joe smothered fries www.yelp.com/biz_photos/buddha-belly-deli-henderson?select=NZ_IYzKmyGb7rsagypkkLw#NZ_IYzKmyGb7rsagypkkLw It was fries topped with their \""sloppy joe\"" meat mixture and a fried egg.  Again it was different, not like the sloppy joe we all grew up with. And again no one wanted to finish it.\n\nLast was the char siu pork roll http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/buddha-belly-deli-henderson?select=MuGR7Beh8K5RH9PHXNw-Xg#MuGR7Beh8K5RH9PHXNw-Xg It was marinated pork shoulder, carrot-daikon-jalapeno pickles, asian slaw, and hoisin BBQ sauce served on  a sweet roll. I liked some of char siu pork and slaw mixture but not all of it. Didn't like the soggy bread part or the hard dry bread part but enjoyed the bread parts when they were in between. It came with over seasoned chips and some tasty pickles.\n\nThe prices and interior is decent. It seems like it can fit a nice amount of people.\n\nSure I'll try it again, maybe, but not anytime soon. Nah probably not. I still have leftovers in the fridge.\n\nThe positive is that I think it's next to a tanning shop."
3233	1	a	Sadly I live miles away from this place. If I lived closer I'd be coming here everyday exploring their menu. The service is great along with the food. The food is a clever blend of American and Asian foods (for example: Pho Dip). Sadly we forgot to tip on the way out.\nI have no problem with the food or service at all, but their secret menu leaves off a huge portion on what they sell. They have images of pastries on their tvs that display the menu, but its part of the secret menu. I honestly hate secret menus because most of them barely exist and its usually another word for custom orders.\nI dont exactly remember what I got from there, but Im pretty sure all their food and baked goods are yummy if youre into asian foods and things like dim sum or korean barbecue.\nTheir secret menu is huuuuge and probably larger than their displayed menu. Its a bummer for me since I can only go so often.\nThe only pastry I had was their green tea brownies which was good, but the green tea flavor was masked by chunks of chocolate chip. Which sucks because it just tasted like a brownie with chocolate chips.\n\nPros: great food and service without the premium cost.\n\nCons: secret menu is huge and youll constantly miss the true experience of Buddha Belly Deli.\n\nThis place is worth trying out even with their displayed menu.
3234	1	a	Asian fusion and close to home- Win Win!\n\nIt's very easy to find off of the 215 by Kohls.  I walked in being greeted immediately.  I had a lovely conversation while trying to decide on which delicious option I wanted to try.  They have a great menu with a variety of sandwiches, flatbreads and sides.  Their service was good! All were very friendly and professional.  \n\nI chose the Szechuan Shrimp Po Boy.  The shrimp was full of flavor with the great spicy Szechuan zing! I loved it! It's hard to top the main part of my meal but I ordered a side of the Dragon Breath Fries.  Yum!  A combination of garlic and a spicy pepper sauce earned my definite approval. You really won't want to kiss anyone after eating those and they will keep away vampires.  \n\nI'm excited to come back and try more of their creations.  Give them a try!
3235	1	a	I came here for the first time based on a friend's rec and I couldn't be happier that I tried this restaurant out. First of all the service is awesome with super friendly staff. The menu is interesting and the food is delicious! We got the sloppy joe fries, pork roll and shrimp po-boy. Everything was delish!!!!! Even the home made chips, hot sauces and peach black tea were awesome! Def a to go spot.
3236	1	a	Love This Place Recently tried the Sloppy joe fries with the fried egg on top, AMAZING!! \nThe shrimp po Boy is Awesome as well With the Thai Clam Chowder a lil spicy but shoot is it good.. I totally recommend this place to anyone, don't let the horrible reviews steer you clear of this place, I tend to think they have no palate mature enough for a place like this :)
3237	0	a	I didn't really know what to expect from this place but I gave it a shot because the food seemed to be pretty interesting and we are always up for something new.  \n\nWe had the Shrimp Po' Boy and the Pho dip and gave the Dragon Breath Fries a try.  I will say that maybe I'm not a huge fan of Asian flavors with my sandwich and that could be the reason I wasn't impressed.  The dragon breath fries were interesting but I wouldn't enjoy a whole order of them (after a few I was wishing for plain fries)  Again this may just be my taste preference.  The place was nice, clean and super friendly.  Reminds me of something that would be great in the downtown area. There wasn't many desserts when I went so I didn't get one but from some of the pics make the desserts look great.  This shop def has potential, it's just alright for me as far as my taste goes.
3238	1	a	Love this place!!!\nThe menu is so creative and original. And the staff is amazing. Their must try signature dish is the Pho-dip. They do everything from scratch and fresh that day, including their chips. Definitely go check this place out if you haven't already. You won't be disappointed.
3239	1	a	Interesting menu. Pho dip was delicious,  the Asian bbq flatbread was very rich, and the thai chowder was tasty \nI didn't care for the potato salad: not fresh and dry tasting. \nThe service staff were very friendly and accommodating.
3240	1	a	Great food! Different taste to accommodate anyone of any flavor urges. The special in house made chili is something that is a must try. SLOPPY JOE FRIES! Gotta Have It!
3241	1	a	I heard about this place and looked at a couple yelp reviews so I decided to stop in. My boyfriend got the Pho dip, he thought it had a little too big of a pickle flavor to the bean sprouts but the meat itself was amazing. \nI had the shrimp po boy. I loved everything about the sandwich. It was served on a soft baguette, which I really appreciated because I hate when the bread is to crispy. The battered shrimp went really with the jalape\u00f1os and siracha mayo. \n\nThey even brought us our food and did a table check, which blew my mind cause they aren't a sit down restaurant . Thumbs up! \n\nI'll deffinetly be back!
3242	1	a	This Pan-Asian restaurant provides an innovative menu of delicious dishes in a casual atmosphere that doesn't cut corners on flavor or spiciness. The menu had so many options, it was hard to decide what to order.   I had the pho dip sandwich - I wasn't even that hungry when I ordered it, but ended up inhaling it because it was so freakin' good.  Had a taste of the Chicken Katsu that my brother ordered, which was delicious.  We also ordered the dragon breath fries, which had real Asian heat, not Asian-restaurant-catering-to-white-people heat. YUM.
3243	1	a	"Every time I check my phone, there's always a check-in on Yelp, pictures on Facebook and Instagram from Shirley B at Buddha Belly. I've been here a few times because of that but I still have not tried what I've been meaning to try: Pho Dip!  I also wanted to try the Thai tea cupcakes but they don't have them the times I went.\n\nSloppy Joe:\nSlightly messy but not as messy as your regular Joe. Tender meat with more sophisticated flavors. Delish!  5/5\n\nChicken Katsu Sandwich:\nServed on a Hawaiian sweet bun.  I normally skip the buns but with this sandwich, everything just worked well together. 4.5/5\n\nDragon Breath Fries:\nOMG!!! I love fries. I love how the seasonings are spicy and mildly sweet at the same time.  There's chili and garlic - they were not kidding calling this \""DRAGON BREATH\"" fries. Even my burps after...whooo! Sooooo gooood!!!  5/5\n\nThai Tea:\nMost Asian restaurants serve a very sweet version of this drink so, I tend to water it down. Their version is just right. 5/5\n\nMy boyfriend lost his Asian card many moons ago so, feeding him Asian food is rather difficult. However, he absolutely loved this place that he was fine if we ate here everyday. It's Asian fusion but with a mild twist - they're not trying to reinvent anything which is good.\n\nIf you spot those Thai tea cupcakes, let me know!"
3244	1	a	Came here based on the reviews and everyone was on point. I ordered the po-boy and curry fries. The shrimp had a lot of flavor and the bread was nice and soft. The fries had just enough curry that it didn't make the fries soggy. My cousin had the pho dip which was the bomb and the chowder hit the spot on this cold day.
3245	0	a	"I am not sure if there were extenuating circumstances, but this was a truly disappointing experience. I was looking forward to trying the new Uzbek place in town. But this is what happened:\n\n(1) We came in for dinner at around 6pm. The place was empty but they said they were open until at least 7:30. We ordered a few individual dishes (plov, samsa, and various shashlik) and a bread to share. They did not give us any glasses of water until we asked for it. The water had a smoky smell, but it tasted fine, so I did not think much of it (maybe the glasses are being kept next to the grillI). I was still looking forward to some traditional Uzbek plov, shashlik, and maybe even dessert at the end of the meal (they have medovik, which is usually very tasty).\n\n(2) After a wait of about 20 minutes, we received the two orders of plov and samsa. The waiter said the rest of the food would be coming out in four minutes. Except we did not have utensils. One of my friends had asked the waiter for a refill of water, so the waiter had disappeared to the back with his cup but was not returning for a while (it ultimately turned out he forgot about the water). So we found the utensils ourselves. The plov was okay, but the samsa was extremely salty.\n\n(3) After another at least 20 more minutes, we finally received the shashlik and bread. The bread was not fresh at all but it was warmed up, which was nice. However, the shashlik was universally terrible, and we tried several types: chicken, lamb, beef, and liver. This is usually one of the simpler dishes to make, so we were very unhappy. One positive is the portions were fair-sized for the price, but we all found ourselves having difficulty keeping our appetites (which is pretty unusual for me). Needless to say, we were no longer interested in dessert. By the way, we had no napkins either. We asked for some and he brought us two, except there were three of us at the table. We ended up getting more napkins for ourselves rather than ask again.\n\n(4) We asked for boxes (I think at the time we thought we would maybe give the food another try at home). My two friends both had liver kebab remaining on their plates, so we initially wanted to pack it ourselves to prevent any mix-up, but the waiter said he would pack it up for us, and we obliged, warning him to keep track of which box belongs to which person.\n\n(5) He brought the food to the kitchen and came out with our check. The water turned out to cost money (which he never mentioned when we asked for it), but at this point we were already so dissatisfied that we just wanted to get out of there. He graciously said the $2 for the water covered all our refills...\n\nWe wrote down what each person owed and gave the waiter our cards. At this time, he realized that he forgot to add the tax to our check, so we told him he could add it to our individual amounts. While we were splitting the bill and paying for it, we were hoping our boxed food would come out. The waiter forgot about this as well until we reminded him after we paid. At which point he brought it out and said, \""Oh but we did not track which box goes to which person, so you guys figure it out yourselves.\"" You can imagine our reactions (though we did not say anything, since, again, we just wanted to leave).\n\n(6) After I got home and began writing this review, one of my friends informed me that the waiter had also forgotten to give us back our credit cards (and none of us had realized this because at the restaurant we were upset and trying to figure out what would be a fair tip for the absent service and low quality food).\n\nOverall: The waiter was not unpleasant, but he was extremely and unforgivably forgetful and inattentive, especially considering we were the only diners. The food was unpleasant and unforgettable. (As a result of being so unpleasant.) I find it really hard to believe that shashlik could be cooked so poorly (and take so long to cook it so poorly)."
3246	0	a	"I have never been to a Firehouse Subs. I am from NJ and know my fair share of good quality subs, my hometown aside this review is based on hot subs which is not a \""NJ\"" trade. \n\nThis place just opened up, I heard great things about their meatball sub. We ordered 3 subs including a meatball sub, cheese steak and a hot turkey and ham. Wasn't a fan of the fact that you can not watch your sandwhiches being made like other sub shops. Expected a longer wait since they are brand new, no problem. Came home, set the table and opened our bag. The three different subs were not labeled accordingly just with a #1, 2, or 3. Opened all three and found NO meatball sub. Instead we received another hot deli sub of three different meats. \n\nThe bread is spongey and blah, wasn't toasted just warm. The cheese steak meat was minced, the melted cheese was just baked into the soft bread. The other two had zero flavor besides the overwhelming amount of mayo. Three medium subs, three bags of chips for $24. Seriously could have made a ham, turkey and cheese sub on crappy sub rolls from Frys and just microwaved it. \n\nSo disappointed. Was hoping for at least a decent dining option in Maricopa that was not Mexican. I would rather drive out of town to Jersey Mikes or Jimmy Johns, the sandwhich would probably be just as hot by the time I got home. \n\nPerhaps it would have been better had we received the meatball sub we ordered. I'm not even sure I will go back to try that."
3247	1	a	Heavenly.\nI've only discovered Firehouse Subs this last year. Boy do I wish it had been sooner. They sure do make a tasty sandwich,  and the service was both fast and friendly.\n\nThe atmosphere is unique and fun. The staff greeted each guest that came through the door,  and your orders are delivered by name- not number. \n\nI will certainly eat here again. In fact,  I suspect that I will be quite the regular!
3248	0	a	This was my first experience at a Firehouse Subs and I was less than impressed to say the least. I ordered a medium steak and cheese and my husband ordered a large Italian, it cost over $16! The restaurant was busy, but for at least 5 workers preparing food it should NOT take 27 minutes to prepare subs. At this point I was still hopeful that the food would be good and sadly I was disappointed again. The bread and meat were dry and there was no flavor to the subs. I was excited for a new business to come to Maricopa, but I would not waste my  time or money going to this restaurant. I would recommend Subway over Firehouse any day!
3249	1	a	I consider myself a bit of a wing connoisseur and I found the wings to be top notch.  I ordered the mild wings and they were larger in size than most places, very moist and covered with an excellent sauce.  Cooked to perfection.  If this place can get it's service figured out, I predict a great future.
3250	1	a	This place is very very tasty. The drive thru is still there so you can enjoy that, it was fast and the person who took my order was very peppy and helpful which was awesome!\n\nThe wings were perfectly cooked and very large. The only draw-back is the sides. We got french-fries and potato salad. The fries were great (according to my girlfriend) the potato salad although good the portion was incredibly small. It came in a 2 oz little plastic cup and was definitely not what I expected for $1.89 worth of potato salad which is why only 4 stars.\n\nOther than that this place is a smash hit, avoid the sides get the wings you can mix and match the flavors as well and you won't be disappointed at all.\n\nWatch out other wing places this is a serious contender in my opinion!
3251	1	a	If you have not tried this place yet- YOU ARE MISSING OUT. These wings are rated 10 out of 10 in my book. I recommend the garlic Parmesan. They are very close to the ones I make. You can't beat their prices either. I will definitely frequent this place often!
3252	1	a	We got the Bayou Bites & they were really good.. Definitely impressed by the quality of the chicken!! They don't come tossed yet but we did try their different sauces, The Sweet Heat is a sweet chili perfectly made, The Bomb which is Hot, Mango Habanero, & The Voodoo which has some gentle heat!! All the sauces were good & the ranch was also well made!!! Owner was really cool too!!! Definitely going back!!!
3253	1	a	I'm kind of a wing snob, so I was leary trying some place I'd never heard of, but am I glad I did.  I was disappointed to see that Guthrie's had gone out of business since I think they were much better than Cane's.  This was really just a trial run I was giving Voodoo so I just went basic with 9 mild wings.  They were great. Much better than I had ever expected.  They were very meaty and the sauce was excellent.   I hate all these places that have anorexic looking wings, this place does not have that problem.  I will definitely be back to try some different flavors and sides.  The fact that this place has a drive trough just makes it that much better.  A drive thru wing place ROCKS!  They need a website though.
3254	1	a	Just tried Voodoo Wing Co for the first time and it was pretty darn good. We split a 12 piece combo half lemon pepper and half Voodoo sauce. Both were good but I like some kick so the Voodoo was my choice of the two. I might kick it up a notch tho and try the Mango Habanera next time. So grab a couple friends for lunch or dinner and let's keep this place rocking, I like having a wing spot in the hood and I'll be back for sure...See ya there..!!
3255	0	a	Voodoo round 2.. Ordered 12 wings and two pies.. They forgot half my order and I didn't notice until I got home.. The food is tasty but service needs attention. Step it up or you'll be gone the way of Gutheries.
3256	1	a	"Walking in the place looks pretty sweet! The food is amazing and the employees are friendly. I highly recommend this place to eat! For a person that doesn't really prefer Dr. Pepper this place has amazing Dr. Pepper. I plan on coming back!!! Ohhhh yeah and they have a drive thru for those lazy \""a.f\"" mofos. (^_^)."
3257	0	a	I have been to this place twice and both times my order was incorrect. Nice people though, but I would like my order not to be messed up especially when I have to wait 20 minutes.
3258	0	a	"We were pleased to see a wing joint open up in the near vicinity of our home. This used to be the home of Guthrie's Chicken and although my husband was a fan, I was not sad to see it go. After reading some reviews I decided to give this place a shot. I do like the fact that you can place your order ahead of time through the eat24 website, in addition to having a drive thru if you're feeling extra lazy or are on the go. My complaint about their menu on the eat24 website is that there is no description of the wing sauce flavors. So I can choose the \""voodoo\"" flavor, but what is it? In any case, we opted for six voodoo wings, six hot and sweet, and an order of garlic parmesan bayou bites (boneless). The voodoo is suppose to be a mix of sriracha and soy sauce, but it did not have too much flavor. Hot and sweet was kind of like mango habanero at BWW with much less heat. The bayou bites flavor was good but they were super greasy.\n\nI think the price point is right for the mass produced on the go wings -- it is $4.99 for six wings. The sides they offer are pretty limited and to the point consisting of fries, fried pickles, and cole slaw. I would rate this joint well below Buffalo Wild Wings in flavor and quality, but are a decent option if you are on the go and are craving some wings."
3259	1	a	After passing by this place multiple times my bf & I finally decided to try Voodoo wings. I was extremely hesitant because good wings in vegas are rare and most places don't cook them right I got a 6 piece mild w/ bbq & my bf got a 9 piece lemon pepper hot. I was PLEASANTLY surprised the wings were great !!! Fried perfectly and the sauces were really good too. The only reason why I had to minus one star was for pricing. I thought they were a little on the expensive side compared to other wing places. I will be returning !!
3260	0	a	Who the heck has a wing restaurant in las Vegas that closes at 10pm on a Saturday night? Waste of time!
3261	1	a	This place replaced Guthrie's on Cheyenne and Rainbow and I'm ecstatic. I have only gone through the drive thru, and while it might take a few minutes longer than I'd like, the food isalways worth the wait. The fried pickles are just ridiculously good, so crunchy on the outside. I really like the wings as well and while they may not have as many flavored of wing sauce as other places, the wings are cooked perfectly and the flavors are tasty. Two thumbs up.
3262	1	a	Finally a great new barber shop in oldtown. Great detail and conversation. Will return.
3263	1	a	I walked into this great barbershop yesterday that was recommended to me by some coworkers. It's a great little spot with two chairs and a unique environment. They just opened up a little over a month ago so it's not done, but it has a lot of promise.\n\nErick cut my hair and he did a masterful job. Pretty sure I've never seen anyone more focused on a haircut before, which is very appreciated. Being my first time in, he wanted to know quite a bit about what I usually do with my hair and was genuinely interested in making sure I would leave looking how I wanted. \n\nCouldn't be happier with the service I got and the price was spot on. I'll definitely be back and am looking forward to letting Erick give me one of his award winning shaves.
3264	1	a	I've been going to Erick when he worked at The Art of Shaving. Now with his own shop in old town Scottsdale which is surrounded with local shops and bars. Ideal for those that want to look fresh before hitting the scenes.  \nErick is very humble and very friendly. He makes every experience as though you have been friends for years. Always interacting with you while concentrating with your cut. Even beard trims are welcomed with a straight razor to define your line and neck cleanups. \nAlso carries hair pomades and beard oil to keep up with the fresh look!
3265	1	a	Excellent Service and quality work! Probably the best haircut I've ever had. Edgar was awesome! I'll definitely be coming back.
3266	1	a	I have been going to Rita for a long, long time now and I am so happy to be one her many happy clients at Scottsdale She is the most professional, courteous and talented stylist I have ever been to and I have been to many top salons all over Manhattan. Once you find someone as great as Rita who does everything brilliantly, you will never go to anyone else. She is charming and easy going and there isn't anything she can't do. She has an amazing rapport with her clients because she gives them lots of attention. Her cuts and color are cutting edge and very distinctive.
3267	1	a	Really great cut!  Time was taken to do it right; to clean up the shape of my hair and beard.  Finished cut was awesome and better than I anticipated.  Edgar was my barber and my best advice is just let him do what he wants--he has great skill and vision.  I would come back again in a heartbeat!
3268	1	a	I went in for a fade and hard part; outstanding work! Great service and attention to detail. In addition, was very happy to find they were military friendly and offered a discount. I certainly recommend.
3269	1	a	Have to applaud the service and camaraderie at this awesome place! \nThe band we got to hear, Black Bottom Lighters, were not only great musically, they were really nice guys.\nThe manager, Jackie, is one of the most accommodating ppl I've met and extremely professional.\nThe bartender, Jaramie, is as cool as her name.\nAnyone who is smart enough to come here will be glad they did!
3270	0	a	Last weekend I purchased a costume for Halloween - two weeks before the holiday. Around 8 pm the store was not crowded. As I checked out the cashier was busy on her cellphone, but stopped to ring me up. When I got home I was disappointed to find the costume didn't fit. No problem, I will go back and trade it for something else. The next day I went to another location closer to my house. When I asked to return it the cashier said there are no returns. He said that should have been explained when I purchased the costume. It was not as the busy cellphone cashier didn't even talk other than to tell me the total price. However, he said they could exchange it if I found something in the story. I looked, but nothing really interested me. I asked if I could still exchange it later and perhaps my step-kids could use the credit to buy costumes for them. He said no problem, but did point out it would have to be at least equal value because they would not give any money back. \n\nYesterday I attempted to complete the exchange. There was a costume my step-daughter wanted, but they did not have all of it. We were told we needed to get it all there because the exchange had to be more than the original sale - so basically spend more money. Since they didn't have all of it we went to another location to exchange.  They did have all of the pieces but when it came time to exchange they said they could not. The costume originally purchased could only be exchanged for the same costume in a different size. Since the costume didn't fit in the first place a different size of the same one would do absolutely nothing. So basically I am out the $60. Thanks for nothing, Spirit. Maybe work on training your employees to provide adequate and consistent messages since the return policy seems to change at each location. \n\nOne thing is certain, even though I have purchased on previous occasions, I will not purchase anything from Spirit ever again.
3271	0	a	Horrible costumer service. Shop at FUN SERVICES instead.
3272	0	a	I Showed up just before 10am. Left at 1015am because no one had showen up even called and left a voicemail no reply at all.  Door states it opens at 10. My friend and I took two cars left one there to go get food.Came back around 230 decided to go ahead with getting pedicures. One express one spa, with the stuff she put on first with the dry towel which I believe was callous remover not sure what ever it was, but was on the back of my leg and burned like hell. With paying 45$plus extra for gel polish I received no massage. Which is the best of a pedicure. The express one was 25$ and didnt receive a massage either. I went outside and looked at my leg didn't look right. It looked like a chemical burn and  is raised with red bumps. It still stings went back in to ask if it was normal they said it was a scab. Which I knew it was not because it was not there when I arrived and scabs dont peel of so easily when I had tried to figure out what happened. Cute place with alot of potential but was the worst pedicure my friend and I have ever had. I will not be returning sadley.
3273	1	a	Great value lunch special. $6.99 complete lunch include soup, egg roll, and 16oz soda. Place looks clean although the interior is a bit outdated.
3274	0	a	Stopped in to order a lunch to go. The service for take out was fine.\nThe decor is the same as it was with Chengs.\nThe soup was egg drop it was very pale and had no taste.\nThe pepper steak was ok, not much on flavor..\nThe egg roll was inedible. It was so oil soaked. \nI do not think I will return.
3275	0	a	Called ahead to order my food to go. They said they understood what I wanted and it would be 30 minutes. When I went to pick up my order was wrong so they remade the order. Not telling me that I also was supposed to get a drink with my order too. I was over charged and got home only to find out my order was AGAIN wrong!!! I called and they said there was no manager available and wouldn't be able to refund my money and they had no idea when one would be available. Ridiculous.
3276	0	a	The worst chicken ever! They partially fry it and then keep it under a heat lamp until ordered. The result is grease soaked , soggy unedible garbage. The cooks/ servers also do not use gloves or hairnets. They just opened and have a D health inspection. \nThey should have had an F because they are terrible. They do not season anything. Horrible.
3277	0	a	$25 worth of trash. Look at the picture. We waited in line for 30 minutes to get nasty hamburgers some lame chicken french fries that were soggy all in the container here's the real show
3278	0	a	I haven't even gotten my food yet, but I wish I had read the reviews before getting in the drive thru.  5 minutes at the menu board before they acknowledged me, another 5 before anyone came to the drive thru window to take my money, then after I paid she tells me it'll be another 10 minutes.  \nBy the way- don't ask for onion rings in your combo instead of fries, you'll be rudely told there are no substitutions.   \nIf the food is better than the other reviews mentioned, I'll amend my review, but for now I sincerely regret this decision.
3279	0	a	After waiting in a drive thru line for 20 minutes for our food we get home (3 minute's away) to soggy over cooked chicken. \n\nThe workers didn't know a whole lot of anything except how to charge my credit card. \n\nHorrible food don't waste your time or money.
3280	0	a	"I e-mailed and received no response.  I called and got a confused young woman who could not tell me what would be served if I arrived at the \""24/7\"" spot at 7am.  I stopped by at 2pm on a Saturday and found a truncated lunch menu, entirely indifferent service, and a space where only two other individuals sat.  I left.  \n\nWhat's the over/under on this place?  I say 6 months, and I'll take the under unless the PR folks can hand feed some positive press."
3281	1	a	"Lovely! \n\nWhile the layout is similar to Kennedy's and Presidio, the ambiance is different now.  Love the d\u00e9cor and the lighting and the glassware!  The chandeliers and table \""Tiffany\"" lights are great.  Really creates a \""mood\"".  Note... the mood is also dependent on the crowd.  If you happen to be there while Football is going on... there are still large TVs over the bar so \""sports patrons\"" (like myself) can still get their \""game\"" on while enjoying a whole new bar menu and regular dinner menu.\n\nThe Drinks... \nOh... the drinks!  Both of the ones we tried were spectacular.  I can't wait to go back and try the others. They are different and adventurous.  Not your typical Margarita, Daquiri, Cosmo type of list... the names are unique and the ingredients are artisan and not 'run of the mill' liquors or liqueurs  or mixes... sure you might find them at Total Wine but would you have the slightest idea how to mix and match them??  WSS has figured it out... and they make for some tasty libations.\n\nThe Food...\nWe started off with the Bruschetta which came as a 3 serving (pieces).  It was an appetizer... not meal size or anything huge.  A good starter that was presented on a wooden board.  The grilled bread is what hooked me as well as the fresh, sweet tomatoes and the balsamic.\nI had the Southwest Chicken salad... it came with pickled jalapenos!  That really added a nice dimension.  The chicken was perfectly grilled and served hot on my salad.  I like it!  I don't like when the chicken is cold.  Anyways...\n\nOverall... I'll be back.  I'm digging the \""new digs\""."
3282	0	a	Let me start by saying this venue is beautiful and has a lot of potential. However, if I ever return or recommend this place to anyone, it's because the staff has been either replaced or retrained. \n\nI've been here twice. The first time wasn't terrible but there were some things that bothered me. I had a table outside with some friends but went to the bar to grab a drink. I asked the older brunette bartender about some wine. She did not know where any of them were from. Ok... If there was a big wine list this would be understandable. But there were maybe 20 wines? I ended up ordering the riesling which was delicious. I ordered another glass with our server outside but when I got the second glass it was a completely different wine and in a champagne glass. (and no, it was not a champagne). I had to go back to the bar and get the right wine with the bartender who was hitting on my friend.  \n\nBecause the venue was so beautiful I decided to try it again. While enjoying some drinks a man offered to buy my friend and I a drink which we accepted. After bs-ing for a few we decide to get our check and leave. Well, the same older brunette bartender put the mans drink and his entire parties on my tab. I tried to get her attention multiple times but she was distracted by her phone. I ended up paying it and leaving, it was not even worth the extra trouble. If you like being served by someone who knows what they're doing, stay away from here.
3283	0	a	"We arrived excited and hungry, the decor was nice but very cookie cutter \""trendy Vegas\"" set-up. We noticed plenty of room inside but the hostess told us it would take 40 minutes to sit inside or we could choose to sit outside and get seated immediately so we chose outside, 10 minutes later a couple arrived and got seated in one of the many tables inside meanwhile we froze outside. We ordered almost immediately but waited over 45 minutes to get our extremely salty cup of seafood risotto and lobster fettuccini that had a little over a teaspoon worth of lobster In it. We noticed a group of people get their food faster than we did and they had only been there for about 20 minutes. Overall the food was bad and pretentious, overpriced and under portioned. Will never return. Places like this are taking the joy out of eating out."
3284	0	a	Wow.  Super disappointed. Marginally edible food. Poor service. (Minimal understanding of product or preparation). No chance of a return.  No one running the zoo. No welcome, no thank you, no fu...just a big check for food most of which we left on our plates. Didn't think this could be worse than Kennedys. I was sooo wrong.
3285	0	a	We experienced overpriced and underwhelming entrees that included the smallest portioned and most watery Seafood Rissoto with the tiniest of muscles and clams we've ever encountered. The Sea Bass was dominated by the taste of olive oil, although a quality piece of fish, and was too small for the price. Our appetizers, Tomato salad and Endive and Beets salad, were pretty good - especially the former. It took too long for entres to arrive while we had to remind the server about our second and side dish. Don't expect to see a wide beer selection. We won't go back.
3286	1	a	"We stumbled across this new restaurant/lounge the other day after lunch. Such a FAB vibe!! Even empty it's waaaay cool. From the chandelier collection over the bar, to the really great painting, wallpaper graphic? on the back wall. Someone took some time & EFFORT to create this space that much is clear.\n   So last nite for a GNO we headed for Whisk~ very buzy for a Thursday and this is a huge space so I was happy that business is going so well for a new restaurant.\n    We sat at a hi top table that could seat 8/10 people, although we were 3, others were at the table and were perfectly welcoming. \nThe menu is also creative, we started with a Cheese & Crostini appetizer. Nicely presented with candied walnuts, blue cheese, white cheddar, honey comb, strawberries, blueberries & raspberries, a fig jam, crostini a and a cheese that we couldn't ID, but tasted good. *a nice touch would have been for our server to go over the selection when she brought it, just a thought!  From there we sharedthe Mushroom Risotto . Simply DEEEELISH & the portion was GIGANTIC!!!! so perfect for sharing . \nThe dessert was a BIG DISAPPOINTMENT!!!!' Sounded wonderful chocolate donut with cappacino ice cream. The donut looked like a day old from Albertsons and was tasteless the other donut looked like a cake donut but had an odd glaze(?) on it. The entire plate was ODD! DEFINATLTY THIS PART OF THE MENU REQUIRES RETUNING!!!!!! \n\n   The drinks are WONDERFUL  a nice menu selection of cocktails & wine & beer  options too. \n \nDEFINATLY will go back and recommend you check out this \""new\"" addition to the District."
3287	1	a	New favorite brunch spot in Green Valley!! Brought my little boy here and he loved the bacon and eggs. My bagels and lox was delish. Sat on the patio. Great place!!
3288	1	a	I was excited to see another business take over the spot that Kennedy's held. The decor is what won me over initially and I couldn't wait to try the food. (Fingers crossed it would match the amazing atmosphere)..... Whew! My octopus appetizer was delicious, as was my boyfriend's corn soup (yes, we shared... Kinda. I ate his and he thankfully wouldn't touch my yummy octopus) the heirloom tomato and burrata salad was perfect and his southwest chicken salad had a surprising kick. We will definitely come back again.... Most likely for brunch, which I hear is delicious! Very happy to have this little gem in Henderson!
3289	1	a	This place is amazing. Love the bartenders, love the food, love the drinks, love the ambiance. Great addition to the district.
3290	1	a	This store always has what I need at the best prices,I've never had a problem here and I return items quit alot,The staff are always really cool and helpful.
3291	1	a	Try the duck noodles and the esan classics! I loved the som tam and BBQ chicken. They have many choices to try I will have to go back after work and try them again. The service was very friendly and everyone was smiling.  I can't wait to go back, I'm glad they are open late so I can get to go orders.
3292	1	a	Very delicious food. I found this place in yelp with good rating, and they didnt dispointed me. The service is 5-star too. Best Thai food I've ever had.
3293	0	a	I went to this Dr. De Andrade for some sensitivity on one of my tooth. His office staff is very very rude. Once I was there he tried to sell me $2000 worth of surgery I did not need after I got a second opinion.
3294	0	a	The only interest DeAndrade has is in your insurance coverage..A lousy, rude office staff who equally doesn't give a crap about you..DeAndrade keeps you waiting in the chair for 40 minutes because he is so busy selling his procedures to potential clients sitting in his other rooms. If you have rotten gums, that doesn't mean you go to a rotten dentist..If you use DeAndrade you indeed have found a rotten dentist. Avoid at all costs.
3295	0	a	I had work done by him. He is crude and disgusting at best. After he had my cash in his pocket, his whole attitude changed. He could have cared less. Typical Vegas type. \nDo yourself a huge favor ......avoid him at all costs.
3296	0	a	I absolutely love this Starbucks. Don't get me wrong. It has never ever upset me until today at 11:30 am when I entered the drive thru. Not only did the girl working the headset RUSH me through my order, which is a huuuuge pet peeve of mine, but she clearly wasn't listening either because I asked for an iced caramel macchiato with soy for my passenger and a bacon breakfast sandwich. I was given a half frozen breakfast sandwich and a hot caramel macchiato. As I handed the drink back and told her that it was supposed to be iced she took it back without saying ANYTHING to me. We decided we would leave the sand which part out because she seemed so busy even though there was only one car in the drive thru behind me...and we thought we would just warm it up at home. I was expecting some kind of sorry or something sympathetic when she came back with our iced drink but she didn't say one word...at all! AAAANDD to top it all off she gave me an iced caramel macchiato with MILK. Very displeased with this visit, on our way home we passed the Starbucks on Thomas and scottsdale, and they were very honored to give my friend a new drink and a new sand which for free with no RUSHED feeling. Brownie points to the Scottsdale and Thomas location! But gold water, you need a new drive thru girl.
3297	1	a	Two words: drive through. Two more words: quick service. Six words: plenty of tables to do work. \n\nThis new Starbucks is definitely my favorite in the area. They did it right. It's fast, friendly and offers service for those on the go who don't want to get out of their car and those who need to do some work at a desk. The food and coffee is the same as every other Starbucks but this one stands out because of the drive through and spacious interior.
3298	1	a	My sister and I came in today to look at the store and Rudy helped us. He was very professional and knew his products well. I would definitely recommend this store for all your flooring needs.
3299	0	a	This place is the worst  - has the potential to be best but they have blown it.  You order and pay for your tile, and they tell you they have it all in stock but when you go to pick it up, they dont have it and tell you that you have to drive to another location to get the rest !!! Really????  they refuse to transfer inventory between locations as needed and expect the customer to drive all over the city tracking down the missing pieces of an order that is already paid for! wow, total crap and im nevver buying from these idiots again.  good luck.  If you buy from them, make sure you leave with your entire order  same time as you pay.
3300	1	a	Very unique, friendly staff, awesome food, not greasy at all. And the sodas do not contain high fructose corn syrup! Thats a win in my book! Definitely going back!
3301	1	a	A quick trip to pick up a burrito lead me to Presto and an amazing sausage combo calzone next door instead. Great food at a reasonable price, friendly people and cool vibe.
3302	0	a	Went to the newest Crazy Pita at Downtown Summerlin today and had the worst lunch experience ever.  Stopped by at lunch time and waited in a short line.  I ordered a chicken pita and a small bottle of water for a little more than $12.00, which I thought was too expensive, but I wanted to try this place.  I was given a number and told a waitress would bring over my food when it was ready.  The place is small with a small outdoor patio area.  As all the tables inside were taken, I found a small table outside to wait for my lunch.  I waited for 55 minutes and still had not received my food, so I went inside to ask what was going on with my order.  I noticed lots of people standing around pondering the same thing.  When I went up to the counter to ask when I could expect my food, the woman next to me said  she waited about 50 minutes and received a pita that was inedible with cold fries that were so oversalted she could not eat them.  I asked what order number they were on and was told there were still 12 orders to be prepared before mine.  I lost my patience as I really didn't want to wait another hour to receive what was essentially a chicken sandwich and left.  I will never go back there.  The service is horrible, the prices too high, and, from  what I saw and heard of the food, it's definitely not worth a two hour wait.
3303	0	a	Wait time is ridiculous. There is no excuse to take 50 minutes to get a pita to a customer. We were not informed of any wait when we ordered. I watched the line extend out the door multiple times, then an employee would tell the people about the long wait and they would all leave. The place lost hundreds of dollars in revenue in the hour I was waiting there. Fries were ice cold.
3304	0	a	"Just walked up to the counter and tried to order. The girl behind the counter said \""Did you hear? All food is taking 45 minutes to come out. Would you like to order?\"" Ummm - no! How can a pita take 45 minutes? It's 1 pm on a Monday and they weren't even full! No thanks."
3305	0	a	Here's the thing, I'm here on a work trip and needed a quick lunch before I start my day. I waited 45 minutes from cash wrap to food on the table to eat when I had an entire hour for my lunch set aside. The business model is poor and not equipped to service the clientele that wants to eat at this shopping center. Tighten up your screws if you want to survive this market. Thank you for the rushed lunch and stomach ache. PS the food is OK. Not worth 45 minutes. It's just a sandwich at the end of the day or a plate of romaine...I love this type of food and would love to enjoy it on my visits, but I can't afford the time I lose. Thanks.
3306	0	a	food is really just ok. they must improve otherwise when other restaurants open at Downtown Summerlin it would be hard for them to survive...
3307	0	a	I really wanted to like this but there were some things that were lacking to give Crazy Pita a higher rating. I went on 10/20 in the late afternoon the place had steady traffic but not packed. First, the service....was friendly and attentive. The server came to my table a couple of times to check up on my needs and always had a smile.  Next, the wait and price.....I order a falafel pita which cost 12.95 w/a drink it also came with a small order of fries but that's kinda on the high side in my opinion.  The order took about 15 mins to get which i thought was slow but based on previous reviews I guess is pretty fast for here.  The food.....was ok....not the worst but definitely not the best and I'm pretty easy to please. I would of liked a couple of sauce options which I have had at similar Mediterranean places (spicy green, tzatziki)  Considering the wait time, and price, I can only give 2 stars, If it were around $8 and I got my food in 2 mins, I could bump it up to a 3.
3308	0	a	We dined here today. Not impressed at all!   We love Mediterranean food, especially kabobs or pitas.  We got the kabob platers. While the chicken and shrimp kabobs were pretty good the rest of the platter was terrible!  The veggies were soggy and mushy and couscous had zero flavor.  The hummus was on the runny side and the cucumber salad was nothing to write home about.   It was busy but I think that's gonna change once more restaurants open in the mall.  Also the prices were super high for what you get. We could go to Khoury's and get awesome kabob meals for the same price.
3309	0	a	Service was very friendly. They are missing the mark on food. Salad dressing is store bought. Meats are tough. Hummus is bland. Menu reads super but tastes less than average. Would not come back unless they became a more authentic Mediterranean restaurant.
3310	0	a	Came in with a nice dinner with my parents. After paying for my food I went to grab a drink and they ran out of ice and did not tell us. After bring out our food they took an additional 5 mins to grab us a fork. After complaining about the ice they just said there is simply nothing they can do. I was disappointed by the service.
3311	1	a	I love Mediterranean food, so I had to try it out. food is good, takes a while to get it, which is a good thing - it's not pre-cooked. Server was friendly, food tasted good. I hope they can keep it up.
3312	0	a	The manager Daniella called African American women the N word. I will not be eating there ever again.
3313	0	a	I ve been twice and haven't liked it either time. The lines are crazy long and by the time you get the food it's not good! The hummus come like water and the meat has been undercooked both times! Won't be back sorry to say!!
3314	1	a	A pretty good spot if you are in the mood for some Mediterranean food in Downtown Summerlin. The location is bright and airy, and has an outdoor seating area as well. Everything is made to order, so after you place your order, you'll get a table number and your meal will be brought to you. All in all, it took perhaps 10 minutes.\n\nThe pitas are served with an order of fries, which aren't really that necessary or remarkable. I actually wished that I could order my pita separately, as with the fries the cost was $8.99. (if they had an option for gyro-only for about $6.50, that would be perfect!).  There were large chunks of meat, feta cheese, olives, and cucumber within. It was very tasty, but be careful of those big meat chunks! Although tender enough, I almost choked on one because of the size.\n\nThe restaurant itself was pleasant, but I wasn't crazy about the fact that the bathrooms are located right next to the trash cans, in a small corridor, and they were 1-stall rest rooms. I can see that at busy times, there might be quite a line. They also were already showing signs of use and could have been better maintained. \n\nAll in all, it was a good dining experience, so I hope that they do well!
3315	0	a	"Went in around 8pm last night for a quick meal and the restaurant was obviously still new because the area was nice and clean. There was a family of 4 ordering before us and a couple in line behind us and a couple tables were occupied so the place was steady. Upon ordering the cashier was nice and took our order but informed us that our order will need to be placed as a take out order because they are slow tonight and will close. We asked her what time they close and she says 9pm. We also asked if we get our food as take out can we sit in the restaurant and eat the food we ordered. The cashier asked the manager who was behind her and the cashier  turned back to us and apologized and said sorry, no we can't eat in the restaurant because they are slow tonight and are going to close the restaurant. \n\nSo as we waited for our food we noticed that more people came in after us to order and it was only around 815pm. Our food finally arrives around 830pm and it was some what prompt but considering a \""slow night\"" for them I would think it would be prepared sooner. \n\nMy husband goes and asks the manager if we could sit for a quick bit since they don't close at 900pm and she says we have to be off the property by 9pm. We asked her to elaborate and clarify if \""the restaurant closes at 9pm\"" OR \""everyone has to be out of the restaurant at 9pm\"" and she says they close at 9pm.  Well she finally gave us the ok to sit and eat in the restaurant which we felt like we had to rush through the meal. \n\nI thought that this was ridiculous and completely unprofessional. Basically, and I would have to say unfortunate but worst customer service ever."
3316	1	a	For a fast food joint this place in on point! ;P My favorite is the veggie pita with fries. Very tasty. Super friendly and attentive staff. Clean and bright, too.
3317	1	a	Best espresso in the middle of uptown. Owner Paul is passionate about his espresso and customers.
3318	0	a	Well I didn't get a chance to go in because it was CLOSED on a SUNDAY at 10AM. No sign saying we'll be back, or closed for the day or anything. Just lights out. I was visiting Charlotte and looking for a local coffee shop. Disappointed I wasted time walking around the city to find a coffee shop closed on a Sunday.
3319	1	a	Tiny little cafe perfectly placed in Latta Arcade. European cafe vibe. Only place in Charlotte I found that serves this Italian brand coffee- Lavazza. Very limited seating. \n\nIt's as close to a strong Cuban cafe con leche as I can find in Uptown. The have almond milk as a milk alternative. Delicious pastries.\n\nPS- one of the baristas has a Down Under accent. Love it! Every barista that I've come across have been awesome. Very well run small business!
3320	1	a	Matt Kazam's show is awesome. My wife (early 30s) and I (40 something) couldn't stop laughing though the entire show. At the end our faces were in pain from laughing out load. We could totally relate to his jokes and his experiences. He definitely brought us back to memory lane. Even the 20 somethings had a great time. \n\nAfter the show we had to say hi and thank him for evening. He was easily approachable and took the time to chat. He was more than happy to take some pictures with us. My wife and I spent $100 a seat for a stand up comic the previous week who poked at every ethnic group and the guy wasn't even that funny in person. \n\nYou should go watch Matt Kazam's show at the Riviera. He is down right funny, he'll take you back to your childhood, and you won't be disappointed.
3321	1	a	I had heard Matt on the radio in DC, and had heard of him in the comedy circuit but actually met him 3 years ago when he did a show at our golf clubhouse, He was so funny, we came back the next year.  2 years later, I began talking to him about doing a show for my husband's 50th birthday party.  The first time I met with him to discuss arrangements, he had me laughing out loud within the first 5 minutes and I still chuckle when I remember what he said to me.  Needless to say, Matt knocked it out of the park for the party (people still talk about how funny he is) and even worked in some jokes personal to my husband.  Dare I say, he might have had even more fun than us at the show?!!  Matt is not only a naturally hilarious comedian, but a genuinely nice guy.  Corresponding with him over the course of the year leading up to our party, he was always responsive and had a genuine interest in making this the funniest show he could - he's the real deal, guys!!!
3322	1	a	"I saw Matt's show \""40 Is Not the new 20\"" and all I can say is we haven't laughed that much in a long time! You forget how rare it is to laugh over and over again until you are actually doing it and that is what made our visit to the show so much fun. Normally, there are gaps in a show where you can chat with other members of your party and have a little side conversation. Not with Matt's show! We were constantly engaged and the trip down memory lane was hysterical. We are still talking about the show and how there used to be only (3) television stations and as Matt said, \""remember when TV actually ended...\"" We came home and told our kids that joke and they just looked at us like we were aliens. We, of course, were amused to see them with that clueless look. So much fun!\n\nEveryone else at the show looked to be having a blast as well and that made it even more fun because it turned into a group event really and in many ways a celebration of our generation and the good times that we enjoyed. When Matt started talking about the Etch A Sketch and the Lite Brite toys all the heads nodding in the room said it all. All different types of people, men and women who all shared the same experience and so much of life. It was truly \""40 is Not the New 20\"". We would highly recommend this show. It is great for a couple and also a blast with a group -- especially those celebrating birthdays. I wish I had brought our group to this when I turned 40 that would have been a blast! All we can say is - keep up the great work Matt! We will be back and will be sure to send our friends!"
3323	1	a	I had low expectations of this show being as it was so new and at the Riveria of all places. This guy is funny! Some comedians take jokes too far or are borderline annoying... not this guy, hes a good balance!
3324	1	a	Wow I haven't laughed this hard in a long time! Matt is hilarious. My parents and aunts (all in the 60s) loved it - laughing the whole time. This is a great show for everyone - you won't be disappointed!
3325	1	a	A small group went last night to see him perform.  We really enjoyed the show.  Often times, it is difficult to relate to some comedians.....but this guy knows how to relate to audiences.  He even shared some of his personal life which is cool.  I'm glad he didn't use profanity.\nWe enjoyed the event and plan to go back again.
3326	1	a	My husband and I went last night with another couple. We are all in our early 40's. We laughed the ENTIRE time. This show is so fun and relatable, and brings back great memories. We saw the 10 p.m. show so it wasn't very crowded and seating was comfortable. Everyone in the room was laughing so hard throughout the show. \nMy husband and I live in Las Vegas and see a lot of comedians. Matt is definitely in our top three. Plus he's funny without being too raunchy, which so many comedians rely on these days.\nI hope more people go see this show. Highly recommend!
3327	0	a	Far below East Blvd Showmars in Charlotte. We have not bothered going back. Fries pasty, fish fishy, gyro dry.
3328	0	a	food is good, but check your order. I ordered cactus chilli and broccoli cheese soup, and I got 2 broccoli cheese soups. \nalso ordered a salad and only got spoons in my bag and no pita...  :/ I rated it so low because when I pay 20 something bucks for take out I expect it to be right. to late to drive back up.
3329	1	a	Great food and friendly service.  Try the hippie style oatmeal as a twist to the morning
3330	1	a	I have only eaten there 3 times, but the three different sandwiches i ate were DELICIOUS!  The cookies are amazing, if not finite in amount, and huge!  Definitely becoming a regular!  The fact that they have a Telluride location is just icing on the cake!
3331	1	a	Original breakfast sandwich with bacon was Really good! Great ciabatta roll. Jerry the owner is very personable. Will be back.
3332	1	a	Wow!  This hidden gem of a deli is fantastic!  I went for lunch and was not disappointed!  Sandwich was wonderful. Really no complaints..if i had any suggestions it would be a bigger serving of side coleslaw. Affordable, friendly, and fast too!  Cant wait to go back!
3333	1	a	The Chipotle of pizza's pretty much! You go in and you get to choose whatever sauces, cheeses, and toppings you want, all for the same price and they bake it within 5 minutes. The girl working there, Ariana,  was really nice and very helpful. I think I gave her a hard time because I had no idea what I wanted, but still very nice. Overall, great food, chill atmosphere, nice people.
3334	0	a	Went in to get a salad and a pizza with my friend today, the lady making our salad was flinging food everywhere while mixing it and put so much dressing on it, that the leaves were wilted before we even started eating it. We couldn't even finish the salad. She also got her dirty hands all over our bowls from making a pizza right before. We also ordered a pookie and she forgot to ring me up for it and then 20 minutes later, she asked for my card to charge me for it and start making it. Then 10 minutes later she tells me the ice cream is all melted and it won't work on top. I told her we were already done eating and I just wanted a refund on my pookie. She acted put out and that she had to find her manager across the street and I said, ok never mind I guess, and she said, sorry, and walked away.
3335	1	a	So I really enjoyed my visit/try of this establishment though slightly mixed review. The pizza was really good (especially for the price) and the overall atmosphere was nice with a friendly vibe. The staff that we interacted with were very friendly and helpful. The lass who made and delivered our pizzas was great.\n\nNow the negative, the restaurant was pretty empty while we were there yet most of the tables needed a wiping and the floor needed  a good sweep. \n\nWould come again. Hopefully they can keep it tidier.
3336	1	a	The Lil Things made two things for my wedding. Lara (owner) made me both a cake topper and a hairpiece. Both were made completely by hand and turned out so beautifully! They were EXACTLY what I wanted, and Lara made sure to incorporate special attention to both projects. She even texted me photos as she was purchasing supplies, to make sure that we were on the same page. Everything turned out so great!
3337	1	a	RECOMMENDED: Smashburger rocks!  The food is made fresh and to order. The staff is super friendly. It's no surprise that this chain is expanding fast.\n\nMy personal favorite is the Truffle Mushroom Swiss Big Smash!  The organic arugula adds the perfect flavor. If I've been extra good, I'm happy to reward myself with either their smash fries or a butterfinger hand spun milkshake.
3338	0	a	Just did an order to go and they completely screwed up my burger, they ignored everything on the order except for the bun.
3339	0	a	It took fifteen additional minutes, after the rest of the food had already come, to get my son's fries. They were part of the kid's meal, which we clearly ordered, but they didn't come out with the rest of the food, and then the guy who TOOK OUR ORDER seemed genuinely confused when I asked where the fries were.\n\nAlso, if I'm paying a extra dollar for bacon on my burger & they say I'll get three slices of bacon, why would they chop one slice of bacon into three little pieces and tell me they've given me three slices? It's misleading; I wouldn't have paid one dollar for so little of an extra item. They suggested next time I order EXTRA bacon! For another EXTRA dollar! \n\nHow about no. And how about I don't come back.
3340	0	a	Some pretty nice things in here.  However with the store just opening not a single sales associate said hi or, as we walked past the main checkout area again no greetings.  Not off to a great start.
3341	0	a	Made the mistake of coming back a second time to purchase a dining table.  First time was a nightmare (see Ashley Furniture Henderson review) now after pushing a delivery date two weeks already, they are calling me to notify me that the table will be delivered but no chairs are available for another three months... What the hell am I supposed to do with a dining table and no chairs.  This company is absolute garbage.
3342	1	a	The week of grand opening I finally came here to eat during lunch. Finally we have a Smashburger near my work! Food here is great! But today, instead of fries, I got the fried pickles...not a huge fan. If you like pickles, you might like it!
3343	1	a	Five stars always given when we have no complaints! For our first visit we each had different burgers which were as they claim, tasty & juicy! The sweet potato fries were good and crispy as were the shoestring onions, and we both had their gourmet HD shakes which were delicious. Food presentation is nice and simple. The staff was friendly and the service fast and accurate. The place is new and modern. It's a little pricey ($28 for 2 people) but worth the cost for better quality overall. We hope this Metrocenter location survives a long time.
3344	0	a	2 parts to this review. \nFood - delicious. Love love love the truffle burger. Everything is top notch. And service is excellent. \n\nLocation - (why the 2 stars) - west Peoria Ave location sucks. air conditioning is too freaking COLD. Has been since this place first opened. And I'm not talking oh a little chilly. It's way beyond that. First visit we froze. If it was a typical summer evening, no problem. On our second visit we mentioned it to the girls taking orders and they stood there, no reply, blank looks on their faces. The girl who brought our burgers said corporate sets the temperature.  On third visit, a girl told us 3 repair companies couldn't find the problem. And she said the bathrooms wer hot. SO, last week I called before driving over and was told the cooling system was better but not fixed. SO, we went to the west thunderbird location. Much more comfortable. \nNote to management, please please fix the problem. Cause we love your burgers!!
3345	1	a	Just opened 2 days ago. I know it will make very good business- much needed in the area. Right inside the miracle mile mall of planet Hollywood
3346	1	a	It's open. It's chipotle. A little on the small side but there's extra seating in the mall.
3347	1	a	We come here several times every time we're in Vegas and it's always amazing. Everything is so fresh, it tastes even better than at home!
3348	0	a	"We were really excited. I mean really excited for this restaurant to open. We eagerly watched the remodel from Table 49 to Fiesta Mexicana and were so happy to have another restaurant near our house. We went in for dinner and as we were walking up to the front door, noticed a lot of after-dinner mint wrappers and cigarette butts on the ground. Sad that customers littered but it detracted from the beautiful building and gorgeous outdoor seating. We were greeted quickly at the front door and the inside has been completely remodeled with lots of uniquely hand-painted chairs and booths. \n\nThe restaurant boasts \""authentic\"" Mexican food but it is more like American-Mexican food similar to ordering at a chain restaurant. We were expecting more of an eclectic Mexican menu. We were happy to see octopus on the menu but that's where it stopped. No machaca. The menu consisted of burritos, tacos and the sort with rice and beans. \n\nChips and salsa came quickly after we sat down but there were only about 12 chips in a small hot dog basket. The salsa was very good and we ordered seconds which we received quickly. \n\nDrinks were a beer and pi\u00f1a-colada which were good. We tried to order a skinny margarita but were told it included soda, agave, tequila and standard margarita mix which isn't \""skinny\"" so we passed. I'm not sure that the waitress understood what the bartender told her so we'll let that go. \n\nWe ordered the fiesta burrito and the Mexicana burrito. The portions are very large and are a good price for the size. Both had skirt steak which was overcooked and a bit dry and smothered in sauce. Two of us liked the mildly spicy sauce and one thought it could be hotter. Rice and beans were fine. The burritos were okay. \n\nWe also ordered the seafood salad with the dressing on the side. What came was a plate of romaine lettuce with a lot of plain shrimp and 5 pieces of krab on top. There was no skimping on the amount of shrimp and they were big! But they still had the tails on so we had to take the time to shell the tails off each one before it could be eaten. When I asked the waitress for the dressing she first said it didn't come with any. When I pressed her that the menu said it came with a spicy ranch, she returned and said they were out. I ordered a side of guacamole to help with the bland taste but it was very bland too and I had to add salt and lime juice! The salad had no taste and was more like a shrimp cocktail on a bed of romaine with no cocktail sauce. I would not recommend it. It had absolutely no taste. \n\nThe waitress was friendly and checked on us but nothing that would bring us back. We hope some of the issues are because it just opened but due to the collaboration of everything, will stick to our other two Mexican restaurants nearby. Bummer."
3349	0	a	Food is over priced and the wattress didn't understand english, will probably not go there again.  I give this Restuartant 6 months
3350	0	a	Horrible food (the most dry taco I have ever eaten and the enchilada was very chewy) and awful service, not to mention a giant cockroach walked right past us  to nibble on a piece of meat on the floor.  They didnt get our order right and we ended up having to eat it anyway because the waiter never came back to the table, then we had to look for him to pay the bill and then again to get our credit card back.  When we showed the manager the giant cockroach he just picked it up with a napkin and didnt even offer an apology.  I give them 6 months at most and then they will be out of business.
3351	0	a	We were sorely disappointed with this restaurant and will not be back!  The enchilada sauce tasted just like the can it came out of!  The burrito was a sad piece of soggy tortilla with a skimpy amount of beans and cheese.  The cheese enchiladas were okay but again the sauce was not authentic and not good!  The chips came in a hot dog dish without even a piece of wax paper between them and the basket.  The table wasn't clean when we got there and when I asked for the last patron's remnants to be wiped off, the person who seated us came back with a napkin which of course did not sufficiently clean the table.  And who, in this day and age, charges for refills?  A restaurant that does not expect repeat business, that's who!  The only reason we are giving them a second star is because the live mariachi band was indeed entertaining and our server was attentive.  The food... forget it!
3352	0	a	The worst dining experience of my life. The wait staff was god awful. I'll never come back unless I plan on wasting 2 hours of my life waiting for mediocre frozen enchiladas. This place fucking blows.
3353	0	a	Surroundings were very festive, but the music was blaring. I ordered one shredded beef taco with rice & beans, my friend ordered a cheese enchilada. I was served a hamburger taco in a pre-made taco shell (the kind out of a box) with the smallest serving of rice & beans I have ever gotten at a Mexican restaurant. My friend was served the same exact thing. She did not send hers back, but I did (If I am going to eat a hamburger taco, I will make it at home, NOT pay $9.95!). I could swear the waiter rolled his eyes as he picked up my plate. I will never go back here again, and I usually will give a place a second shot. Do yourself a favor, if you want a delicious Mexican food meal, go to Nando's or Manuel's!
3354	0	a	I wish I read the reviews before trying this restaurant! \n\nWe ventured to the Fulton Ranch Promenade to try this Mexican Restaurant. We never had a chance to try the other restaurants in the same location that seem to stay open less than a year.\n\nMy husband and I ordered water with lemons and were disappointed to see that his lemon slice had a large black spot on it, and my lemon slice had several brown spots on them. Yuck, I don't want to squeeze that into my water. Why would you serve this to a customer?\n\nOur server spoke less than five words to us. We understand English is not her primary language. However, she could have been cheerful and welcoming towards us, especially with our small children.\n\nYes, the chips arrived in hot dog baskets. The busboy was prompt and friendly, however, the chip basket was so small - he could not help but touch the chips with his hands while serving.\n\nThe food tasted similar to frozen food entrees I had the pleasure of eating while I was in college....I thought those days were gone. \n\nWe look forward to the next restaurant that opens in this location.
3355	0	a	"I have to agree with the other complaints. I was excited for a Mexican restaurant to be close to my house.  I judge Mexican food by the Chili Rellanos. Theirs was way too hot and I LIKE hot, but CR's are not supposed to be hot. They left the seeds in the Chili Rellanos.  So I am back to driving to the \""hood\"" for real Mexican food!"
3356	0	a	"I think they need to change the name from \""Authentic Mexican\"" to \""Authentic Microwave\"".   I had the worst Chili Relleno of my life.   We got there just before 6 on Friday night and the place was packed with people waiting to be seated.  We chose to sit at the bar on the outside side.   It was dark and the lights out there were not working.  Seeing the menu was close to impossible.       We ordered 10 dollar Cadillac Margaritas which were the bar $5.95 Margarita with a Grand Mariner side shot.   No special Tequila.  We then ordered our food........my chili Relleno and my husband's chili verde burrito.   When the food came within 5 minutes the red flag went up.   There is no way to make a chili Relleno in less than 5 minutes.  Really???  It's was COLD on the INSIDE.   Best part of my meal......the rice.  Sad!    My husbands chili verde was tender but someone in the kitchen spilled an entire shaker of salt on it.    A very disappointing $50.00 dinner.   Won't be back."
3357	0	a	Terrible! Don't waste your time (we waited over 45 minutes for our food) and your money (overpriced). When the waitress finally showed up we ordered margaritas. It tasted OK but barely had any ice (rocks) to keep the drink cold. We ordered chicken fajitas, a kids meal with chicken strips and fries. The fajitas were so over cooked that the onions were black, charred and petrified. The chicken I could have put a dent in a wall if I threw it and the rice and beans weren't even warm. Assuming the microwave was broken! Now for the kids meal.. How do you mess that up? The strips were almost black they were so over fried, AND neither the fries or the chicken was even warm .. COLD AGAIN.... It gets worse from there. When we told the waitress about the food she apologized  and said that they are so busy and that so many things were broken in the kitchen and that we were even lucky to get our food when we did as orders were so backed up. We never saw a manager coming around to see how things were. Especially given the fact that it is a new restaurant you'd think you would see a manager. Our waitress offered to send he food back but after waiting 45 for food, we just wanted to leave. We paid our $50 tab we left and will never be back!
3358	0	a	Very disappointing.  I would actually give this place a zero but yelp requires at least one star. This place is over priced and under staffed during dinner hours which caused significant delay. The food was warm at best and had to send my son's plate back because it was cold. They corrected the cold chicken fingers by dumping them back into the deep fryer. They were inedible at that point. I'm very excited to see what restaurant will move in next.....it's just a matter of time.
3359	0	a	"horribly disappointing\nour food arrived an hour after we ordered. It was cold. it did not resemble any \""authentic mexican food\"" 8 have ever had. We will not return."
3360	0	a	Not for large groups. We didn't get half of our drinks. Asked several times. We asked several times for silverware. We ended up getting it ourselves. Our food order was all wrong. Half of our group didn't get what they ordered. Good for those who got theirs right. Women's restroom had no toilet paper and no paper towels. While some in my group may go back, I will not.
3361	0	a	I would give this restaurant no stars! It was awful! The owner was mean and didn't believe my husband and I that there was a fruit fly that flew out of his rice. The owner insisted he didn't have flys or Mosquitos in his kitchen. He was rude and showed no customer service. I read several reviews on here on the lemons and mine had black spots on them as well. When I ordered my food it was very bland and cold! We had to wait to eat our food because the waitress didn't give us forks right away and we had to continue to wait for everything. The forks, the check, the drinks, etc. I would never eat here again. Customer service goes along way. Oh, and the sign outside says authentic mexican food but there is nothing authentic about it. It taste like Taco Bell. I order a beef chulupa and got some kind of mystery meat.
3362	0	a	Went tonight for a quick dinner which turned out to be over an hour.  Nice decor, very clean but the very slow service (40min wait for our entrees) was way too long.  Never saw the waitress again after we placed the order until it was time for the check.  When the food arrived, it was only lukewarm and despite my attempt to flag down a waiter to refill our drinks, we were basically ignored.  Can't see this place lasting any longer than the other places that have been it this location, will not return.
3363	0	a	"This place was an all around disappointment.  \nWe were greeted with an empty lobby got to stand and wait for a couple minutes til someone came up and said \""two?\"" No personality.  \nThe interior decor is very loud and old school, it \njust has a cheap feeling to it.  \nThe menu is the same way, loud, hard to read and jumbled.    \nServer was extremely bland and really didn't have much knowledge of the menu or Mexican cuisine for that matter.  \nWe had hopes that the food would make up for the downfall in other areas, no such luck \nThe chips were very bland and cold, the salsa was \nfreshly made but bland and way over-onioned.  \nWe ordered fajitas, if a restaurant can do great fajitas, we figure the rest of the menu will be great.   \nNo dice, minimal amount of meat, small chunks of overcooked and bland meat made it a huge disappointment.   Can't believe I'm saying this but I'd head to Garcias before I went here.   \nQuite a disappointment to say the least."
3364	0	a	I wanted to like this place....I really did!    It's the 3rd restaurant in this space in the 11 years we've lived in the area.  A fresh, bright and colorful interior change was so welcoming as was the 'full house' on our first visit.  The service was 'ok'....I cut them some slack because of it being a very busy night and the place being fairly new.  However, our waitress chose to stand and talk to the table next to us telling them about her life, rather than complete our order.\nThe first bit of food arrived - nothing to brag about.\nOur entrees arrived and were kind of tossed onto the plate.  Mine was barely warm (I am a stickler for hot food being served hot - don't just warm the plate and call it acceptable).  We decided we'd give it a try another time.\nThe second visit was similar to the first, except that there wasn't a large crowd, there were empty tables and yet we had about a 20 minute wait.  We sat at the end of the bar where servers were constantly coming up to get drinks for customers.   A big annoying.\nThe food service wasn't prompt nor accurate and once again, the plates were slopped up with food and sauce, barely warm and noting to brag about.\nI won't go back.  I give it a couple of months longer and they too will close their doors.\nIf I had to guess, I would say most of the food is prepared ahead of time so it's not really 'fresh'.   Nothing is loaded with flavors...pretty bland and boring\nThe location is fantastic!   Lots of homes around the area...a mixed crowd of young families and a senior community.   Seniors go out to eat and we like places close to home!!! !
3365	0	a	DISAPPOINTED!!!!  I went here at 8:00 on a thursday night.  I ordered the turkey, avocado and bacon on focaccia , a cannoli, parmesan chips and water.  First of all, they were out of focaccia, so I had it on a baguette.  Then, when i got to the window, she told me they were out of cannoli so she offered me a mousse dome.  Then she came back and said they were out of that.  So I got a brownie.  \nThe chips were stale.  Like they had been sitting out all day.  There was NO bacon on my sandwich, and the bread was tough tough tough. \n I will give them the benefit of the doubt and maybe try once more, but for the price, it was definitely not worth it.\nOne more thing...it is October 9, they were completely decorated for...CHRISTMAS!
3366	0	a	No WiFi.  Not impressed with the salad that I had (Citrus Turkey).  All salads are pre-prepared so they're not fresh at all.  \n\nLots of staff on break (3) and they take up 2 of the booths that customers would love to use.  LOTS of trash on the floor (a pet peeve of mine).\n\nI expected more, I suppose I set my hopes for a good bakery too high.
3367	0	a	20 min and no food. \nIs it because I'm Mexican?? I could not eat my food with the people I came with. Also too many teenagers working here I had to hear one little girl complaining about how her ride had been there for 45 minutes and how she just wants to eat and get out of there and a teenage boy was sitting in his dirty uniform with a friend who had come to see him and they both had dumb smile on their faces staring at everyone like they knew something about the food we didn't.
3368	0	a	"I had a bad feeling from when I walked in the door and saw that they were selling a $1500 Christmas tree.  Seriously? Are they expecting Bill Gates to walk in and be like, \""Hey, I could really go for a reuben...and a Christmas tree.\"" People don't go to a bakery to buy Christmas trees, just like they don't go to Home Depot for fine cuisine. Ridiculous. \nAnyways, on to the food. I've been there twice now and not impressed. The bread and cookies and desserts are good, but that's about it. Don't come here if you're hungry. I've never seen such a sad, paltry amount of meat on a sandwich in my life. There was literally a quarter inch on the sandwich. Maybe they're practicing rationing in expectation of the upcoming food shortage due to Ebola or something. We've had 4 sandwiches on 2 different days and they were all the same amount. My wife had the French dip and it was simply the Great Depression size serving of beef and a piece of cheese between bread.  Very underwhelming. We also tried the soup which was bland and definitely from a bag or can. Not homemade. \nFor $8 a sandwich, there better be some meat on it. This place simply doesn't cut it and the crowds will die down once people experience this. \nIf you're an anorexic hipster, this place is straight up your alley, however, if you're a normal human being who likes good value and amazing fresh made food, skip this place and go to Archie's deli instead. I guarantee you won't be disappointed and it's right down the street."
3369	0	a	Been here twice, with my hubby and we both agree, here is our take.....the order took a very long time for the amount of people in the restaurant.  The breads for our sandwiches were good, nothing to brag about but good.  The ratio of meat to bread is a joke,  the desserts are a good size and we shared, they were good as well.  Here is my rub,  the prices are just  too high for this area.  I wasn't impressed with the decor, it appeared like they were trying to pull off a Cracker Barrel , sorry it's jut doesn't work for us.  I might try one more visit for a salad, but from the earlier comment I might not.  I wish them well, but I'd rather go where I'm seated and waited on for the money we paid.
3370	0	a	"This has to be one of the worst restaurants in Phoenix. from Gum popping, over make-uped girls, terrible service, a manger that could not care more. And \""Yes\"" a $1500.00 Christmas tree. This restaurant is the perfect example of all show and no go. But in this case no substance what so ever. Now to continue the negitives......Small portions of meat on huge pieces of bread, empty containers, employees not having a clue what they are doing, and the soups have huge chunks of veggies.....My wife and I have been there twice and there will never be a 3rd. Also if they continue to continue to give bad service in this area. The adult community folks will spread the word and they will have cob webs growing with in a year.........One last few rants!! The ONLY saving grace are the parties which are really good. But the rest is just a mess and they should close this store until they get their stuff together....If you are looking for a great sandwich, soups and anything else. Paradise bakery just down the street does it right. And for even bigger and OUTSTANDING sandwiches with LOTS of meat head a little farther east to Archie's. Now before anyone gets all mad...I am NOT an ex employee or employee of any of these restaurants but my family and I know what we like and its NOT Kneaders...."
3371	0	a	I had no choice of zero stars, or that would have been the grade. Been there several times, and am waiting for why anyone would ever go there. As usual, long line, help absolutely uncourteous, then no tables to sit, finally found one with dirty plates etc, waited 10 minutes for someone to clean up. Probably should have known that food would be slow as well.Slow, 22 minutes from time of sitting down till it came, no sorry, I had to go and get it. I can see why cinnamon roll and breakfast sandwich would take that long, yikes. The food, breakfast roll had cold everything and still trying to figure out where the egg product came from, but it too was cold. Cinnamon bun was average at best. If you are looking for slow service, below average food, not done food, this is your place...and at a high price tag.
3372	0	a	I have been here twice and both times very disappointing. The first time was for lunch dining in on a Saturday. The service was ridiculously slow, they served my food to the wrong person, that person touched the food, and then they served it to me. The food was bland. The tables were all dirty, they have as many possible tables to cover every inch of that place and when they were emptying the trash, it was disgusting because of how close people were having to sit to that. Today I went through the drive thru, there weren't any other vehicles in front of me or behind me. As the girl stood at the register laughing, I had to wait 15 minutes for a dessert and a drink. That was uncalled for having to wait so long for those two items. Horrible service and not worth the money. I probably won't be returning and I will also tell others that they would be better off going to Paradise Bakery if they want that type of food.
3373	0	a	Well, been to Kneaders a handful of times since this location opened. GREAT food, terrible service. Today while in drive- I was greeted by a rude employee- not a friendly voice. \nWhen I got to the window, I sat there for 4 minutes until someone came to the window and gave me my total... Not even a hello, good morning or apology about the wait!!!! I then had to wait another 2 minutes for my drink and daughters kids meal. I was told there was a straw for her drink in the bag, when I asked... Only to realize when I left, Nope no straw! \n\nI also ordered a cinnamon roll and I didn't get it! \n\nWow- not a good experience at all!!!!!
3374	0	a	"I was so excited for this location. The first time I came here, I was immediately pleased by the warm, pleasant and cozy atmosphere. Their servers were nice, but they messed up my order. They messed up two different times, with two different people. My huge order that was this confusing? A brownie. Luckily, their manager was able to fix it and actually give me the brownie that I ordered. Wonderful. I also decided to order a cup of their turkey dumpling soup, which I couldn't enjoy. Why? The turkey and dumpling soup Kneader's offers is a soup with a couple pieces of turkey and a half a biscuit in it. I was as confused as you are. Today, I decided to give it another chance and order a salad. Impossible to screw up, right? That's what I thought too. So, when I pulled up to the drive thru and the kind woman told me to go ahead and look at the menu and that'd she be with me in a minute I didn't mind much. I waited about five minutes before she finally got back to me and ordered their chicken raspberry nut salad. I get to the window, pay, and wait. And wait. And wait. And wait. To give you an idea of how long I waited: the same girl that took my order and that I paid with, opened the window and asked me if I had been helped yet about ten minutes later. Another five or so minutes go by and I finally get my food. Did I mention that I was the only car there? No one behind or in front of me. This is the last time I will ever go to Kneader's. Besides the horrendous first visit and long wait on my second, the actual salad was the last straw. The \""chicken raspberry nut salad\"" promised spinach, chicken, fresh berries, feta, candied walnuts, and onions (I ordered without onions). There were no berries and two walnuts. Seriously. I then opened the dressing and as you can see in the picture it's almost laughable. There's been some pretty bad places in surprise, but Kneader's is near the top of the list. The prices don't help much either. Do yourself a favor and go somewhere else. Even Paradise Bakery is better than this place."
3375	1	a	Amazingly fresh, friendly, and clean!  Sophia Stucki took extremely good care of us. She knew everything on the menu and explained to us patiently. The ambiance was extremely nice. We are excited that they have moved in the Surprise area!
3376	0	a	After having a decent breakfast at another location last year I decided to drive up from Buckeye(1/2 hour) on Monday (12/01/14). Waited in line for a few and when it got to be my turn the gal behind the counter immediately said we are not serving breakfast.  I said why not. She said it is past 11. I said what time is it now? She said 11:03. I had already been waiting in line.
3377	0	a	TERRIBLE SERVICE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! We will never go back. They couldn't get our order right again. When I told them about it they wouldn't do anything about. We are done. Been there 3 times now and all 3 times has been bad. To have a good successful business you MUST have good customer service with smiling faces. You sure don't see that there.
3378	1	a	Good juice
3379	1	a	I loved this gym so much that I signed up even though I'm under contract at another gym, I love the decor, the staff is amazing, Joanne is the greatest trainer, tough but sweet! The best part of this gym is the one on one care you get and the sauna is heaven!
3380	1	a	"This is not your typical gym.  If you like gyms that are smelly, overcrowded and you're just another body scanning in, then you probably won't get this place.  If you want to be greeted by name in a fitness center where they really care about your goals and what your story is, then you must stop by and see what Elements is about.\n\nFrom the moment I stopped by just to \""check things out\"", I have been treated most graciously by every staff member.  These are real people that own/manage this center.  \n\nThe Benefits:\n\nFull Fitness Assessment - No, I didn't like some of the numbers I saw, but      you have to know where you're at, so you know where you need to go.\n\nFREE Session with the trainer to introduce newbies like me to the machines and the proper way to use them, this was priceless to me, as it took away the intimidation factor.\n\nYou get to choose the pricing/fitness plan that fits your needs, no one size, one price fits all here.\n\nMachines - The machines are new, well kept and very easy to use.\n\nClasses -  They have interesting and fun classes.  Yoga, Pilates/Pilates Barre, Zumba, Toning and Stretching, the list goes on as they keep adding new classes based on interest.  The instructors are amazing as well.  It is quite obvious they were chosen with much care and are highly qualified in their specific certifications.  \n\nWhether you're a recovering couch potato or a fitness godess, there is something here for you."
3381	0	a	Went there with my partner, was going to go to the Chipotle next door but this place had just opened up.  The pizza, pasta, and salad are all the same price - and assumable the same size - so we got two pizzas and a salad thinking we'd share the salad and have more than enough pizza to bring home as leftovers.\n\nThe pizza ordering experience is similar to ones we'd had in Vegas, basically choose your crust type, sauce, cheese, meat, veggie / other topping.  It's the same process for the salad and pasta, same sauce / veggie / other toppings as the pizza.\n\nThe pizza itself is quite good. The crust has a unique and delicious flavor that, in and of itself, would be worth coming here.  The toppings and cheese are fresh and delicious.\n\nThe salad, on the other hand, at the same cost as a pizza, is ridiculous.  It's a small side salad at best, even adding a number of toppings.  Although, again, the veggies are fresh and delicious, it's 10 bites at best.  Considering this isn't a side, but something someone would order as their entree, paying $8 for this just isn't justified remotely and almost ruins the whole experience.\n\nThe ambiance is quaint, nicely designed, until you realize an entire wall is dedicated to showing their awesome social media postings with flashing LED strips.  So basically think 4 or 5 TVs, each devoted to one social media outlet, with rolling positive reviews raving about the pizza.  When you step back and look at everything, this part of the restaurant is clearly out of place.  I don't need to be force-fed a restaurant's positive reviews while attempting to enjoy the food.
3382	1	a	This place is like subway or chipotle.  Pick pasta, salad, or pizza and then all your sauces, cheese meat, and vegetables.  Lots of choices, wish they had a few more toppings.  Cooked while you wait-- fast!  I'll be back for sure.
3383	0	a	I was not impressed by this restaurant.The staff was friendly and the food was quick. However, the ingredients were not anything you couldn't throw together yourself and make at home for the same cost ( and personally this pizza lacked all flavor.) I most likely will not dine here again.
3384	1	a	The Sweet Potato Curry with tofu (substituted for chicken) was a wonderful post-workout meal. The sauce was rich and flavorful (you decide the level of spice) with plenty of vegetables. I've eaten at the Fitchburg location several times, so I was overjoyed to see them open in my neighborhood. The space is quiet and comfortable with a mix of booths and tables. Place your order at the counter and they bring your meal to your table.
3385	1	a	Very tasty! \nThis is the first time I've been to curry in a box and I have to say that it was pretty yummy. \nAfter checking out the many different options on the menu I went with the panang chicken curry. \nIt had zucchini, squash, chicken, carrots and peas with a little kick of a curry sauce added in.\nLunch date had the peanut delight which was very good also but too much peanut for me. \nIt was good to switch off from one to the other when the panang got a little spicy. \nThe service was extremely quick and the food came out piping hot! ( be careful if you are too excited like I was)\nThe dishes were accompanied by a bowl of white rice that was cooked to perfection. \nOne thing that kind of sucked was the parking. But well worth it to wait for an open spot :)
3386	1	a	(*-*)
3387	0	a	I wasn't impressed with this place. Going to a sushi joint, you always have to be prepared to pay through the nose but here the price simply wasn't worth it. Two and a half people, lunch, $65.10 - and that wasn't including the tip. The food wasn't all that great (RA Sushi in Old Town or Tokyo Lobby in Glendale are far better), but the prices here are just nuts. $12 for a rainbow roll - really? (Tokyo Lobby have them for $10). Even the nigiris are a half buck or more over what they should be charging. $5 for two small pieces of fish and let's face it, 80% of the damn thing is plain boiled rice. They even nickel and dimed us an extra dollar just because we switched one roll to soy paper from seaweed. And a tiny cup of green tea was $2.75.\n\nDefinitely not coming back, I'm afraid. I'd rather make the trip to Tokyo Lobby (which IS the best sushi in the West Valley IMO) where the food tastes better and the prices are more reasonable. I guarantee Uni won't survive in Surprise, not with prices like this and especially not in the cattycorner location they moved into, site of at least four or five other local restaurant failures.
3388	0	a	I wanted to like Uni's.  The staff is friendly and the restaurant is clean.  The original order from the Sushi selection form was lost so we were asked to complete another one.   A number of items were ordered for the four of us and the food was fair.  The order was mixed up though and food we didn't order was presented to us and other items we did order never showed up.  One meal in particular (a sushi/sashimi combo) took an hour to arrive.  The Manager was apologetic and removed that meal from the bill.  I'll give them one more try and I hope they get their act together
3389	1	a	Had an assortment of specialty rolls. Very good service and great quality sushi. We will return to sample more of the menu.\n\nOwner came over and was very nice. I hope this does well. Great location and large dining area.\n\nThe entire staff is friendly. Glad we found a good place to have Sushi
3390	1	a	After going to the wrong location, we arrived just before they were closing between lunch and dinner. The server made sure we didn't feel awkward about the timing, which was so nice!\n\nThe food was tasty and reasonably priced! If it wasn't so far away, we'd be back for sure!
3391	0	a	It's wonderful that such a nice bakery has opened in the South Hills, but until they figure out how to manage their popularity, I won't be a fan.  I've gone three times in the two weeks they've opened.  The first time I went at about 11:30 for just a baguette and I waited in line 10 minutes, behind only two people.  The next time I stopped in for a baguette about 2pm and they had none left, so I left, too. (Seriously - a french bakery should NEVER run out of baguettes.)  The straw that broke the camel's back was arriving this past Sunday at 9:30 a.m.  The line was out the door - kudos to them for their popularity - but it took 40 minutes to get served! And all I wanted was a baguette and two croissants.  They need to figure out a better system, like more staff or two registers.   If I ever see more than two cars in the parking lot, I will head straight to Giant Eagle for my bread instead.
3392	1	a	The best bakery I've ever been to! Highly\nRecommend the Almond Croissant, Ham & Cheese croissant (have them warm it up!) and any of the Tarts!
3393	1	a	Almond croissant.  You don't need to know anything else.  Just do It.\n\n(end of review)\n\nJust kidding (but not really).  When I found out La Gourmandine was coming to Mount Lebanon, to say I was stoked is an understatement.  Many times I had visited the Lawrenceville location later in the day only to find my favorite treat out of stock.  Now that they're in our back yard, it's more than easy to run for a morning pastry and a coffee (probably not a good thing for my wallet nor my waist).\n\nHonestly, everything here is solid (and from what I've heard from a few French friends, truly representative of a French pastry shop).  A word of warning...  this place gets busy during the weekend mornings and you can easily drop a small fortune on baked goods if you don't exhibit self-control.\n\nTry stopping by on a weekday morning if you can, grab a coffee and enjoy one of their pastries warmed up...  doesn't get any better than that in the South Hills!
3394	1	a	Stopped in for opening last night.  Place was busy but service was spot-on.  PT's Entertainment Group did a good job keeping the Irish theme from the previous business, while adding some of the touches you would expect from the local company we all know.  Shuffle board and pool table additions, as well as a patio area were nice touches.  \n\nThe one star from the top was for stripping out so much of the traditional Irish tchotchke that adorned the previous place and added tons of character.
3395	0	a	Stopped in soon after the conversion from Molly Malone's. My wife and I had enjoyed eating there regularly. As soon as we walked in, the stench of smoke was so strong that we walked back out. My actual rating is no stars since we did not do anything but walk in and out. We were so disappointed that the 17%  of smokers were considered more important than the other 83% of non-smokers. I thought maybe I was too harsh, but two nights ago while dining at The Lodge (which has a separate eating area from the bar), I overheard people in the next booth saying the same thing. This place is now irrelevant for me. Maybe it will change, but I'm not holding my breath, although if I ever walk in there again I probably will have to.
3396	0	a	"Okay Let me start by saying that reason I am giving this place a two star was service first thing I call to ask if they serve food all night and what the hours were the bartender on the phone was a female this is her exact words \""Yes this is a BAR we are 24hrs and serve food all day\"" I said okay thank you and she hung up no good bye or thank nada! So, I am starving I just got home from working on the strip and I work at Bar too that closes at one in the morning that is why I called to ask. My husband and I walk inside and sit right in front of the bar at one of the high tops it was 15 mins before anyone came to greet us or give us any menus. Finally, a male bartender came and greeted us he was friendly but was in a rush to get our order he just handed us the menu and asked \""Do you know what you want?\"" We needed a min and did not ask if we wanted some thing to drink or nothing just \""I assumed you been here before\"". Retarded how can you say that to a guest. So, he came around sooner than I thought to take our order the way it was going we asked for it to go. I ordered the chicken dinner with rice and veggies; my man got a bucket of buffalo wings with extra buffalo on the side and an order of fried cheese. Then he asks do you want a drink while you wait we both said no it is okay.( In my head you'd probably bring it when the food is ready anyway.)  So it took 30 to 45 mins for the bar food to come out; we had paid before hand too and had to go up to the bar to ask the bartender how much longer that's when he finally got the food. I guess he noticed we gave him 20% and was extremely fast and nice I walked out My husband stayed to get some ranch to go. When we get home his wings were PLAIN we hand to melt butter and mix it with franks to toss the wings in to make them buffalo. Other than that the food was good the veggies did not seem fresh if anything they are frozen or canned. This review got two stars because the male bartender was nice and food was okay."
3397	1	a	Every time I try to compare this with other car rental places, I always end up putting in a reservation here because they have the cheapest price, hence the name Thrifty. Since getting Blue Chip membership, it's always been a breeze picking up the car. I can bypass the dreaded long line from the regular counter inside the rental car center and just head up to the Blue Chip member window. I simply show my reservation number, sign the necessary paperwork, pick my car (love that they let you choose which one you want rather than assign one to you), and I'm on my way. My last visit brought me the quickest/friendliest service so far. For a free service, being a BC member does have its perks. I'm more than likely to book my next rental with them.
3398	0	a	Was there to pick up a car on 9/27/2010.  There was three people ahead of me and I waited about one hour for my turn.  It was a horrible experience and will never use them again.  I noticed other car rental agencies in that hub had only a few customers waiting, but maybe I got what I paid for this time.
3399	0	a	We rented a car for 3 days in Vegas a few weeks ago and I left a $500 camera lens in the center console. As soon as our flight took off for JFK I realized that it was missing. As soon as we landed I called up Thrifty and selected the menu option for lost & found... It just rang out. I then called back and selected the option to speak to a manager... it said 'Your call cannot be connected at this time'. \n\nSo, over the course of the next 5 days i kept trying to call and get through to someone. I left several messages with the lost and found at Thrifty Las Vegas after being transferred by customer service. I also had customer service email the Las Vegas outlet a couple of times. By the time I actually got on the phone to a real person at the location and they were able to search the car the lens was no longer there... well of course it wasnt!!!!! \n\nTheir response was that because I had chosen not to purchase the extra insurance there was nothing they could do. So basically... unless you pay extra, their employees can keep anything they find in your rental car. GREAT!!!
3400	0	a	My friend and I reserved a car for our Grand Canyon-Bryce Canyon-Zion National Park trip.  My friend is under 25 and spoke to someone about her corporate discount code which would cancel out the fee for being under 25.\n\nShe spoke to a rep on two occasions before the trip to confirm the code would work and that it was the right code.\n\nWhen we went to pick up our car, the code didn't work.\n\nI hate surprises, especially when it about doubles the cost we were expecting.  Maybe there was a misunderstanding on my friend's part when she called but I can't imagine how.  She called twice and she's not stupid.
3401	0	a	Very pushy upselling the extra insurance!  The counter agent actually demanded to know if I had called my insurance company and began to interrogate me about what they covered.  He insisted I give him the name of my insurance company.  Then he commenced to detail all the different ways I would have to pay more money by not buying extra insurance.  \n\nWhen I got to the car (not the model listed online, or even close) there was a big ding in the door.  I was so freaked out about extra charges I tried to report it to the agents on the lot but they said they don't take those reports anymore.  Hmm. \n\nVery unpleasant way to begin my trip.  Never again, Thrifty!
3402	0	a	Awful! Not only was the process excruciatingly slow, the staff didn't seem to care that people were in line at least 30 minutes before being served. Some people got so frustrated with the wait, they left to go to another rental company. I would have too but was next in line and already waited for close to 45 minutes.\n\nThe most disturbing aspect of Thrifty is all the required add on costs.  Just because the quote you received online was the cheapest, it certainly doesn't mean it will remain the cheapest once you get to the counter.\n\nInitial quote, $78 for 4 days. Now lets add all the extra hidden costs...\n+Customer facility charge, $15\n+Vehicle license fee, $6.40\n+Add spouse as driver, $10 (typically free at other companies)\n+Basic coverage for road side assistance, $24 (typically free st other companies). If the car dies due to mechanical issues, you are responsible fir getting it back to Thrifty if you dont get the coverage. What a bullsh* t cost. How do I know how well they maintain their cars!\n\nOn top of all this, they require a gas receipt as proof that you filled the tank at a gas station at least 10 miles away. If the meter says full, its full.  I shouldn't have to provide proof.
3403	0	a	Reserved through Orbitz with a debit card and picked up with a credit card because of their debit card policies. Their system was down so they did everything manually, approved it and I was on my way. I returned the car three days later and their computers are STILL down. They receive the car and hand write me a bill saying the card that I gave them would be charged.\n\n The next day I look at my statements and the card I gave them has been charged. I look at my bank statement and they've also charged me a deposit for a rental on my debit card, the day after I returned the car! I called them to get it straightened out because i figure it's simple human error because of their systems being down and that they can just drop the charge on my visa. \n\n I call them and they insist that i'm mistaken and I must have given them a visa. They look at the imprint of the card and go figure; it's the AMEX I paid for the rental with. Too bad though, they charged my debit card for it and they claim they can't do anything about it now (even though it's still pending). They also have a charge on my AMEX, so I don't have access to those funds either. The thing is; I never presented them my visa and they don't have a swipe, imprint or record of it other than via Orbitz. \n\n The people at the counter both times were great, but the manager Albert was rude and seemed put out that I wanted him to look into this. He had someone else call me back, presumably because he didn't want to admit his mistake, and essentially tell me to call their billing department on Monday to have them charge the Amex for the final bill and they'll refund  the other card in 5-7 days.\n\nPS: the convertible I rented was beaten into the ground. Big dents all over it. Sort of took away from the feeling of renting a flashy car when it was so beat up.
3404	0	a	They lost my reservation in the computer system Made me go to the end of the line 3 times when I got the companies customer service on the line they wanted to speak to the manage 20 minutes later he came out of his hole and told them he decided my attitude was bad and won't rent the car Manager is Mark 60 year old fat bald guy Stay away from Thrifty\n\nAfter he turned me away I walked over to Hurtz same car $50 less then my reservation price I didn't have to pay the orbitz or Priceline fee\n\nBest bet call hertz direct and reserve your car \n\nWhat ever you do stays way from dollar and Thrifty Manager Mark is in charge of both companies let me tel you he is a lazy fat butt who does nothing to satisfy customers.
3405	1	a	I booked the smallest possible car in tandem with my flight through Southwest for a weekend here, because I needed the car for one day to drive out to Red Rocks for some bouldering. Thoughts:\n\n1. Oddly enough, I tried finding prices to do just a day rental for the Sunday I'd be climbing, and it came out only five bucks cheaper than the price to rent it the entire weekend. I figured it'd be less of a hassle to just rent it at the three-day price ($75) and save cost on cabbing (~$20 each way) back and forth to the hotel (Encore). \n\n2. Omg the rental process was sooo less painful than I was expecting, thank the lord. Here's why: the McCarran Rent-a-car Center is awesome http://www.yelp.com/biz/mccarran-rent-a-car-center-las-vegas#hrid:IegKUwCfx3XMQC2kXptAjw/src:self\n\n3. The guy at the desk tried to get me to upgrade the car for $50, insisting that the economy sized one I got would be waaay too small and would barely fit four people. I was only really planning on driving myself and a friend and some bouldering pads, so I didn't care too much, but when I got to the car, it was huge! Granted, I am a smallish Filipino lady and most of my cousins/friends who I transported around Vegas were equally sized, but seriously it was a spacious Ford Fusion. Definitely never upgrading. \n\n4. All of the customer service points of contact were brusque and efficient, but none very personable (though the girl who gave me the car was pretty cute). Minus a few points for the robotic feel. \n\n5. The car had no issues although I couldn't figure out the stereo system and didn't find the trunk button til the last day. Just a note, you can easily return it with a full tank instead of paying their $9/gallon or whatever to have them do it. Within five miles of the airport, gas was $3.50 at the time of this post: no problemo!\n\nP.S. Driving around Vegas was a piece of cake. Roads are super wide and lights kinda suck, but it's all manageable. It was maybe 15 minutes from Encore to LAS and vice versa, and best of all almost every casino has free parking & free valet (with tip)!
3406	0	a	4 Stars for efficient and polite staff at Blue Chip counter, but the car they gave us was in desperate need of mechanical work.  Needed a wheel alignment and tire balancing.  Drivers mirror glass was broken, and interior could have been a little cleaner.
3407	0	a	If I could give zero stars I would. I will NEVER rent from thrifty again or let anyone I know rent from then. I have rented dozens of cars from other car rental places and never had an issue. I made a reservation weeks in advance, got to the place and had all sorts of complications. The employees were VERY rude and not accommodating.  DO NOT RENT FROM THRIFTY!!!!
3408	0	a	"(corrected Thrifty location - original review 3/7/13)\n\nOH HELLO, VOMIT ON THE INSIDE PASSENGER DOOR\n\nAsking myself where this review should begin, I decided to back way up in the trip planning. We went back and forth on whether or not it was necessary to rent a vehicle. There were two of us travelers. We didn't plan on drinking much while in Vegas so not worried about DUI, but did plan on going to Fremont Street, so lots of cab fare. Had a convention with a $10 parking lot and our hotel had a monorail station for $5. Lots of back and forth. When we finally concluded that it would be slightly more convenient to rent a car, we started searching for deals online. \n\nFound a discount code for Thrifty Auto Rental from Orbitz (I think) that stated an additional 6% savings. Husband did all the work online while on the phone with me, setting up our reservation. But he couldn't find a place to enter the discount code. Please be user friendly when making a webpage. So we figured we'd reserve the car with his credit card and bring the discount code along with us when we picked up the car. \n\nJerome was working the counter in Las Vegas and must have been having a really bad day. He was unfriendly and unhelpful. I'm a big believer in coupons and discounts and saving of the money. So naturally we brought up the code and pulled up the page on my husband's phone, with the discount confirmation number. We explained we couldn't apply this when paying and he snapped that \""if we couldn't do it, he wouldn't be able to either.\"" It was rude and unhelpful.\n\nWe went upstairs to the garage and picked up a Kia Soul. For just over $100 for five days of minimal driving it was an okay deal. Nothing special. The tank was full and I walked the vehicle, taking pictures of all dings and scrapes. I didn't think to look inside before we left. It wasn't until the next day that I saw the passenger door. What the &#$^%!! Is that vomit? A half-hearted attempt to clean the sticky, disgusting mess had been made and I made another go at it. We immediately pulled over but it didn't come off very nicely. So for five days I sat in the seat consciously reminding myself not to let my right knee touch the door. \n\nUpon returning the vehicle I pointed out the filthy door to the nice woman who checked us in. She said we should have called and we could have returned and had the car replaced. Cuz that's how I want to spend my vacation. Driving around because some employee didn't do their job? Perhaps if she'd said my call would have brought another car to me to trade... but I wasn't about to waste gas and time anyhow. Instead, I'll double check for gross interiors before leaving the parking lot."
3409	0	a	One person to help a huge line, where are the employees... Been waiting forever, 17 windows but one employees... Thanks for nothing Thrifty
3410	0	a	The worst car rental experience I have ever had, I usually only rent from enterprise because ive never had an issue in 10 years of renting but went here because it was Sunday and I had limited options since enterprise at the airport had no minivans. I would never rent here again and would recommend you use another company too. The cars are nice but 2 of the people  I dealt with should work for the dmv or some place where customer service is not needed.
3411	0	a	"Yelp needs to make a zero star review possible because Thrifty totally deserves it! I went against my own instincts and booked with them because they were the cheapest and didn't charge a one way rental fee. NEVER again. Huge line and when we started there were 4 employees working which quickly dwindled to only 2. 45 minutes later we finally got outside to actually get our car. The lady tells us to \""take any of those 3 cars over there\"". One was being cleaned by quite possibly the slowest person ever so we went to the next one,loaded all of our luggage, and then saw writing on the windshield. I asked another employee about this and he told us the car was broken. At this point the other 2 options are gone. They did upgrade us to a Mustang, but it really was too little too late. Also after driving about 20 miles, the oil change needed light came on! Please avoid this disorganized mess."
3412	0	a	Would not recommend these people at all. Took forever to get our car and there was only 2 people in line. Plus we didn't  even the car we had reserved. Why pick out a model if there not going to give you that one ? Plus the biggest thing of all they added insurance to the car even though I waived it and signed I didn't need it. Couldn't get a refund ended up costing me another $160 very underhanded be careful of this  shady business. Couldn't even talk to a person to get a refund called and called beware of thrifty unless you have Money to waste. Will never rent from them ever again and will warn all my friends and family not to either.
3413	0	a	If you want slow service?this is the place, only two people working on the day before thanksgiving really??? What is wrong with you people? You have people waiting in line for over one hour! Not cool, at all.
3414	0	a	"I read the reviews, and I thought that by enrolling in the Blue Chip program - where you provide all your information ahead of time and they have a special line for you in order to expedite the agonizing rental process - things would be better.\nNot really.\nFirst of all, good luck trying to find a listing of the hours this Thrifty is open: It's not listed on any Thrifty website. On Expedia.com, it is listed as being open to 1:00 a.m.\nSo imagine my surprise when I approached the counter around Midnight only to be told by a brusque woman at the Thrifty counter that I would have to wait over at the Dollar counter.\nSigh.\nWhen I went to the Dollar counter, there was NO line for Blue Chip members. Fortunately, when I reached the front, the guy had all the information, and kindly handed me my contract and I was out the door. Points to the guys working at the Dollar counter.\nBut in general...\nWhy is it so hard for rental car companies to get their act together? It seems that even when you take the time to enroll in their \""Frequent Rental/Painless Rental\"" programs that are designed to expedite the process, they still manage to somehow make life for the renter difficult."
3415	0	a	"Warning: rent at your own risk, unless you have alot of time to waste & don't care for poor & rude service. The poor reviews I can truly believe. I flew into Vegas to unfortunately attend a funeral. I think my flight was shorter than the total time to wait in line to wait to pick up the car & leave the rental area! I was even 40 min late attending the service since there were so many issues with the rental company. I arrived 2 hrs early into the airport prior to the service & got to the rental place in 15 min. With 2 people in front of me & a long line behind me, I finally get to the counter about 45min later. People were getting very upset & taking their business elsewhere which I should've done to spare me the headache. Only 1 representative available & the old man that helped me had poor people skills & couldn't even get into his computer because he couldn't remember his password. Time to retire, that includes his attitude! Mind you, I only asked 1 question \""is there a 1 hour grace period?\"" Imagine, I was patient the entire time & I get attitude? He answered repeatedly \""the time you check in is the time you bring it back\""...he must have had Dementia or something because I could've been good with a a \""yes\"" or \""no\"" answer, instead of his annoying parroting. \n\nAfter I finally get done with him, I go downstairs to get my car. If you have the Wild car, keep in mind prices are good because they choose your car. The attendant said to me I got the Mustang convertible. I'm sure most folks would be thrilled, but NOT IF YOU HAVE A SMALL CHILD! I brought it to their attention in the booth & the lady, Cindy, didn't care & said she would have to charge me to \""upgrade\"". I just requested a hardtop for safety reasons. Didn't realize she went ahead & charged me WITHOUT MY AUTHORIZATION.  That is totally stealing! Another rep said it was OK to go with an alternate car, I got one in a lower category with a hardtop, but still within the request I booked online. Sure enough, when I return the vehicle, there's an extra charge for my \""downgrade\"". I made a complaint by phone since no manager was readily available & I was pushed for time to return to the airport. I speak with the Thrifty phone representative, Kevin, And he says the complaint will go to the General Manager at the rental location for training purposes, but I will not be refunded. He too was not friendly on the phone the minute I said I had a complaint. \n\nWow, how is it that Thrifty hires poorly trained & uneducated staff? You stand in a forever line, get attitude for it & pay extra for a downgrade without my authorization after being told no charges will be filed? Really? My one star is for the initial rate I got & for that one Asian staff who was trying to be helpful after seeing my grief..."
3416	0	a	If i could have given zero stars I would have.  not because the people wernt nice, they were.  the cars simply were not there.  It took nearly 2 hours from start to finish to get my vehicle.  If thrifty reads these and cares, they will invest in the people and systems to not make the process so horrible.
3417	0	a	Just plain awful! After having a very bad experience with a Hertz in Waikiki I decided to try thrifty for my next rental for a Las Vegas trip. I booked the car on 1/18 (yes a month ago) and when I went to collect it, aside from the horrendous slow line...they had no cars!!! They even sent me a reminder in the morning...WTF! I went crawling back to Hertz and got my mustang with no issues. I'd give them ZERO stars if I could!
3418	0	a	Wait for my car was longer than my flight. Thrifty charges less than many of the others, but just know that you'll pay for it in wait time.
3419	0	a	I've rented here 3 times now. Never again. Huge 30 minute plus line each time, with only 2 workers at the 7 available registers.  Then they hard, hard upsell you on unnecessary insurance.  All the other agencies have no lines, likely because they charge more.  I'll pay a bit more next time.
3420	0	a	Worst rental car agency by far at Las Vegas. Expect huge line to get your car. Minimum one hour wait. Staff is oblivious to long lines and regularly takes breaks leaving one or two people to service 15 person line. Worst is a guy named Jeremy Blair who insists on getting your hotel info. Real creepy. I will never be back.
3421	0	a	Same story as everybody else. Waiting in a really long line, and only 2 attendants. They must not care too much about customer service around here.
3422	0	a	The car rental itself was fine.  It was the car return that turned into a disaster in that I left a sweater in the car.  The sweater happened to be a friend's sweater that I wanted to retrieve that day to no avail.  I called from the main airport before my flight left for Dallas - no answer.  I returned to Dallas - called them again the exact day - April 22, 2014 - and could get no answer from the locals at that location.  The national customer service line answered but could not help.  So I completed the online lost and found application.  Continued to call the local number - even the manager's number - left messages.  No return call.  My sister even visited the location on Friday for me and the sweater was never found.  Therefore, thieves work at this location.  So beware everyone.  Never accidentally leave anything in a car at this location that could be worn or used by another - because it WILL BE STOLEN.  And they will NEVER EVEN HAVE THE RESPECT OR DIGINITY TO RETURN YOUR CALLS.  These are very bad people who have no respect for their customers or their customer's belongings.  I will never rent a car from Thrifty Car Rental again in my life!!!!!  The saddest part of this entire fiasco is I was never supposed to rent from them in the first place.  My original agreement was with another car rental that had a computer problem and sent me to Thrifty!
3423	0	a	No, the blue chip program doesn't help. My wife makes the reservations, I drive. After being ignored at the blue chip window for 20 minutes we were  rudely informed we had to go wait in the other, longer, line. Turns out only the driver can be the blue chip member. Thanks for telling us up front.\n\nWent back inside waited 40 minutes for two folks working the line to find my reservation. At least the guy inside was friendly, despite being super busy.
3424	0	a	I've made the mistake of renting here twice. Each time the line was over an hour long. Life is too short. Go elsewhere.
3425	0	a	They advertise the cheapest price then can't handle the rush. \n\n11:10 pm in Vegas on 7/3/2014 in 100 degree weather and we're in line so far for 25 minutes. \n\nIf I would have spent $10 more, I could be at my hotel by now.\n\nNever again!! This is the last time I use them!  Their not thrifty - they are just plain lousy!
3426	0	a	This must be a joke.  An hour in line and an hour for the car! !  The big boys line's moving and mt.   Never Again!!
3427	0	a	Never had a problem before with any rent a car places in Vegas but this trip with thrifty was real bad. 1 hr wait as 1 agent try's to help a line 50 deep.  Then we all have to listen to this one agent try and sell insurance \nCausing the line to back up more. Never again Thrifty. Please avoid these people readers. Do not say I did not warn you.\n\nAs we left vegas I see they had the same problem.    Shame on you thrifty.
3428	0	a	Thieves. I had to make a quick stop into Vegas to see my sick mom and I rented this car as part of a package deal with my flight. The gal at the counter didn't seem like she even wanted to be there. She didn't fully explain a damn thing to me and I was in such a rush. I said yes to pre-paid gas and even though the receipt said ESTIMATED CHARGES don't buy that BS. I brought the car back FULL and I was still charged $70. I did call their customer service and got my money back but think about the folks who don't. She said you should have told the person who checked the car back in. Umm i did and he said there was nothing he could do. And did I mention what a hunk of junk the car was? It was a new Chrysler  200 and it was so dirty inside. Dusty, funk on all over the carpet and the dings and scratches on the outside. OMG. I understand the name of the car rental company is thrifty but damn have a little pride. DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY! You have been warned!
3429	0	a	BAIT and SWITCH!!! Do NOT USE.  They give out reservations left and right with the cheapest prices, but then dont have cars available.  They do nothing to accomodate you.  They even hired a security guard to control the unruly customers.  You end up spending way more by having to rent elsewhere.\n\nDO NOT USE
3430	0	a	ZERO STARS. Do not rent from dollar/thrifty at the Las Vegas airport.  I wish I had paid a dollar a day more to rent from someone else. Every customer takes 14 -21 minutes to do their paperwork (you have plenty of time to time them). I waited about 80 minutes with my young children to get a dirty car. This has to be the least efficient system I have seen in a long time.
3431	0	a	While they may list lower prices than other agencies, this comes at a cost. In our case, a line that took one hour to pass through just to get to the checkout counter. \n\nDo yourself a favor and rent from *any* other agency at the airport.
3432	0	a	"And to make matters worse, on the return they charge the wrong card - which is no biggie except that as I wait in line for 20 minutes to get that changed, an older couple literally cut in line and get served before us. Their excuse, \""we have a flight!\""  Well, so do I. But they are WHITE and I guess the Indian guy in front of me and my own \""Mexicanness\"" is not good enough to be helped first."
3433	0	a	Oh how I hate the lines and the service. Especially the service. It seems like all employees, especially the ones behind the counters of rental car companies came straight from hell. Because we book via an European agent we seldom know which rental car company we're renting from. But we know after over 30 car rentals that Dollar and Thrifty have the worst staff. Their even rude and verbally aggressive if you don't take the suggested extra's.\n\nAnd it happens not sometimes, but all the times. Not taking the insurance and road side assistance made the man behind the counter lecturing me like I was retarded. Telling me hell would break loose if something would happen and I would go bankrupt and would not be able to leave The United States. They had my creditcard and knew were I lived. I'm thinking of filing a complaint.\n\nBoth with Thrifty for the rude way I was treated as with my agent. The sell you 'a complete package' so you don't have to worry about insurance. They even tell you not to take extra's because it's all in the package. Well, I'm at least in doubt. And knowing the culture of sueing people doesn't really help.\n\nAnd to make things worse, he just added it without asking. Because I asked why I had to pay $90 extra (besides the fuell) I've notice. \n\nBut on the bright side, and that is the one star, the lady pointing out the cars was very helpfull and friendly. Even got us an upgrade because she was out of cars in our range. In the past we've also experienced that we've just had to wait untill a car came in, or we had to pay extra.\n\nAnd excuse any grammar or spelling mistakes. English is not my fist language. And if that isn't bad enough, my Apple device keeps changing the words into 'proper Dutch'. Yes, you've guessed right, my first language.\nAnd excuse any grammar or spelling mistakes.

3434	0	a	Will never rent from this place again. Rented car in Las Vegas to drive to Flagstaff AZ in my spouses name. Get to Flagstaff and my husband has a medical emergency and has to have heart surgery. When calling Thrifty to put my name on car so that I can drive it back they refuse. Tell me my only option is to have car towed back!!! I ask to speak to a manager and they say he will call me back and no call returned. THIS IS AN EMERGENCY AND I AM A LICENSED DRIVER. There has to be better options than this!!!
3435	0	a	Unpleasant experience: Waiting line 1.5 hours with half of staff going on break and not treated friendly.
3436	1	a	Rule # 1 if you dont have money dont go to vegas.  They do put  up to a 350$ HOLD on your cc.  Luckily for us it was 59$  they were pleasant renting and returning.   I lost a bag with 18 $ worth of valuables. And they searched for it and found it.   Excellent  people and they try to make you happy.   There is 1 con. Midsize sometimes seems compact.
3437	0	a	Don't rent a car from this group. Waited 45 minutes (35 people behind me in line) and was finally waited on by a rude, condescending employee (substitute other word here ). I cancelled my reservation on the spot and went to Alamo. No problems there.
3438	0	a	Ridiculously slow!!!!!!! 20 terminals but only staffed with 5 ppl...on a Saturday night!
3439	0	a	Absolute joke. 1hr check in. 40 people in line 3 agents on the busiest travel day!!!!
3440	0	a	Awful.  Crappy car with 41,000 miles didn't have a working heater or windshield washer fluid.\n\nEven when you decline coverage they charge you anyway, hoping that you won't notice or dispute it.  The dispute process is an enormous hassle and even when they say they'll credit you back, they don't, forcing you to dispute it with your credit card company.\n\nSTAY AWAY FROM THRIFTY!
3441	0	a	"I'd leave 0 stars if possible. HORRIBLE service. Nobody working. Huge line and a general attitude of \""I don't give a crap\"" from the supervisor. Avoid at all costs."
3442	0	a	I went with Thrifty because they were slightly less expensive than the competition. Unfortunately, that cost savings was at the price of guest service and service quality. First, I was directed by the manager on duty to go to another location to expedite my rental as the main counter was busy. When I got to the new location, I was treated like I had leprosy, apparently because didn't I know they had a main counter? Second, I was charged for the optional insurance twice, despite declining coverage. When I tried to change it, I was told I had already clicked the button (accept on the screen) and would have to speak with the manager to have it reversed. I went back to the main counter, which still had a line, only to be told the manager had left and I would have to call later. When I called later, I was told, you guessed it, I already clicked the button so there was nothing they could do. Well, there is something I can do. First, take my business elsewhere. Second, recommend others avoid them so they don't have to go through the miserable, time consuming, money wasting process I did.
3443	0	a	"We decided at the last moment that we'd rent a car, so by the time we reached the McCarran Center there was a long line. We checked different rental offices but the price seemed to be too high and we were left with thrifty. \n\nPros:\n1.We were not planning to drive along the Strip much, the car was just to travel to and from the airport and maybe just in case we got time to visit any nearby attractions. So this was the cheapest option and well, it served the purpose.\n2.the car was clean\n3. the gentleman at the counter was nice to us and quick to process the request.\n\ncons:\n1. while driving the car, it wasn't all that good and smooth. Had to get used to it though.\n2.there wasn't enough staff at the counter and we had to wait for a long time. Finally when we reached the front of the line, the lady at the counter left and asked us to wait for the next staff to be free.\n3.after we got the paperwork done, we proceeded to the parking lot. There was a man to check our papers and he had a very cold attitude. He said \""You can take any of the cars over there that you see\"" and he pointed to the back row of cars. There were around 8 cars in that row. So my husband tried to ask him which cars in specific he meant. The man said again \""any of the cars that you can see\""  Well.. we are not blind, we do see all the cars over there. We went over and tried to switch on two cars which looked fine. But they wouldn't start. So we went over to yet another car, it started but we were not able to adjust the seat. Finally we got a Beat, looked ok and we drove away. I wish the man just mentioned the cars which were working instead of having to make us try every cars out there at 4.00am!\n\nWhen we returned, we had just filled gas from the gas station next to McCarren and the fuel indicator read full. The staff at the drop off demanded that he see the receipt and he was adamant. We said it was full and he could check the indicator. He said it doesn't work that way. My husband had misplaced the receipt but luckily he could find it after a thorough search of his pockets. PLEASE DO SAVE YOUR RECEIPTS else they'd charge you even if the its full tank!"
3444	1	a	Love this place. A much needed addition to the neighborhood. Huge beer selection, great food, attentive, knowledgeable staff and a great, laid-back atmosphere. Very affordable pricing plus a great interior and exterior space. I plan on becoming a regular here - you seriously need to try it.
3445	1	a	So I went to check this place out and was surprised as it is located inside of the am/pm at the corner of Craig and Rancho. The location could be a lot better but the burger and fries more than make up for it! The fries taste great, They are light and crispy with a good salt ratio. The burgers are very simple (patty, grilled onions, cheese, and a pickle) Although very simple they are great! They have a white castle vibe and when they are hot they are down right addicting! I see these guys coming up in the future, They could add some different cheese options (pepperjack, swiss, maybe?) Just to set themselves apart from white castle. That is going to be a big thing as I really do think they have a white castle thing going on at least with their burgers for that matter (not a bad thing) Either way I have to say that I will be back and will enjoy these quicker burgers as they are fun to eat and where else can you get a piece of birthday cake with your burger?
3446	0	a	An absolute waste of a drive from southeast side of town to this pretender of White Castle!!  I just wanted to try a few first and then order more for the rest of us in the car after. I ordered two cheeseburger for $1.92. Cold and flavorless. They were not cooked within the last hour for sure. A young kid was in the walk up area sitting in a tall bar stool with his back towards me as I approached and him having a discussion with someone behind the wall.I literally was handed my burgers in less than 15 seconds!!! then the kid sat back down to finish his conversation. Please buy a frozen pack of White Castle from the market until they actually open at the Casino Royale in another 2 Months!!
3447	1	a	This was my first Quickee Burger . Didn't know what to expect. Had of course heard about these magical burgers\n\nStaff was friendly and the place was clean.  Food. Didn't expect much. Boy was I surprised. Their sliders are packed w flavor. Finished four cheese burgers in two minutes. I'm definitely coming back.
3448	0	a	I was looking forward to trying an old concept brought back. Today Saturday the 11th I had the chance. I was very disappointed! Very difficult to park, no drive-thru, no place to sit. I did manage to order but the wait time was over the top. This type of burger is meant to be served very fast, indeed, it's size alone mandates a fast prep time! Fries were no hot and not crisp, soggy and had a spice to them. I ordered a vanilla milk shake which had an off (cheap) flavor, pumped full of air (over-run) and was so thick it could not be drunk thru a straw. The wait for the order was so long I asked for someone in charge and spoke with a heavy-set gentleman who seemed to be one of the principals. He was not very receptive to my comments even choosing to argue several points rather than thank me for taking the time to point out the problems and short comings of a new business. Management or owners should never choose to escalate a complaint to an argument. I'm really doing you a favor by taking the time to complain (I want you to succeed!)Every customer or guest should be so good to you!!!
3449	0	a	Okay yes. I am spoiled by White Castle cause I'm originally from Chicago. I did however, keep an open mind when visiting this place and I drove all the way from Henderson for the experience.\n\nNo matter how I tried, I could'nt come up with a reason to come back to this establishment.\n\nThe location is dismal ( in a really dirty gas station ) , no parking, nor drive thru and no indoor seating.\n\nUpon arriving I placed my order and was not given drink cups, and had to get directions on how to get a drink cup from another customer.  Food comes in nondescript white and brown paper bags. No logo or anything to indicated where this food is from on any packaging. This should'nt matter though if it is good.\n\nIt was mildly remeniscient of sliders from White Castle but we had one customer in front of us and two behind and still had to wait ten minutes for our food.  This made me think that at least it would be fresh. NOPE!  Stone cold and dry!\n\nAnyway, so come to find out that there was a man standing about four feet from me the whole time.  I thought he was either a loiterer or just an obnoxious patron dressed like a street person.  Come to find out he is the owner and he made it his focus to offend all seven people in the place before they left.  WOW!\n\nIf you want to be disrespected and sold low standard food go there. Otherwise, wait for the real deal in the future when White Castle opens on the strip.\n\nI really wanted this to be a good experience cause I love sliders, but... Oh well!
3450	0	a	"I didn't have the food - I couldn't get past the \""server\"". The burgers must be made in advance to sit and wait as I couldn't get them without cheese. On top of that - with no other customers in the site, the \""chef\"" had over 20 burgers on the grill. If you want dried up, old food, go here. Otherwise, even burger king will make the burger when you order it."
3451	0	a	"I really really was hoping to give this place a great rating, but I am unable to. Whoever says these burgers taste like White Castle, has obviously never had a \""Real White Castle Burger'. Even though they were cooked fresh, they tasted old. The Red Velvet Birthday Cake really gives you the \""Birthday Feeling\"" as it tasted like melted wax candle. Not sure if they use a cream cheese base frosting, but it tasted kinda off. Everyone is different, and you may like it. I for one, will not be going back. Time to bust out the tums. My stomach feels like it is just about to let loose. #gross!!!"
3452	0	a	We were so excited to try their burgers so we made the 30 min drive. I was shocked to find out that they were in a dirty gas station. To play it safe I ordered one before I ordered for the whole family. Took a bite and it tasted like a microwaved burger super gross. We ended up driving to in and out totally disappointed...
3453	0	a	"I want to give this place a higher rating because of the fabulous young lady that took our order, but unfortunately the food wasn't that good.\n\nQuickee is located inside the ARCO gas station on the corner of Rancho and Craig.  Believe me....this is a prime location for some people watching...if you know what I mean!\n\nThe menu is limited to cheeseburgers, fries, can soda and a \""black and white\"", which is their version of a shake.  The cheeseburgers are small, like White Castle.  They have onions, pickles, cheese and mustard on them. \n\nFor fast food, I guess they were ok.  They don't hold a \""fry\"" to In&Out burgers for sure.  The bread got too soggy and the patty was pretty flavorless. The fries came out lukewarm and weren't anything above average in taste.\n\nThe service was great though and we were in and out within 10 minutes.   The best thing was the shake.  I would go back for one of them, if I got the hankering for a shake again.  I wouldn't return to this location after dark, however.  :/"
3454	0	a	If you plan on purchasing A groupon keep in mind that it does not work for online ordering. also you cannot make changes to any order that uses a Groupon so if you have allergies to anything that comes on the burger probably shouldn't purchase or use the Groupon. Cash only inside the store. Good luck
3455	0	a	Really not too much of a great comparison to White Castle (even the frozen ones).  I give it 2 1/2 stars, although I went opening week so maybe quality assurance is better now.\n\nWas excited to hear we had some White Castle 'competition' coming to town with Quickee Burgers.  As a note, there is no actual Quickee Burgers restaurant - to find it you will have to jaunt into the AM/PM on the corner of Craig and Rancho (home of the same strip mall where you can get great Thai food (albeit in a bar)).  Quickee Burgers is located inside in a small area.  Really only takeout, no real seating anywhere unless they add a few stools eventually.  So order, take home, or eat standing up.\n\nFound the Groupon that would feed two folks for $10, but we managed to stretch it for four.  Comes with 10 Quickee Burgers with cheese, 2 orders of fries, and 2 milkshakes (we opted for Black & White - combo of vanilla and chocolate).  We also picked up a free slice of Red Velvet birthday cake when checking in with Yelp (not sure if that's still available).  Order was in quick, but prep was really slow.  Granted it was grand opening and folks were still trying to learn how to communicate with each other.  After a 15 minute wait, our order was ready to go.\n\nHonestly really disappointed with the quality of Quickee Burgers burgers.  They are a tad larger than the ones from White Castle, but damn were they pretty flavorless.  Buns were good but on the cold side, would have helped with a warming on the grill.  Burgers?  Dry as a bone, and lacked so much flavor.  Would have been a benefit if they cooked it like White Castle does, poke holes in the burgers so the steam from the grilled onions below moisten and flavor the patty.  Easily, our patties were all overcooked and lifeless.  I'm really not sure if they even used salt & pepper on them!  Condiments were the norm - cheese was some sort of cheddar (although it was bordering on Kraft singles), some onion bits, pickle, mustard & ketchup.  But still overall the burger was dry.  I ended up adding some mayo to mine to get them back up to par.\n\nFries were OK though.  Thin, salty, but not quite cooked enough.  All got limp before we got home.  Maybe a bit more time in the oil would have made them much better.  But the taste was good.  Shakes were pretty mediocre.  Shakes were too light from having too much air in the mixing machine.  Not close to a thick shake at all, but like cheap soft serve.  Plus it was cloyingly sweet!  Really had an artificial taste to them, probably from their shake mix.  Wasn't my favorite.  Although it looked super cheesy, the Red Velvet birthday cake was actually pretty good.  It's just a plain sheet cake covered in birthday frosting, but the cake itself was moist.  \n\nWas a good effort Quickee Burgers.  But I think I will stick to waiting until White Castle actually comes to Las Vegas (soon baby, soon).  Or I will just opt to buying the frozen ones from my local warehouse store and reheat them in a pan.  Unless the quality of your burger improves by a few bounds, I'm not sure I'll be back anytime soon.  Taste, I need taste!\n\nTHE QUICK & THE DEAD.
3456	0	a	I went back to give this place another shot because I don't want to just give up on a new business after one mediocre experience. This time I ended up just leaving without buying any food because they've apparently changed their rules and can not make any modifications to the burgers. I'm not sure if the cashier was just being lazy or if that really is the norm now. Please... this is a food establishment, people have food allergies! You won't get very far if you're unwilling to make exceptions.
3457	0	a	Just terrible.  Took 2 hours to get my food by then the food was cold and stale.  Asked for a discount offered more crappy burgers.  This was the worst.
3458	0	a	Nothing to impressed, but not bad either. Just food. I think more for kids. Its 5 bucks for some small burgers & fries.
3459	1	a	Went there yesterday with couple of friends, stoped the day before but they were already closed. We all ordered  the brown bag special -4 burgers, fries and a coke-we added cheese . Everyone enjoyed them. They are white castle style burgers. better than some of the other fastfood burgers in this town. They were cooked fresh, had onion  and pickle, perfect for what they are. The shop is located  in a gas station, but so what, they have their own little area. A single burger is .69 with cheese .89.  Worth a try for a quick burger meal. My only suggestion  to them is to stay open late. They would make a great after bar food. I will be going back.
3460	1	a	Dr. Drew is wonderful! I have been seeing him for a while now due to a car accident. At first I could barely move because of the pain but after not very long he got it to be manageable and now whenever the pain flairs up I just call and he adjusts the problematic spots.
3461	1	a	I've been seeing Dr Drew for over a year now and can't imagine what shape I'd be in without his weekly adjustments.  I originally found Dr. Drew through the franchised chain he used to work at.  Call me crazy, but I don't think it's good to have more than one person work on your back, so I was always religious about going when I knew he'd be working.  \n\nI'm so glad he's at this new location where A) you don't have to worry about the nightmare parking lot of the old place B) you can make an appointment and C) he's able to use additional techniques and offer complimentary therapies (decompression, massage therapy, etc) that weren't available at the other place.\n\nDr Drew's a great doctor and I trust him 100% when it comes to my chronic back and neck pain.  He really cares about his patients and will listen to what you need each time.  He's also super affordable and flexible with payment; he'll check your insurance benefits for you, has flexible packages (no use it or lose it here!), and you can also use your FSA dollars!
3462	0	a	So I was pretty hungry once and came in this fairly new restaurant which was close to me. The cook was pretty nice, and the place was empty, sort of a grey atmosphere. I don't think one is meant to eat in this place - take-out seemed like the way to go.\n\nI wanted to check it out, so I got the Pad See Ew, for $10, which honestly, is very pricey. (literally everything is $10) The taste was decent, but the dish didn't pick up any flavor from the wok. The braised bits of beef were okay though. \n\nThe amount he gave really cheesed me though. If you pay $10, it's fair to assume you should be getting a good amount, but the bowl was half full. I understand why almost no one goes here. Thai Express is literally down the street and 2-3 bucks cheaper, a generous portion and honestly, tastes better - which is pretty sad. They claim to provide an authentic taste, but really, none of that was communicated to me through the dish, and I've been to Thailand.\n\nOverall, if you're a student or not - save your money and just go to the Thai Express if you want something vaguely resembling Pad Sew.
3463	1	a	"Outside of a few specific food items, I considered myself pretty adventurous food wise. While my parents did expose me to many different things outside of our French-Canadian customs, it wasn't until I moved downtown for school did I learn to enjoy some more \""obscure\"" (at least from my perspective) food cultures. All of this came to mind when I heard about a new restaurant in St-Henri serving up great Middle Eastern cuisine. This type of cuisine is still a huge blind spot in my food knowledge so I was very hopeful that Sumac could show me the way.\n\nLocated on the main strip of Notre Dame just west of the Atwater Market, Sumac has a very clean and sharp look. They beautifully utilize the brick wall of the old building and compliment it with pure white walls, light hardwood floors and solid wood tables. The ample lighting create a very bright space that creates a warm feel. They have a slight different ordering procedure where you order at the counter and then serve you at your table using number cards. The issue, in the two times I have been, was that because the menu is only on the wall right by the cash, people take a little too long to order as they figure what to order. As such, the lineup at the counter gets long and takes longer than it probably should. The line spills into the seating space which isn't great either for the patrons seating down. Also, there isn't really a good spot for takeout people to wait either. Note that I went on two Friday nights so probably the peak period for this problem. I imagine it is much better the rest of the time - not a big deal, simply a minor observation.\n\nThe menu is one befitting a falafel shop - falafels, chicken shawarma, beef kefta with a assortment of salads, grains, fries, hummus and baba. On my first visit, I decided to start with the hummus fries with hummus, tahini and s'rug. This dish was one of the first things I saw online from Sumac and peaked my interest tremendously. Just wonderful all around - the fries were nicely crispy on the outside and fluffy inside. The combination of the creamy tahini, the spice of the s'rug and the rich hummus worked exceptionally well - I had no knowledge of s'rug prior to this and my limited time with tahini never made me think of this combination. Great starter and a huge portion as well. A must-have for sure!\n\nGiven the size of the fries, I decided to go with a chicken shawarma pita to finish off the meal. When you order a pita at Sumac, it is grilled and filled with hummus, tahina, chopped salad, white &amp; purple cabbage and pickled turnip on top of your meal of choice. First off, the pita bread at Sumac is insanely good. Borderland obscene. Wherever they get them, I need to find out because they have put every other pita bread I've tried to shame. Thick but yet soft and chewy, the pita bread provided a great vessel for the rest of the ingredients. The chicken was nice and juicy and the vegetables fresh and crisp. An excellent pita all around.\n\nI was so enthused by my first visit that I decided to return two weeks later for a quick takeout. In this instance, I broke my own rule and didn't order the fries in order to try some more of the menu. First, I went with the garlic labneh served with bulgarian feta, dukkah, paprika oil, mint and a side of grilled pita bread. A wonderful appetizer that needed a lot more bread than I got! I loved how the labneh and feta mixed together - combining the saltiness and firmer texture of the feta with the yogourt-like creaminess and sour taste of the labneh. The nutty mixture of the dukkah with the fresh mint and spicy paprika oil helped to ease up the heavy richness of the dish. Very nice all around and made for a great snack using the leftovers.\n\nMy main course this second time was the falafel plat served with pita, hummus, tahini, pickled turnip and my choice of two salads. I went with the fried eggplant (with harissa, preserved lemon and coriander) and the Moroccan carrots with currants, cumin and parsley. Enjoyed the carrots although they weren't as spicy as I expected. As for the eggplant, it was okay - something didn't grab me and frankly I'm not sure what. As for the falafels themselves, loved them. Great crunch to the exterior but they still kept a nice moistness inside. Nice depth of flavour as well.\n\nSumac provided me with a wonderful trip into Middle Eastern cuisine which was my hope. My initial visit got me interested enough to head back to try more and my second visit did more of the same. I may lack knowledge in this cuisine but I know enough about great cuisine to know that Sumac does it very well. Some of you may be scared away simply by the type of cuisine but believe me, you would be doing yourselves a grave disservice to ignore the wonderful food coming out of this little shop in St-Henri. You should have time on your side if you change your mind - I suspect Sumac will be a staple in the neighbourhood for some time.\n\nCheers!"
3464	1	a	Great food. I went with my Co workers to try this place for lunch and the service was great!  And my spinach wrap was delicious. I loved the fries and omg!! Their fried oreos are out of this world. I'll be coming her more often.
3465	1	a	I found this place wandering around lookjng for a new chill slash eat spot and so i stoped bye and they never disapoint and also i new these gus from the swap meen good to see they got ther own place keep up the good work
3466	1	a	Amazing place! Fried p&b is my favorite! I also really loved the Blt! You can tell the food is made with top quality products! Service was great! They had REAL sweet tea ! To die for!  Honestly I I have tried more then one thing and have not been disappointed at all! I will be a retuning customer!! Tell your friends! Also there prices are just so good! You can actually great food for under 10.00!
3467	1	a	WOW don't have to go to the county fair now to get fair food I found it right here in my own neighborhood. Had the deep-fried Nutella sandwich unbelievably good. Sampled the funnel cake also tasty but those Oreos were a slice of deep-fried heaven. Prices were reasonable. Will be back.
3468	1	a	The Big Tony was delicious!!! Btw the fried pickles are a must. I'm excited to come back and try something different.
3469	1	a	This food was delicious ... Never tried food like this before and great service.\n- deep fried Oreo\n- best wings\n- fries\n\nThis my third time this week eating here and you will see plenty of me again. \n\nHighly recommended!!
3470	1	a	"If you like \""Fair Food\"" as in \""food from the county fair\"" (and not \""average\""), well, this is the place for you. \n\nImpossibly light fried pickles! Frito Pies! Chicken Wings!\n\nFried things like Oreos and Peanut Butter and Jelly sandwiches! This stuff is great. It's horrible for you, but it's so well done.\n\nFor me, the true star of the show was the Chicken Fried Steak Sandwich. Look at the photos, this is exactly how it tastes. Anyone who's ever eaten from a Drive In diner in the midwest with some misspelled form of \""Dairy\"" or \""Freeze\"" or an exceedingly close to copyright infringement of Dairy Queen in the name of the joint knows EXACTLY of what I speak. This thing is awesome and messy and perfect.\n\n...now if he only had pork tenderloin sandwiches!"
3471	1	a	"Duzan , Henderson's newest Mediterranean restaurant right next to Crepe Shack.\n\nI came across this place while pigging out on some crepes next door, the following day I decided to give it a whirl since I noticed there has not been any yelp postings. \n\nThe unique thing about this place was their meats were \"" HALAL\"" or should we say kosher ( Blessed meet) and they also offered  Mediterranean tapas, which was rare for a Mediterranean place to have, from what I have experienced.\n\nFor all you Vegans and Vegetarians they have a pretty good selection. I did the Tapas buy 5 get 1 free the tapas were about $2.79 each. \n\nBeing 80% veggies I ordered the Tabbouleh salad ( vegan), Fattoush salad ( vegan), Taziki Sauce, Hummus ( you can choose the flavor you want i chose garlic), Grape leaves ( vegetarian), and I ordered the lamb shawarma.\n\nEverything I ordered was delicious and was very flavorful, I really loved the grape leaves and the tabbouleh salad. The lamb shawarma was okay the meat was a bit dry but still okay. They bake everything fresh at the place, their Baklavas were to die for, It was not to sweet it was perfect! They also offered other middle eastern pastries and breads. Their menu options was great I will definitely go back to try their meat platters next time. \n\nOverall, I had an awesome experience at this place and I look forward to going back!"
3472	1	a	My mom and I stumbled upon this new restaurant today.  I always love trying Mediterranean places.  We had the Chicken Schnitzel, veggie combo dish and kibbeh balls.  We also had their baklavah.  Baklavah was awesome, their hummus was great too.  Will go back so I can try a few other dishes there.  The manager/owner Ab was real nice and receptive and helpful.
3473	1	a	I came here a few nights ago in search to try out my first Mediterranean restaurant and was glad I did my research.  Duzan had opened just a few days earlier and  Amer, was extremely friendly.  They were scheduled to close at 8pm but stayed open for us to enjoy the quality food and time.  Some people even walked in after we left and they stayed open for them. \n\nService: 10\n\nThey treat everyone equally and let each person take their time. \n\nFood: 9\n\nOnly reason it's not a 10 is because I don't know what to compare it to but I'll definitely be back to Duzan.  I'd like I try out their original location, Amena Cafe & Bakery.\n\n\nI'm getting hungry... Thank you Amer!
3474	1	a	So delete any other Mediterranean book marks off your list in this area, this is the only one you need.  As others said this is connected to the amena restaurant on obannan, which I was always sad was so far away.  Now I can stop in here for yummy food before my weekly trip to trader Jo's since its on the same parking lot.  I got the veggie combo plate and I have to say the falafal was executed even better at this location. The best falafel of my life.  Crunchy on the outside, not to dense , moist on the inside, not to greasy, and flavorful.  The babganoush is lovely and fresh and Smokey, dolmas have a really rich satisfying flavor.  I always love getting the lemonade with mint.  They blend in the mint and ice and it's nice and frothy, not to sweet , super refreshing.  My boyfriend got a combo and they were so wonderful and replaced the falafel out so he could try all the meat types since he's such a carnivore lol all very moist shwarma meats and flavorful.  He even ate all of his salad which never happens.  They bake the pita bread fresh so it's always delish, and they also have a case of food to go of many of their items.  The desserts are to die for, just the right balance.  To often lately I have been given baklavas that have been so dry and lacking in soul, these are perfection, along with one dessert filled with a firm cheese, and another that looks like it has crispy noodly phillo dough.  In addition the owners and workers just like at the amen location, are wonderful people. Such great service, and food from the heart. You must support this local business!
3475	1	a	I made a Yelp account just for this restaurant.\n\nMy parents and I came in Friday night for dinner. \n\nThe owner was very friendly and helpful with the menu.\n\nI ordered the falafel plate. The falafels were really light and the salad also had a light dressing. Very yummy!\n\nMy mom got the special which was a stuffed bell pepper. She basically licked the plate clean! \n\nMy dad got the shish tauok. I will be ordering this the next time! The chicken was moist and flavorful. So good.\n\nAside from the entrees, we ordered kibbehs, tabbouleh and hummus. The owner gave us some spicy pickles, olives, hot sauce and let us sample the lentils and rice. I need more of that in my life, LoL.\n\nOverall, we had a great dinner and will be back soon!
3476	1	a	This restaurant is so customer-oriented..I'm amazed with the service and the warm welcome of Ab & Amir. I ordered the Shish Taouk (skewer chicken) and it was very delicious. Make sure to order the grape leaves warm, they're divine! All the different dishes, sides, and even the drinks are freshly made. Definitely give their fresh lemonade with mint a try, it won't disappoint. Ab was very kind and gave us complimentary hot tea and a taste of their baklava. Overall, very, very pleased with everything from this restaurant, I will be coming back for sure!
3477	1	a	Yum! They have a lot of vegan and vegetarian options. The staff are very helpful and the service is great. Loved their falafel and lentil soup. I'll definitely be back!
3478	1	a	Food was outstanding and the staff was very friendly. Homemade pita bread and a Mediterranean style lemonade made for a delicious lunch.
3479	0	a	I did not care for this place at all not because of the atmosphere which was good, but the food was terrible and over complicated.  I ordered the gyro and instead of putting even a light portion of meat on it they literally took every kind of vegetable, herb, pickel you name it and threw it in a pita. I left with confused taste buds and paid a higher price than most other Mediterranean grills in the area.
3480	1	a	Everything I had was good, but what makes this place a 5 star was the owner. He was very nice and gave us a small sample of soup and dessert to try since it was our first time. I love family run joints like this, especially when the owner is highly involved in daily operations. I plan to return.
3481	1	a	"This little gem opened up a few month ago and it is run by the same people that have owned the Amena Cafe on Sahara near O'Bannon St. We started with the hummus \""tapas\"" (their tapas are not the Spanish variety of small servings of various culinary concoctions but dippings for pita bread which can be ordered as whole wheat or regular). The pita was nice and warm and the hummus rich and flavorful. The Open Face Eggplant was huge mound of food with many different tastes and could have used a touch more tahini (on the side would have been better) but was freshly made and very good. There was more than enough for two meals. I had never had Shawarma before so I order the chicken and beef in the Combo Special. The chicken was spicy and the \""Halal\"" beef was tender and spiced perfectly. The only thing one might want to know is that if you are not into spicy foods tell the staff and the chef will back off on the spices. This is important if you have children or people who don't normally eat spicy foods.  If this is not a concern then have at their offers freely.  The dessert was magnificent...an order of Bakalava was heavenly and the Kunaffe with goat cheese was out-of-this world!!  We had more than enough to take home for another meal.  The decor needs work to give this place a more intimate atmosphere as it was a pizza joint for many years but don't let that stop you from going in. The chairs are not the standard plastic or wood bottoms and it wouldn't take much to get this place a little more elegant. In the meantime go and see Amer and get a taste sensation fix...tell him Nick sent you!"
3482	1	a	Wow! This restaurant is absolutely incredible! I came in on a Thursday night and it wasn't super packed, Senator Harry Reid had just came in with his wife to eat. One of the owners was so amazing and I had some of the best service. I split the Combo Special and the food was so good, but did have a lot of food. We got complimentary drinks and dessert on the house and THE PITA BREAD WAS UNBELIEVABLE! It's house made and cannot be missed. Definitely coming back for more!!!
3483	0	a	Very disappointed , found hair in my burger .. There boneless wings was nasty , the sauce was so thick and caked on like frosting ....  I would never return back . I wouldn't give any stars but I had no choice too .
3484	0	a	I came into this place at 1pm and there was one man sitting waiting for his food. I ordered a California Burger and an order of zucchini. I sat down and waited for my to go order.  Six other people came in after me and received their food BEFORE me.  I finally at 1:20pm got up and asked about my food taking so long and the lady at the counter (who lacks customer service skills) told me that my food took so long because of what I got.  I saw people get chicken wings, hamburgers, etc while I was waiting.   I think that was just an excuse because maybe they forgot my order?\n\nFinally got back to work with my food and my zucchini was burned and gross. I have a feeling that the person who left them a good comment....works there because this place is terrible.  Food isn't good, customer service needs lots of work.  I won't be back.
3485	0	a	Can I give less than 1 star?\nThe worst service you can possibly imagine from the bar staff. \nPoor ventilation and an all around miserable time. \nThe few people, an I mean few, who actually seem to care about there jobs are highly overshadowed by the majority of people working there that play a favorite or two and let you wait 30 minutes for a drink!\nStay away if you actually want to have a drink.
3486	0	a	"This place is terrible! Extremely poor service. Poor ventilation. Dirty tables everywhere! Obviously understaffed and the bartender was the worst I've ever had. She couldn't make a Manhattan and told my Irish father-in-law that the Guiness was \""from Las Vegas.\"" It took forever to get our food, which was not up to PT's standards. Kavanaugh's went downhill towards the end, but even at its worst, it was way better than Sean Patrick's! I paid $8 for a cup of watery potato soup...and the potatoes were still crunchy. A drunk foul-mouthed woman also made the experience miserable. This place needs some serious help if they want to stay in business. I know they won't be seeing us again!"
3487	0	a	What bartender tells a paying customer what he/she should and shouldn't drink without me asking. Then when I order a drink and he doesn't approve it. he won't get it for you and let you set there.
3488	0	a	"First time here since becoming Sean Patrick's. An \""Irish\"" bar playing country music. Don't expect to get served quickly unless you're at the bar gambling. Won't be back."
3489	1	a	Ever since the place changed to Sean Patricks we have had nothing but great experiences. The foods great especially the wings, Jessica and the other bartenders are attentive and quick. Love coming here.
3490	0	a	"Stopped in to watch some football. It was so cold it was terribly uncomfortable to sit there. We ordered food so no choice but to wait for it. The fry bucket was ok (how can you mess up fries). The quesadilla was super bland. The guacamole was horrible.  The worst part was their gambling criteria. Me and my husband both put in $20. Then I put in an additional $20. Only 1 comped beer ..., WHAT!?? Really ?!?!?  I will NEVER gamble there again. What the hell is \""handle\""?"
3491	1	a	I ate here for the first time last week with a gift certificate I won from the radio. I found out that it used to be Kavanaugh's, but it is now part of the same chain as PT's and Sierra Gold. The menu was pretty similar if not identical to that of PT's and Sierra Gold.\n\nI had the buffalo medium chicken wings, and I'd have to give it 2 thumbs up! The wings were super tasty and juicy! They were not dripping with sauce and instead were a little crispy which I absolutely LOVED. I was craving the wings days later and went to PT's and ordered it, thinking it was the same - and it was not! I will definitely go back to Sean Patrick's again just for the wings!
3492	0	a	Food horrid, service was ok.\n\nEven though it was comped from my play at PT's I wouldn't eat here again.\n\nI was told that they make everything, yeah right out of a can it was horrible and for 9.00 you can get something out of a can for $0.50 that would taste better at Smith's just down the street.\n\nOh well lesson learned.
3493	0	a	"New store,laid out very nice,friendly people.But like they say one bad apple.My bad apple was Blake (customer service ctr)who went out of his way to be a jerk!! My disabled son and I had just spent 150.00 and were heading to the car when my son remembered he was out of cigarettes,so I told him to go back and get them while I load the groceries.Well even though he is 35 he had forgot his ID and BLAKE wouldn't sell them to him.So I go back inside to get them and explained to BLAKE that Mike was 35 and to please give me the cigs as I am 60 and have my ID.BLAKE refused saying \""now that I know you are buying for him I won't sell to you\"".So I had him call a Mgr over who told BLAKE to sell me the cigs and BLAKE still refused.This was insane and senseless and ruined my experence.I explained to BLAKE that he was just being an ass but he seemed to disagree.So my advise is if you go to the Customer Service Ctr avoid BLAKE as he is an egotistical jerk."
3494	0	a	3 baggers congregating around check out, only one bagging. Talking  amongst themselves about the lack of cashiers. Ignoring us completely till it was time to pay. Manager stood close by and said nothing.
3495	1	a	It's about time the west side finally got a restaurant worth going to for breakfast, lunch and dinner. Great staff, great food, great bar.  This place has a bright future for sure!!!!
3496	0	a	I get that the restaurant is new, but I walked in at 7:28 AM for breakfast. Saw several customers seated and waiting for a server or food or something. Waited to be seated. Waited. Got a couple smiles from seated customers who were sharing my experience. Waited a bit more. Not an employee in sight. Walked out at 7:38.\n\nI'll probably give them another chance. But not this week.
3497	1	a	I have eaten here 4 times--2 lunches, 1 dinner and 1 breakfast.  I have had the pulled pork (excellent flavor), the AZ burger (wonderful with a touch of spice from the green chilis), the pork shanks  with marmalade sauce (out of this world) and huevos benedictos with chorizo and chipotile cream sauce (excellent with a nice back bite of spice).  The service has been great everytime.  I am so glad this place opened in Goodyear.
3498	0	a	Good food and good happy hour menu and prices.  If you are a party of 5 or more you are gonna wait a very long time to be seated.  We also waited a long time for our food.
3499	1	a	Had a great time last Thursday!  Very nice service & manager made a point of coming over and checking in. Great food - the ribs were wonderful!  Thank you.
3500	0	a	My Mom and I stopped in for lunch last week, maybe Tuesday or Wednesday, at a little before noon. We were seated right away, the restaurant wasn't busy.  Iced teas were served in average time.  I ordered the TAB (turkey, avocado, bacon) sandwich with sweet potato fries.  My Mom wanted to order the half sandwich/salad option.  She wanted the same TAB sandwich and one of their salad items, a strawberry something salad.  She was told that the only salad options were a garden or ceasar salad, so she opted for a garden salad.  It took easily 30 mins for the order to arrive.  \n\nIn the meantime, the restaurant started to fill and it became obvious there were only two servers working the entire south side of the restaurant.  The order arrived and my mother's order was wrong.  She was given a full sandwich with a side salad which, once we got the bill, we realized the waitress got wrong and did a salad substitution instead of the other sandwich side options which added almost $2 to the bill.  Given that the waitress pointed out the half sandwich options, not sure why the order wasn't correct.  She was completely unavailable to straighten it out.  For a sandwich that is named with avocado sharing the spotlight with turkey and bacon, it isn't unthinkable to expect a few actual slices of avocado in there.  Both sandwiches had so little avocado, I had to take a pic and include it with the review.  The bread was average whole wheat bread.  A better quality of bread could have really upped that game.  One highlight was the battered sweet potato fries.  \n\n Would I try this restaurant again?  Probably not.  We're lunch diners and with Wildflower Bread Co down the street, their food is so much better.
3501	1	a	My son and I go to Goodyear for his travel baseball team and play at the Red's Complex.  I know the Haymaker from Peoria and love it so I wanted to stop at Goodyear.  The food is very good and the staff is very friendly.   So much better than your typical chain.   This is also a great place to watch a sporting event.
3502	1	a	Really delicious. Good tasted great and service was great as well. Decor is also really cute. Would definitely recommend.
3503	1	a	Tried this place on a Sunday afternoon for lunch. The staff was very friendly. The place was pretty full but not so full that we had to wait for a table. Order the pulled pork sandwich and it was great. Food came out quick and the prices are the same as a comparable place. Will be returning.
3504	1	a	We've been here many times since they opened. Every time has been a good experience. We really like the atmosphere and the food is excellent. We have our favorites, but we like to try everything on the menu. We have had several servers and they treat us very well. The Manager is a bit full of himself. He knows we are regulars, but never gives us the attention he does the other people that have been there several times. That kind of bothers us, but now we just ignore him and enjoy our time there. We don't come to see him anyways! We come for the food! We like the happy hour much better then Applebees. Much better crowd of people and better food. \n\nOne thing that makes us laugh is the amount of people that can't get over the fact that it is no longer Caballero Grill. I hear people asking if they can use their gift cards there. It's not the same restaurant or people! It's a much better restaurant, much better service, and better place all around.
3505	1	a	This is our 2nd trip to The Haymaker since they opened this location. I've had burgers both times and have been very happy both times. My wife had the teriyaki steak bowl the first time and a burger the second time. She said both were very good. They have several specials through the week and they appear to be winners. The place is packed tonight. The atmosphere is a mix between sit down and sports bar. There are ample TV's for you to watch a game. The wait staff and hostess are very pleasant and helpful. This a place you should try. I'm sure we will be back to try other things on the menu.
3506	0	a	"The food was edible and could have been a lot better. Typical bowling alley French fries and a bland dry tasteless \""cardiologist\"" burger. Has potential but there is nothing special. My main gripe with this place is the beer situation. Anytime I go somewhere and they actually have good craft beer in excited. This place has good beer. But no one there knows anything about it. There is no rotating tap list so you have to be in the bar or walk over there to see what's on tap, the server had no idea. Also you can't serve every beer in a mason jar.  I get that it goes with the theme but it's dumb."
3507	1	a	This place is real cool. I hardly go out to eat but I stopped by after work one day since I work close by and was surprised. Good prices good food and the people that work there are all really nice ( yes even the feisty Kelsey). Quick refills and food brought out fast even when busy. The fish tacos are amazing, western burger is great. Great place to get some food, few drinks and watch the game. I will go back for sure.
3508	0	a	Not great. Pretty bland. Food was cold. Hardly anyone here. I'd probably give it another try, but the prices were a bit high for so little flavor.
3509	0	a	"Marginal to say the least!! Been to other Haymakers and was very satisfied. This on the other hand left me wanting for service and my food. This may be a new restaurant but when I opened restaurants, the employees didn't make false excuses for food not coming with the rest of the party. We admitted a mistake and tried to make my customer happy. Everyone was mostly through the meal when I received mine,when the waiter said \"" It takes a long time to make these\"". REALLY? Fish Tacos! Give me a break. I could have flown to Missouri, caught the Catfish and flown back while waiting. I won't be back."
3510	1	a	Great restaurant! Good food, comfortable atmosphere and great beer on tap! Jill is the best bartender! She makes it worth the trip!
3511	1	a	"Had the Arizona burger with grilled chicken. Definitely worth the $10 with the Cajun fries. My wife has a salad that seemed a bit \""lacking\"", but the rest of the party had burgers and they were solid. Beer selection was really good and they had plenty of TVs for college football. Definitely an upgrade over the previous proprietor. Oh, fried pickles were really good as well."
3512	1	a	Nice atmosphere,  good service.  Fabulous buffalo chicken sandwich on Texas toast!  Hubby loved the fish and chips.
3513	1	a	"Yep, I'm giving this place 5 Stars. I recently moved back to AZ, and this restaurant is near the office. Based on the Yelp reviews and it being within walking distance (if I wanted to walk) I drove over there to check it out.\n\nRight away, I liked the feel. I mean, it was welcoming and stylish while still being simple and \""country,\"" you know what I mean? I don't like fancy-shmancy places unless I'm out with my wife for some special occasion or something. Not for lunch, not by myself. But I'm not a fan of dives either. Haymaker's is just right. \n\nThe service was spot-on. I never had to wait to order a drink or my food, or for a refill, at the same time she didn't come around bugging me every 2 minutes to ask how my food was while I had a mouthful of it.\n\nI had a burger and \""frings,\"" because I felt like some onion rings but not too much... perfect balance in my opinion. The burger was great, cooked to order and delicious. \n\nThe prices aren't bad. I will make this part of my regular cycle of lunch stops, and one of these evenings I'll take my wife for dinner and see how that goes."
3514	1	a	I knew I was going to love it when I saw the blessing we used to say growing up in reclaimed wood on the wall, larger than life.  The waiter (from Louisiana) was awesome and our food was delicious.  We will be back and are so happy to welcome The Haymaker to the neighborhood!
3515	0	a	Food not great, took forever to get food then it came out cold. Service is below average and then the waitress messed up on our tabs and it took over 30 mins to get it sorted out. Not a place to right home about!
3516	1	a	Could not get into the Black Bear diner so we started looking around for a place to have breakfast before we started a trip.  Came across this place and it was not crowded, although the food is good enough for it to be crowded.  Have the breakfast sandwich. It was great.   The country potatoes are not that could, so stick with the hash browns.   Nice spot.  Will come again.
3517	1	a	My mom, my daughter, and I visited for lunch today, and we thoroughly enjoyed ourselves.  Alan, our waiter, was very attentive and helpful, customizing my daughter's grilled cheese so that it was to her liking.  My mom enjoyed her B.L.A.T, which includes avocado and a deep fried tomato, and I enjoyed my French Dip sandwich.  The food is a bit more pricey than I like to pay for lunch, but the service was great and it was near where we were shopping.  I would definitely return another time, maybe this time for dinner with my husband.
3518	1	a	What are you waiting for? More shops to open?\nSoon enough. At least 2 are open-  Macy's & Old Navy. New Macy's is nice and employees were helpful.  The decor of the  mall is impressive, love the colorful light displays. Signage is prevalent and who doesn't like a brand spanking new shopping center.\nA great start to a long anticipated shopping/dining hub for Summerlin & those of us who really like non ghetto malls!\nDon't procrastinate too long, Downtown Summerlin is open for business.
3519	1	a	I'd been hearing lots of things about downtown summerlin and I spend a decent amount of time in summerlin so checking this out was a no brainer. I was absolutely shocked at how big this place was. According to the guide I was reading, this place is 105 acres \nIt's very similar to town square in that it's an outdoor mall and the layout except it's more like an upgraded version. There's regular stores and restaurants and high end places and it also has a personal favorite of mine: Nordstrom Rack. It's still new so everything is still shiny but the aesthetics are wonderful. The feel is very Orange County Laidback and I can definitely see this becoming the new hot spot for locals who don't want to drive all the way to the strip area to enjoy the perks of the strip.
3520	1	a	"Don't count on your GPS to find this place. Just know that it's on 215 and Sahara by Red Rock Casino. They just opened so many restaurants and stores are still \""coming soon\"". They have festivals and all sorts of festivities due to being newly-opened. It looks very promising. \n\nFood trucks on Eat Street, Lululemon, Dillard's, Macy's, House of Hoops, Michael Kors, Sephora, Sports Authority, Trader Joe's, True Religion, Forever 21, Foot Locker, Victoria's Secret, Sur La Table, Teavana are some of the stores that are open. Crave, Crazy Pita, Capriotti's and Sushi Loca as well as sold fast food places are open if you get hungry.\n\nThere seems to be ample parking, however, there are traffic directors and stop signs on top of senior drivers, bikers and pedestrians that made my drive out of this place a nightmare.  I'll come back when more stores and restaurants open."
3521	0	a	Why have a grand opening when 1/2 the stores and most restaurants aren't open? This long, anticipated event was a little disappointing, sure I knew it was another outdoor mall smack in the middle of the desert, but I was just sad that the same old mall shops, nothing new to make me want to brave the heat next July.  I think I am spoiled from too many years of living in CA, Vegas shopping just stinks, Downtown Summerlin is nothing new. Will keep my shopping trips in CA.
3522	1	a	Waited so long for this! It did not disappoint! I love the layout.. And that it is an outdoor mall. Dillard's and Macy's were beautiful!! So many different stores and more to come! I love the new Trader Joes store! Apple will be coming there along with Nordstrom Rack.. There's Old Navy, Sports Authority, a Regal 5 Luxury movie theatre!!! And so much more! I didn't shop so much.. Just soaked up the atmosphere. Great Job Summerlin!!
3523	0	a	Very Bland! There is nothing outside of Trader Joe's that I would go back for. All the anticipation Epic Fail! I was hoping this place were nicer on the grounds Town square has you beat as far as astetics.
3524	0	a	"Like Eric, nothing besides Trader Joe's will see me there. For everything else, I'll stick with Tivoli, Town Square and Fashion Show Mall. DS is just a concrete industrial zone. No way anyone will walk from one end to the other like we do in Town Square... not at all the \""village\"" feel and look I was expecting. You will need your car each time you want to go from one end to the other.... yes their shuttle is also like taking your car + plus the wait."
3525	0	a	I know my viewpoint is unpopular, but this place just missed the mark. I'm having a hard time understanding why people are raving about it.\n\nAs others have noted, it's poorly laid out, unattractive, and VERY difficult to access. Maybe it's because I'm from California that these things stand out. I notice many of the other similar reviewers are from California. But why make the place so hard to get to? From the entrances to the roads to the place itself, it's not an easy navigation. Maybe other people are OK with spending lots of time on trying to navigate a mall, but that's just not a priority for me I guess.\n\nIt will be interesting to see over the long term if parking is adequate. And that brings up another Californian point. In our state, a facility such as this cannot be built unless it proves it has adequate parking and access!\n\nAnyway, the shops are the same ole, same ole. Nothing exciting here. If you like the loud music and fashion thing, it could be fun for you. But keep in mind that many of the shops and restaurants advertised for this location are not open yet. Some aren't even built. Also, keep in mind that Downtown Summerlin is not trying to attract a high end customer. I assumed they would, given the location. My first indication that assumption was incorrect should have been that Nordstrom chose to build a Rack rather than a full store in Downtown Summerlin.\n\nThe one bright spot is Trader Joe's. As long as the Sahara entrance, which is closest to the store, becomes regularly accessible, it should be an easy in and out for my favorite grocery chain. I'm very excited to have another Trader Joe's on the Summerlin side of Vegas!\n\nMaybe this desert concrete jungle will improve over time as landscape grows in and other stores open. Who knows. But it's not likely to ever score high on my list just because of its feel and energy - which is partly a result of the layout and design. For now, I'll stick with classy Tivoli Village.
3526	1	a	Downtown Summerlin is an exceptionally cool place to walk around, shop and eat at. Not everything was open yet when we checked it out on a warm Sunday afternoon, but you could already feel just how cool it is there. Definitely worth checking out.
3527	0	a	This mall was incredibly disappointing. The Macy's store is not nearly as nice as the one at Fashion Show or even the one at Meadows Mall. The Dillard's had clothing that was old and boring (BTW, I am 57 years old) and the general layout of this place sucks. I predict this place will be a ghost town within 6 months.
3528	0	a	I had high hopes for DTS especially given the interesting offerings available in Tivoli when it opened.  My hopes diminished as I looked at the names of the restaurants and stores which were going to open on the property but I held out until I could actually visit.  I have since been their twice and am comfortable enough to say that DTS is simultaneously a great disappointment for me but a need filler for Summerlin.\n\nWhy is it a need filler?  Prior to opening, the nearest place to visit the stores such as Macy's, Dillards, Old Navy, Sephora, etc was Meadows Mall and Fashion Show.  Now, local Summerlin residents can have a convenient location to shop.\n\nThats where the good ends.  From the moment I entered off of Sahara and drove through the winding passage to get to parking I noted both the lack of signage and the minimal exit pathways making it a nightmare during crowded hours to get in and out safely and quickly.  Granted, after a few more weeks the crowd will be smaller but still, it stinks of bad planning.\n\nNext, there was absolutely no way to know where anything is from the Parking area with the exception of Dillards.  In fact, had I not read up on the place, I would never of known it was anything more than a strip mall with Dillards as the centerpiece.  \n\nWhen you finally do wend your way around to the outdoor mall it is notable that the main section of the mall is utterly boring and devoid of interesting decor.  There is a section near Crave which is by a water feature that seems entirely out of place but does make for a nice place to relax.  \n\nThe restaurants and stores which are open are entirely generic, wolfgang puck's has an unimaginative menu, CPK and Capriottis are available all over town, CRAVE has potential and I will try it soon but beyond that it has nothing to distinguish itself from any other mall.\n\nThe REGAL theaters have the reclining seats but there are only 5 theaters so finding the show you want will be hit or miss.\n\nThere are several other establishments set to open in the next few months and entertainment oriented ROC Resto and Fashion could make things interesting.  I will definitely update the review then.
3529	0	a	"Sure I can write a review now or I can write a review later. Ah I'll just write an update later. Ok so its been open close to a month now and a good number of businesses aren't even open.  All you see is nothing but \""coming soon\"" signs with a lot of the businesses no where near of opening. Why even open up!? I don't even know. Anyways to keep track of what businesses are open and not here's their directory. Hopefully they keep it up to date http://downtownsummerlin.com/directory\n\nAlong the NE part of this shopping center, YES a shopping center not an actual \""Downtown\"", there's what they call the \""Dining Arroyo\"" which has a nice water feature and spacious area to sit and relax from all the shopping and walking around. There's a few restaurants in that area like MTO Cafe, Wolfgang Puck Bar and Grill, California Pizza, and Crave. Here's a couple of pics from the Dining Arroyo I'm facing west, notice how they fail to utilize the beautiful view of Red Rock Canyon and the mountains around. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/downtown-summerlin-las-vegas?select=a9d15FZhhi3tlpP4inH82g#a9d15FZhhi3tlpP4inH82g http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/downtown-summerlin-las-vegas?select=a9d15FZhhi3tlpP4inH82g#slSZgd8v5pEPy7WeCmvtRA All I can say is I hope Lazy Dog Restaurant and Bar, which is the NW most business not yet ready, considers having some outdoor patio with this view in the plans.\n\nAs it goes for parking, you have options, there's a couple parking garages, parking along the streets right in front of various businesses, parking lots all around, and a couple vallet areas. There's also the option of walking from the casino which isn't a short walk as I hoped. If you've been to Green Valley Ranch or the District in Henderson it not that where you can just walk a few yards and you're there.\n\nIt's a shopping center what else can I say about it. It has restaurants, clothing stores a movies theater. It's like they took some of the good features about the other shopping centers around the valley and tried to put it into one. Well there's a Nordstrom rack, Trader Joe's, Five Guys Burgers, Sur La Table, Regal, and Victoria's Secret so it's not a total bust.\n\nOf course I was very excited when I heard about the plans for Downtown Summerlin but as of right now I don't know, I guess I just have to wait until they're really truly  open for my business, in a few months. It has potential.\n\nAnd as I think I mentioned in my tip. Enter and exit from the northern streets near Charleston, seemed like most people were using Sahara."
3530	0	a	"All these years I've been waiting for a Mall of America and this crap is what we get? Went on opening weekend then again last week. It's still too crowded for an ANOTHER outdoor mall. Just a few blocks from home to shop at Trader Joe's is a plus. Nordstrom Rack was outrageously expensive and crowded so I didn't purchase anything. Old Navy had some OK deals. I don't know anybody that shops at Dillard's or Macy's anymore but Grandma's or those conned into getting their store cards. \n\nI would like to visit the Wolfgang Puck restaurant but it wasn't open yet either time I was there. I was excited and had high hopes for this \""Mall\"" but it's meh at best. \n\nI don't envision it being this busy next summer, I won't brave the heat for any of these stores. I'll go to Meadows or Fashion Show Malls instead. I love not having to drive more than a mile to shop but wish they had chosen better stores. Sur La Table is a plus and good alternative to Williams-Sonoma across from Boca Park. Rumored Apple store will be more convenient. \n\nIt's just okay. I hope it gets better. I'll update later when they open everything."
3531	0	a	They didn't have an option for forever 21 but I have to say the manager is very rough around the edges no customer service and has no business working in Summerlin she should be on the eastside of town.  I went in today Nov 16th to do an exchange for a dress I ordered online but I couldn't find anything I liked. I let them know that it was online ordering and she yelled at me for no reason saying TAKE IT BACK AND MAIL IT OFF YOURSELF OR GET A GIFT CARD. I couldn't believe she did that in front of everyone to show she's boss. I came in the store in a great mood until tha b%\u00d7\u00f7= chimed in the conversation i had with an employee not even arguing. I will never come back to that classy looking place with trashy fowl mouth managers at forever 21
3532	0	a	Stay away from the Victoria secret here! The people working there are supper rude, I waited in line for 20 min to be informed that there was only one line and I had to wait more. The woman who informed me of this was looking right at me and even made eye contact several times in the 20 min I was standing there but failed to mention that I was in the wrong line. I asked her why she didn't say something sooner and she said she wasn't lying attention.... Unacceptable!!! Wake up lady!
3533	0	a	Really this is just another up its own pooper Summerlin installment.  Mostly boring stores and no food to eat that isn't foo foo or a ripoff.  The one big plus was the new regal, but even then the movie selection was artsy and poor. I will return for the theater, but not for the mall. The whole thing seems catered to the elderly.
3534	0	a	The last few times I have came to forever 21 in down town Summerlin , I have been disappointed each and every time . The size options are basically all smalls and some mediums and never any larges. It makes my quick shopping so difficult . I live not even 5 min away from down town Summerlin & I don't see why I have to travel 15 -20'min to the next nearest mall for one or two things just because the downtown Summerlin forever 21 doesn't order in enough bigger sizes . So if your a large in clothes I don't recommend coming to this location !!!!!!!!
3535	0	a	I wasn't impressed. All the hype was really for nothing. It reminded me of Town Square. Nothing special. We walked the entire mall in less than 30 minutes. The stores are small, everything is so crammed together. I rather stick to Fashion Show.
3536	1	a	"This is really more of a 3 1/2 star review but since we can't do halves...\n\nDowntown Summerlin is the repurposed evolution of the abandoned construction carcass that was The Shops at Summerlin Centre. I must say, it is a nice addition. Seeing that the only real mall in the western portion of Vegas was the Meadows Mall (which is still pretty far from a lot of people and has been deteriorating for years), for years you pretty much had no choice to either go there, hop around from strip mall to strip mall or venture all the way to The Strip, Henderson or The Outlets if you wanted to get any shopping done. Now me personally, I don't really mind travelling a little to get some shopping done (I mean, I like to have a wide variety of horizons to choose from ya know?), but this is a great new option to have around for those of us who aren't willing to hop around or venture. \n\nNow, there's not a large variety of stores yet, but expansion plans are already in the works. The ultimate goal seems to be turning the surrounding area into it's own mini-downtown of sorts, with not only retail and dining but also housing and workspaces. Being someone who adores new urbanism myself, that sounds nothing short of awesome to me. \n\nI really like how there's a \""range\"" of stores here so to speak. Upscale stores, like Sephora and Michael Kors next to Anytown, USA mall stores like Hot Topic and Foot Locker. There really is something for everyone, both by interest/personal style and income bracket. There's also a wide variety of dining options as well in addition to a ~luxury~ movie theater. \n\nNow I will go into why I would prefer for this to be a 3 1/2 star review: Most of the center is designed as a pedestrian friendly, semi-urban environment, and yet, while searching for certain businesses that seemed to be impossible to find, I discovered that they (Old Navy, Nordstrom Rack, Capriotti's, Five Guys, etc..) were in a separate strip mall section with a giant parking lot separating it from the rest of the center. This was definitely the biggest flaw in my opinion. It totally broke the flow of the new urbanist experience, especially seeing that there was no shortage of parking anyway. In addition to the fact it seems that aside from Zaba's, Panda Express and Wetzel's Pretzel's, it seems that all of the quick dining options were placed in this section which is definitely an inconvenience to those of us in the mall who'd rather grab something and go than sit down when the munchies strike. \n\nThe Final Verdict\n\nPros: \nMore convenient shopping option for the west side. \nNew Urbanist development\nPedestrian friendly\nDecent and accessible variety\nEasy to access with public transit\n\nCons:\nStrip mall section\nNot many options for \""grab and go\"" food\n\nReturn Factor: 10/10 and hopefully soon!"
3537	0	a	"I really like this place but just for my experience today I am giving it one star. Restaurants weren't well equipped to handle the Christmas shoppers at all but the worst part was the ice rink. This is what happened: Turned up with my daughter and paid the $30 entrance fee for the rink. First they didn't have my daughter's shoe size but assured us we could bring them back if the bigger size didn't fit. It didn't and one boot was broken anyway. As we watched the skaters we noticed there were no 'helpers' for younger children (the sleds kids get to help them keep their balance). In 2 minutes there were two serious injuries as the rink was packed - one head injury and one knee injury and both kids were crying, ice packs etc. Then everyone was called off the rink and the stress of the business and having nowhere to sit or store our things and not having the right size boots made me decide within a few minutes to take the ice skates back and ask for a refund. You would think they would have decent customer service and offer a refund immediately for the wrong boots alone, since they did not have the right size in stock , but they just said \""no we can't.\"" I asked for the manager who stood behind me and said the best he could do was comp us for another time. I did not want to be comped. I wanted my money back! I hadn't set foot on the ice and they could see that! Awful rink. They robbed me of $30 straight off the bat. Don't bother going there PLEASE."
3538	0	a	I hate this mall just as much as a I hate town square. Now, no doubt that its nice to drive directly to the shop you're looking for if you don't want to mosey around, but good luck finding parking in front of or even one street over from said shop. Being an outside mall, I don't like coming here on a cold day and I guarantee I won't be visiting at all if I can help it in the Summer. And my god, people walk around here like complete idiots, so drive slow and beware for morons who jaywalk and just generally jet out in front of you, likely just for shits and giggles or in an effort to collect on your full coverage auto insurance.
3539	0	a	"Welcome to Downtown Summerlin. The Mall that hates your children. \n\nAs a parent then watching this mall get built was so exciting. This quadrant of Vegas definitely needed a shopping area and even in their family fun filled opening it looked like they were doing everything right.\n\nBut once those opening day balloons deflated then it became clear that they didn't build this mall with children in mind. \n\nParks: There is NONE. During that opening weekend I didn't even notice since they had so many street vendors doing kids stuff. But on a regular day then there's absolutely nowhere to let your kids run around. (yes, there's the water monolith near the theater but that clearly isn't meant for kids. \n\nStores: the shoppes are mainly upscale which is to be expected. But where's the Children's Place? They have one of those \""don't touch the toys\"" Toy Stores and a Build a Bear but that's it. Even the Apple Store is missing it's little \""Kids\"" Table that is found in every Apple Store across the country. \n\nEvents: To be fair they are trying. sometimes they have events but they haven't matched up to the opening weekend. They had a horribly cast 6ft Elsa and 4'7\"" Anna at the ice rink and they buried Santa in that unused tent. \n\n\nI'm not slamming on the mall. We like it very much BUT it does definitely feel as if a more permanent kids area is missing and I hope they address it in that open field where the temporary skate rink was put up."
3540	1	a	"I saw Graz across my Yelp feed a few times with great reviews then found a Groupon. It's tucked in a little strip right by GameStop, (kinda hard to see from the road). The owner Marcus and employee Anthony were really nice. I enjoyed our conversation while they were putting together our order; which consisted of the Italian, the BL cheese, a salad and a children's chicken quesadilla. Everything was super fresh and tasted good, but nothing that made us say \""WOW!\"" Also without the Groupon, it would've been a bit pricy for what we got. Still...I'd come back again...mostly because I prefer supporting friendly local businesses such as this place."
3541	1	a	An amazing place for breakfast and lunch.  They use all natural products.  I loved the Cibatta bread!.  The owner and staff are so kind.  They have fresh juices too.  I will be back!  So much better than Subway or Paradise.
3542	0	a	It seems they have pretty steady local business and for that, I'm happy.  I do wish the restaurant success as the staff was very nice but my meal was very underwhelming and nothing I would even consider trying again.  For $9 I had a sandwich which left me hungry as it was awfully small.  The sandwich was pressed on the grill and still came out cold and flavorless.  For $25 for lunch for two, it should at least leave me full.  Good for them on the profit margin though.  Selling two slices of thin bread, 3 oz of roast beef, and a tomato for $9 is a lucrative racket.
3543	0	a	Great space, service is great, but the doughnuts were dry, frosting was over the top sugary, and there wasn't a great selection. We had chocolate glaze on raised, pistachio orange glaze on cake, and the choc chip cookie dough glaze on cake - all had the same problems.\n\nI'm hopeful that they're just working out the kinks.  There's definitely room in Phoenix for a solid doughnut shop.
3544	1	a	When you walk in you're greeted with a friendly staff, nice clean new updated styling. It's a fairly simple menu. I ordered the chicken k-bob. The cilantro jalape\u00f1o humus was good, could have been a bit spicier as I was expecting a bite out of it. It was fresh tasting tho. Rest of the ingredients are freshly cut. Chicken was super moist and very well seasoned and cooked. Pita bread could have been fresher, but overall the presentation and taste was very good. Portion size was also very generous. I usually need a good amount to actually feel full, and this actually filled me up, plus some. Could possibly be enough for two people to share. Pricing was decent. It's a nice little change of pace restaurant is you are in the mood for something moderately healthy and decently priced.
3545	1	a	Saw this place from the outside on my way to a training for work and knew immediately I would have to try the food and raw juice bar!! Went with the girls for lunch that day and we absolutely fell in love!! The food was amazingly delicious and we couldn't stop raving about every bite we took! On top of that we were able to customize a raw juice which I loved the idea of and the taste even more! Let's just say we were hooked from the beginning and went back for lunch everyday and for juices on breaks from the training.\nIsn't wasn't only the food and juice that brought us back..we were drawn instantly to the charisma of Nas and Sam and the attention they had to the atmosphere and attention to detail for their customers! I love the feeling of the place and you can tell that they live to a philosophy and not only to making money! I will be visiting as often as possible, even after the end of my training..they have made me a loyal customer
3546	1	a	Love this new lunch spot! My go-to is a hummus bowl with chicken. It's great to have healthy options close  to the office. I've never had any issues with the quality of food, although (like someone else mentioned) it seems like they're being a little more stingy with portion sizes, particularly the hummus. In spite of that, I would give 5 stars if I didn't think my order was a giant inconvenience to many of the staff. I know the lunch rush can be stressful but I just get the feeling some of the employees could use a little more patience. Great overall!
3547	1	a	Great opening!!!!\nFrom Winning Pig to this... Amazeballs!!! \n\nLove the Welcoming ambiance, just as their original Winning Pig!!!
3548	1	a	Went there Monday night...soft opening...It was packed. Great beer and wine selection. To top it off the bar tenders were awesome....Great service and a lot of fun.....Happy hour specials are perfect for that wine and beer lover....there were more of both then I ever seen....I am sure they will have your wine or beer of choice...go check it out
3549	1	a	The Pig's Meow is a man after my own heart. There is no shortage of drinking spots in Arcadia, but the neighborhood really needed something like this. A laid-back casual bar that is reasonably priced without being divey. They sell beer and wine, there's a ton to choose from, most of the brews are local crafts. As for food, they have grilled cheese sandwiches only for $5. I didn't get a chance to try these, but the other patrons who did seemed very happy with them. They have awesome happy hours of 3-8pm and reverse from 11-1am and all day Sunday, this really makes it easy to drink for cheap! For entertainment they have several 80's vintage gaming systems, have a beer, play some Centipede on the Atari, then some Mortal Kombat on the Sega Genesis, and finish it off with some Mario Bros. on the original Nintendo. If you're not into the electronic games they have plenty of other games like Guess Who, Let's Go Fishin' and Rock 'Em Sock 'Em robots (which I played for the first time ever that night). Also, they have my all time fave a LEGO wall!!! My husband and I left this place so excited knowing that we will return many times, and that this will be our future awesome watering hole!
3550	1	a	Pig's Meow, I think I'm in love.\n\nNew bar in the Arcadia neighborhood and after being open for only 3 days was packed!  Super cool atmosphere (how can you not love a place with old school games like Uno, Connect Four, and even Atari!), and overall really good vibes.  The bar is tucked away in an unassuming strip mall behind Bosa donuts, and there is a ton of open parking and bike racks for all of your transportation needs.  The beer menu is written out on the large chalkboard wall, and it's massive.  So many unique brews to choose from that I just had the bartenders pick for me and believe me, each one they suggested was fantastic.  They also have a variety of $5 grilled cheeses that are made fresh on the press.  I highly suggest the star (pepperoni/cherry peppers) or heart (fig/goat cheese) for the sandwiches.  Muy delicioso.  :)\n\nBest of all; they have DAILY happy hours until 8PM!!!  Seriously, 8pm everyday PLUS ALL DAY on Sunday's.  \n\nWithout a doubt, this is officially my new favorite spot!!
3551	1	a	Loved the beer choices, loved the video games, loved the board games. Came here for my birthday and couldn't have had a better, more relaxed, and exciting experience. Didn't get to eat due to busy atmosphere and late arrival.
3552	1	a	Super fun place! I love playing games and it makes it easy to meet new people and break the ice inviting them to play Cards Against Humanity with you. The video games also bring back fun memories and the possibility of making new ones. Their beer selection is huge! And the place has it's originality from the name, to the tables, even the glasses for the beers on tap sets them apart. Love it!
3553	1	a	This place is awesome! Fun and loud, but great for a small group. They have SO many beers and wines - its wonderful. They have games to play at every seat and even some classic nintendo and sega games. SO fun! We tried one of the grilled cheeses and it was yummy but could have been better with more cheese and meat. They have a killed happy hour too.\n\nI cant wait to take some friends there and hopefully be able to get a table with nintendo or sega!
3554	1	a	I am a fan of the Whining Pig. Big fan. This place is just like its sister, but it has draughts, grilled cheese, and classic video games... awesome! The happy hour prices here are slightly higher than at WP, but it's still a great deal. The bartender suggested a delicious beer that was just what I was looking for, so I appreciated that. All of the video game tables were occupied, so I'll have to get my Mortal Kombat on another time (of which I am sure there will be many), but I did get to enjoy some Pop Up Pirate and Battleship. Will be back, yay!
3555	1	a	The Whining Pig 2.0, that's exactly what this bar is. They took the major elements of what made the first bar awesome and expanded. Their beer and wine menu is an entire wall made of chalk board with their 50 or more beers and wines to choice from. The large majority of their beer selection is bottled and canned, but with the addition of a dozen or more draft beers. Tho they are mainly a beer and wine bar, they do have some amazing simple grilled cheese sandwiches that are worth the $5. \nThe best reason to come is for their Happy Hour which lasts until 8:00pm, so you have plenty of time to try out some new beers from their selection. The only negative thing I'd have to say is that since it's bigger then it's predecessor but has the same sort of layout plus tables, service is not as intimate and slower, Otherwise, another great place to have a bunch or beers and sandwiches.
3556	1	a	"It's rare that you find a place that is exactly what you've been looking for in a conversation spot, a pre-drink, a hang-out and \""let's go there\"" without experiencing a parking problem and obnoxious patrons.\nAs I have experienced it, the Pigs Meow appears to be one of the Phoenix/Arcadia concepts that has scored dramatically and is drawing a lot of attention in only two months. You'll love this place. I love it so much I'm holding off my review so I can enjoy the synergistic and soulfully crafted environment for now..."
3557	1	a	Good prices. Good beer selection. And they have games!! Video games, board games, card games, all for free! What a fun place! I'll be back for sure!!
3558	0	a	Being this well-known American chain, I made it a point to visit this location.\n\nI won't be doing that again.\n\nThe food is fine: burgers are fresh and delicious, fries are meh, rings are good.\n\nBut holy mother of god is this place *grossly* overpriced.\n\nMy family of 4 (one of which was a 2 year old girl) cost north of $50!\n\nSo while the food is delicious, you can still get better for *far far far* less.
3559	0	a	I was excited to see this supposedly great chain expand into Waterloo. I thought it was something worth trying. If I can summarize what Carl's Jr tastes like, it's overpriced Burger King food.\n\nTheir sizes are one size smaller than McDonald's. So a McDonald's large is a Carl's Jr medium. I ended up with a medium fry and medium drink that were a lot larger than I expected.\n\nThe fries were okay... they were your typical average frozen fast food fries. The burger was nothing special. It was just an over-priced version of a Burger King Whopper with cheese.\n\nMaybe the other specialty burgers are worth it, but then you'd be spending $15-20 per person and might as well go to a formal sit down restaurant.\n\nIn summary: Meh.
3560	1	a	"When I first heard there was going to be a new bouldering gym in Las Vegas, my initial thoughts were \""cool....not going to be a good place to train, maybe check it out when it rains and the sandstone is soaked.\""\n\nThen I came into the refuge and my mind was thoroughly changed.\n\nTo call this place a climbing gym is to use a misnomer, it truly is a training facility.  The  offerings of fitness and yoga incorporated with VERY good route setting really helps push this place to what Las Vegas has long needed.\n\nWithin a week of opening, the number of local hardmen and hardwomen I have seen frequenting this place reinforced what I had already suspected:  This place is awesome.\n\nIt has a very open feel to it, the walls are quite tall and downclimbing is an essential skill here if you value your knees/ankles.  Staff is fantastic as noted above, and most of the time they are wearing staff shirts.  Most climbing gyms I have been to I haven't been able to tolerate the 'bro' mentality and condescension many of the staff members have, that is absent here.\n\nI agree that it is a bummer that vending machines are the only food/drink options other than water here, also would be nice if they sold a few things like chalk and tape...but that is truly nit picking.\n\nThe owner is very active in the gym as is his manager, and both are very receptive to and often solicit feedback.  Now if only I could get stronger so I could climb some of those V-Thatisreallyfreakinghard problems..."
3561	1	a	"This place had fantastic \""melt in your mouth\"" tuna sashimi... The slices of sashimi could be cut a little thinner.    I had a delicious salad. They have clams, in a broth, that is amazing. We ordered about 14 items off the menu and it was all delicious. The portions are a nice size for tapas. The decor was very elegant. I enjoyed my experience at Izakaya Go.  Let's get Lil Soya in Izakaya Go!!"
3562	1	a	The food is delicious! Also the ramen noodle spicy level is just delicious! It's a good place to go with friends and chill. Good music.
3563	0	a	Izakaya Go was a huge let down.  I went for lunch the opening week and got the salmon teriyaki lunch.  It came with your standard miso soup, salad, rice, soft tofu, and creamy potato side dish.  The food itself was good and what you would expect from a Japanese restaurant, but the long wait killed it... not on it's own.  The long wait to order, to get tea, for the food to come out, and then needing to ask for a spoon for the miso soup.  I understand this was opening week and some kinks were probably being worked out so I decided I should come back during dinner to see the full tapas menu and give it another shot. \n\nThat day and the next they were doing 50% off the bill so the next day at dinner I recruited a friend to check out the tapas menu with me.  It was more of the same regarding service, despite having more than one server interact with us throughout the experience. This happened the previous day.  The other funny thing was the same primary server who tended to us at dinner was also the one who was taking care of me at lunch the previous day.  I understand when it's stupid busy and a lot of people are coming through, you can't remember everyone, but she didn't recognize me from the previous day even though she invited me back to check out this particular menu, and the place was never packed the both times I happened to be in.\n\nThe dinner menu is large and easy to get lost in, we got the chicken yakisoba which was great, the halibut roll, a couple other dishes that weren't memorable, my friend wanted the bacon asparagus dish, which had a hair in it.  We let the server know just so they could make the kitchen aware.  They apologized and offered us ice cream.  Overall the decor is very traditional and I can tell a lot of thought and care went into it.  The staff is friendly and I feel like they're trying but there has to be some disconnect between the front and back of the house.  The food was good but was coming out very slowly and sporadically, I think that's related to the previous statement. Oh and they have been picking the weirdest Pandora channels for music, it was mostly some super slow r&b and a couple Pandora ads. Some people might find it petty for me to mention it, but I noticed it and kind of found it entertaining.   I'm not sure if or when I'll try this place again because I feel like I got burned back to back, especially with the other reviews being so enthusiastic about this place.  Maybe I had bad luck both times?  I'll give it some time before taking another shot here, there are so many options explore in Chinatown alone, and all around Vegas.
3564	1	a	My new favorite Japanese restaurant! Izakaya Go is located on Spring Mt. and Valley View, same plaza as Krung Siam and Kuma Snow Cream. \n\nATMOSPHERE\nCame here around 7:30PM on a Saturday night, this place was slow. Walked in and was greeted by some friendly workers. I was very impressed by the decor/ambiance inside. I have been to Izakaya in Japan and this place has that authentic Izakaya feel: Cozy, warm and welcoming. Comfortable cushions on the wooden bench, lighting and overall atmosphere was fantastic.\n\nSERVICE\nOur server was helpful and gave some great suggestions. After getting our food, we were constantly checked by multiple workers there asking if we need more water, how the food is, etc. They are very attentive and friendly!\n\nFOOD\nThey have small dishes, sushi, noddle, rice bowls, etc. I decided to try one of the combination plate which came with cold tofu, miso soup, rice, salad, hijiki, takuan, potato salad and main dish of choice. I decided to go with Karaage combination plate. Karaage was crispy and flavorful! Came with a piece of lemon and mayonnaise as a sauce. My friend got a ginger pork combination plate which was flavorful as well. \n\nI appreciated the fact that all the small dishes that came on the side were all healthy and light. I also liked the miso soup here. Most places just serves the soup but miso soup here came with seaweed and tofu inside-exactly the way I like my miso soup except the soup was a bit on the saltier side. In addition, I enjoyed their creamy potato salad. It's not your typical sweet potato salad. Potato salad served here tasted like the one my grandmother used to make. I couldn't believe how good it was, yum!\n\nCONCLUSION\nHonestly, Izakaya Go is as good as it gets. I was impressed by their atmosphere, service and food. Def coming back for more!
3565	1	a	Legit Japanese food!! Good food, great service, what more can you ask for! Love their torinankotsu, goes GREAT with beer!
3566	1	a	This is one of the few places that is actually ran by people that speak and can cook a decent Japanese meal. The fish is very fresh and they have real Wasabi, not the fake tube crap they all other places serve. So when you mix it in, hold on to your taste buds. The ramen is also a nice treat. The service is very prompt and highly friendly. The only thing that I am sure will be fixed shortly is that they don't have their liquor license. Otherwise I would give them 5 stars. I do miss my sake.
3567	1	a	I've got izakaya fever and the only cure is... more Japanese tapas!\nHeads up that the lunch menu is more casual fusion fare (sushi burritos, for example) while the dinner menu is mostly authentic dishes, with a great board of specials- handily posted over each table for your drooling convenience.\n\nAs staples, I'd order the UNI CHAWAN MUSHI ($7)- delicate egg custard dish with uni and mushrooms, served in the cutest French china pot, which was second only to a phenomenal MUSHROOM PORRIDGE with egg (back page of menu by the rice bowls)- it's saucy and carby and comforting and flavorful all at once.  Not to mention packed with mushrooms.  \nOther favorite dishes include the CRISPY TUNA CRACKER, which manages to be both spicy and crispy without being too spicy or too crispy. The TEMPURA WHITE FISH ($6) is divine- I'd order several for the table, the flavorful, flakey fish goes fast. If it's on the specials menu, I'd consider the TUNA BELLY STEAK ($12) a must-order; the dipping sauce and perfectly-cooked interior make for an orgasmic bite.\n\nI did not originally plan on ordering sushi here, but was easily persuaded to try their sashimi specials- and the freshness of their fish rivals the top-ranked places in town. I also really enjoyed some of their simpler rolls, like the salmon and avocado- that section of the menu isn't too large and consists mostly of classic combinations.\n\nHeads up that orders may take a while if there are several large groups- it's a small place with a small kitchen. I would like to suggest that they NOT use the first table inside the door for groups, as squeezing my butt past someone's face is NOT my idea of a good start to my meal- nor one I would want to experience.
3568	0	a	Very disappointed !\nI have been eating at El Pollo Loco  for years but last night I was so disappointed the food that i ate it tasted so bad I won't come back here for a long long time.
3569	0	a	This is a bad El Pollo Loco location. I have been a few times on a lunch break and my food was messed up each time and I had to go back and have it corrected. I said I didn't want any guacamole or avocado yet it was on and in my food. I said I wanted a bean and cheese burrito and they put rice in it. I ordered a carnitas taco and got a chicken taco. The wait in drive thru or inside is ridiculous and waiting a long time and not even getting the right order only to have it done again just isn't right. I had a chocolate churro and it actually tasted burnt and nasty. Like a crushed up oreo cookie gone wrong. Definitely not one of the better locations.
3570	0	a	We live less than a mile away and elected to try Tides again, since we received a Station Casinos coupon for Tides. First off, the food is not too bad and we had no complaints. The bad news was our server. She failed to listen when we wanted to order our entrees, despite an appetizer order made at first. When she did return, she asked if I wanted a second beer, which I clearly told her yes. Well, 15 minutes elapse and I began to monitor our servers movements. It was no busier than most restaurants and I could sense that I was forgotten. I had to wave the hostess over. I advised that my drink never arrived and I had no water, despite my meal arriving. Despite my frustrations, I eventually let the server know when she asked if everything was ok. Now the excuses and attitude came out and all this did was to make me more frustrated. The Sous Chef was sent our way for my complaint. He was gracious and took my name and number, advising that he wanted us to be happy and return. He said I would be contacted. Three days later, no call. \n\nBTW, I refused to use the coupon which would make this visit look like poor folks looking for a cheap meal.  Also, I have never made a restaurant complaint in my life and typically am forgiving if there is a sincere effort. In this case, I'm still steaming about the server's attitude and poor service.
3571	0	a	This restaurant has the absolute worst service!  Not only did they make us wait 30 minutes for our table, when they clearly had two empty ones. It also took them 45 minutes to get our dinner out; they served us one person at a time,  so I was eating my dinner alone!
3572	0	a	Service was very, very, very, very lacking.  Gave up and went next door to the Sports Bar for drinks. Restaurant only half full. Took 45 minutes to take dinner order. Took another 45 minutes for Oyster appetizer to come out.  And the food? Maybe they delivered it to China???
3573	0	a	Im not sure if we just had a bad first impression or not but it seems as though we were wasting Dr. Webers time??  We went in for prescription  refills went to the pharmacy to pick them up and they were never faxed so now it seems as though we wasted or time. ..
3574	1	a	Great smog check! Offered free bottled water and a great little sitting area. Only 5min smog but friendly and courteous.
3575	1	a	Very happy. service was amazing! Went on my lunch break and it was super quick. They even gave me a free soda while I waited. Ron was great! Will definetely be back!
3576	1	a	Ronnie was super friendly and gave a discount!! Happy new year haha...not only was it close by but he got me in and out quickly!
3577	1	a	Awesome location, kids loved watching tv and looking at the colored waterfall! Staff is very friendly and made it easy for the kids.
3578	1	a	Great place to eat/order to go a quick shawarma. Its a family owned restaurant and the food clearly shows that. I like it!
3579	1	a	Top notch business! Such warm and loving people.
3580	1	a	Love this place! Spectacular customer service + delicious food!!! Can't beat that combination. We went for the Basial fried rice, the mixed veggies,  the thai fries rice, the fried shrimp,  the wontons, AND thai tea --- everything was perfect! Highly recommend and will be going back :)
3581	0	a	Sadly I don't know how the food tastes because after it took 2 hours to arrive, I sent the driver away. Won't be getting a second chance.
3582	0	a	"Food is the same found at any Chili's; however the service was seriously lacking.  We waited 20 minutes for our food to arrive and my wife got her salad at the same time as the main entree...poor form.  In addition, we order kid's meals at the beginning of our order; which come with a drink, but the drinks were not delivered until the main meal and they were 2/3 of the way full AND each time the waitress got refills on these (two other times), they were always delivered 2/3 of the way full...I thought it really strange why the waitress did not take the extra initiative to fill the drinks the entire way on a dinky little child size cup.\n\nAnd to make matters worse, the entire electronic pay processing devices were not working and our only form of payment was a Chili's gift card; which could not be read.  As a result, we had to wait \""10\"" minutes to pay the check; while the manager calls and gets verification of funds and so forth and so forth.  It wasn't a great visit in terms of time and waiting.  Hopefully this Chili's gets their act together for the future, because your customers will not want to come back otherwise.\n\nOh and by the way...you can forget the parking, because there is none!  I spent 10 minutes going from business to business looking for a place to park (i.e. Travelodge, Polo Towers, etc.) and there is absolutely not a single place to park for free).  We just drove to our hotel (the Cosmopolitan) and walked over."
3583	1	a	The restaurant being on the second level was difficult to find! Once we got in we were greeted with a sincere welcome and asked to sit on the patio.  What a phenomenal view and atmosphere! Our server was fantastic and the manager visited our table to make sure our service and meals were great!\nWe had the new burgers and they were phenomenal!
3584	1	a	I'm a big fan of chili's and having it on the strip is a great location.  I took my family here and sat on the patio.  We had a great view of the strip.  Our server was friendly and the food was awesome.  Overall the service was great i'll definitley come back.  If you live in the las vegas area or just visitng come check this place out!
3585	1	a	I noticed this shiny new Chili's on a recent trip to the Aria.  I LOVE a good buffalo chicken salad so I was pretty excited, but with so many great restaurants in the area, I figured I'd save my Chili's fix for the O'Hare airport (my favorite homecoming treat).\n\nOne morning/afternoon, after a really fun night out, I found the big red chili pepper, like a beacon in the night, calling me across the street for some 1000 calorie salad goodness.  I wanted to zip over real quick, pick up take out, and come right back to my room.  I have had the Chili's app on my phone for awhile in hopes that one of the O'Hare airport Chili's would let me order from the plane but no luck with that yet.  Fortunately, this Chili's allows you to order from the app.  It worked out great, I even got to customize my order and add avocado!  It's the little things.\n\nI headed out the door about 10 minutes before my order was due to be ready.  After all, this place is right across the street.  Plenty of time.  Upon reaching the end of the Aria drive, though, my fears were realized when I saw that I couldn't cross the street without traveling a couple of blocks in either direction down the Strip.  Obviously, this was crushing news in the blinding daylight and 101 degree heat.  About 20 minutes later  (I may be exaggerating) I finally reached my oasis.\n\nI found the stairway off to the side and headed up to the second floor location.  The interior is really nice.  It's open, spacious, and bright with tons of TVs around the bar.  I guess I never really eat inside of a Chili's so I didn't realize that they have touch screen ordering devices on the table.  You can order when you're ready while watching a game on one of the TVs at the bar...which you can totally see from your table.  It actually seems like a pretty cool place to hang out.\n\nNo one was staffing the take out area so I spoke with one of the hostesses.  It seems that there was some kind of mix up with my order so it took a bit of back and forth between the hostess and a guy who seemed like he might be a manager.  When they finally found the order, the register wasn't working so they had to process my payment in the back somewhere.  It was no big deal, though, the staff was all super friendly and apologetic.  The manager even threw in a ridiculous amount of ranch dressing (I have a problem, I know) because I mentioned that I like extra ranch.\n\nWhen I finally got my salad back to the room, it was beautifully packaged and the presentation was nice.  Unfortunately, it was SUPER salty.  I figure that they're still working out the kinks at this new location.  A little salt isn't enough to keep me away from this place.  I'm glad Chili's made its way to this new location.
3586	0	a	Me and my boyfriend came here on our last day in Vegas.  It was Sunday, wasn't crowded at all yet the service was poor and slow. Took forever to get a drink. Had 2 people take our drink order before it was even brought to us. I had a classic margarita (in a mug and super strong) my boyfriend got a beer that was barely even cold. Food was good, however when we received the bill and inquired about why we didn't get happy hour prices (happy hour all day Sunday) our waiter said that it was only at the bar and outside and we were never told that upon being seated. Really unorganized and lacking customer service skills. Hopefully with time it can improve. Until then I will not be eating here again.
3587	0	a	Why 2-Star rating? Because of the horrible service.\n\nI came in for dinner with my 2 boys, and requested for Strip view (it wasn't busy at all, plenty of empty tables around). We were offered the patio table, which we took happily. We've been seated for about 10min with no server to greet us, but since my boys were busy drawing their kids menu and I took some pictures of the view, I didn't mind it at first. Only until there was a couple who came and seated at the table next to us who got greeted by a server immediately that I started to get irked. He told them that he'd be back, as he had some dirty dishes on his hand. When he came back, he took their drink orders, and proceeded to go back inside until I stopped him and complained that I have not even been served since I got in about 10min ago!  He was apologetic and then he went inside, and sent another server to serve us instead!  The nerve of that guy!\n\nSo when the other server asked for our drink, I asked for the manager. He proceeded to do so, but never came back to take our order.  The manager himself didn't show up until some minutes later (I think about another 5-10 minutes), in the meantime, when the 2nd server came out, I asked if ANYONE will take our order at all. He said that he was under the impression that I wanted to talk to the manager without ordering anything. OMG! He didn't even bother to check or ask, just making his own assumption!\n\nWhen the manager came to our table, his explanation was that 2 servers were assigned the patio area, so that's where the confusion started, since one server thought the other already took care of our table. The manager ended up taking our orders instead.  Honestly, if it was not because my boys wanted to eat at Chili's, and that it was not past 7:30P, I would walk out and find another restaurant nearby!\n\nThe food was good, as what other Chili's standard, but service is truly lacking! When the food came, I realized that none of the server even gave us utensils and napkins that I had to ask for it. Really, are we supposed to eat our food with our fingers (I ordered steak & salad)??? And when I asked for hot sauce, it didn't come at all - not until the server came out again to see if I needed anything else that he realized that he forgot the hot sauce!\n\nWhen the bill came (for those who wondered, no, I didn't get any discount from the manager on my bill), I was so tempted to omit leaving any tips, but the civilized part of me prevented that and I left the minimum 15%.  Yelpers, if you experienced such service, would you leave any tips at all to the server?
3588	0	a	Terrible service here. Waitress was very inattentive, and Todd the manager was very unwelcoming. Will never dine here for the remainder of my stay.
3589	1	a	We caught them at a bad time. Most of the kitchen staff quit after new years eve. But we sat at the bar, watched TV and had a drink and an appetizer and a dessert it was a great time. The bartender was great worked hard to take care of us and was very friendly.
3590	0	a	Formerly known as Morrissey's, we used to love coming here for the quiet atmosphere, awesome food, and friendly staff.  This past Friday, my wife, myself, and my father decided to check out the new setup.  Upon first walking in, you will see that the dining area is gone and now that entire room has one pool table and a shuffle board.  Very sad, isolated room that would not be fun to play pool or shuffle board in.  We decided then to walk into the bar area.  There were a few patrons at the bar and at various seats around the bar area eating.  We sat ourselves close to the bar at one of the taller tables.  15 minutes go by, have not been greeted by a server, the bartender has made eye contact many times by this point but has not acknowledged that we were there.  VERY disappointed in the transformation to Sean Patrick's and the service we received, ESPECIALLY since it had only been open for 3 days !!!!!  WILL NOT BE COMING BACK.  Buffalo wild wings is right around the corner and they will continue to get all of our money.
3591	1	a	They're treats are AMAZING. The perfect mid-day snack, dessert, treat, anything!
3592	0	a	This is the restaurant with least effort to make a customer feel welcome I've ever experienced. Besides using the dining area as storage for boxes of supplies,the lady at the counter acted as though we were intruding on her personal phone conversation,barley taking the time to answer any questions we had. We ordered the lunch specials, got a small foam cup of water with a wanton in it ,the waiter pointed to where we get the spoons. The Kung Pao Shrimp was fishy smelling,served with dried out fried rice, with some sort of coating over the stinky shrimp, two young men came in as we were leaving and were warned, thanked us and went somewhere else.\nI didn't ask for a refund, because I couldn't wait for the argument, why don't these Chinese people take this seriously, like some of the others in town,and this was their Grand Opening ! I wish that Yelp had a lower rating than one star just for people and places like this! We left full plates and went ti Iron Chef on Tatum, Chinese owned and operated,fantastic food,Great sushi and very friendly.
3593	1	a	I checked this place out for their take-out lunch special and I ordered the shrimp chow mein with fried rice. It was pretty tasty but I did notice the portion size seemed small. I guess that's what a lunch special means. Also the shrimp themselves were tiny. Good flavor seasoned the noodles and also the fried rice. My friend ordered general Tso's chicken and he can be picky about chinese food so I was surprised when he said he liked it enough to go back in the future. The staff seemed friendly enough when we showed up to grab the food but the atmosphere did seem like this is more of a carry-out type location. I will definitely looking forward to trying other things on the menu in hopes they have a dish that will really blow me away.
3594	1	a	This review is for the delivery only as I have not stepped foot in the actual place.  Just ordered chicken with broccoli (without the broccoli and extra sauce...I know its strange) and kung pao chicken.  It came well before the estimated time and the delivery driver was courteous and nice.  The food... well let me just say I FINALLY found my Chinese delivery place in this area after a couple years of awfulness.  Great sliced pieces of chicken in a great sauce.  It was exactly what I was hoping for and I am very pleased to say the least.
3595	1	a	Amazing !! YOU HAVE TO TRY IT! Fresh, large portions, good selection. When you order out they are pretty quick. It's fun to watch them prepare the food too. My sister and brother in law love this place too. They are starting to be regulars...lol....
3596	0	a	From the beginning, they could not understand our phone number, address (we live on a street right next to cactus!) and our full order. After waiting over an hour and fifteen minutes, we finally receive our order, cold and incorrect.\n\nI recommend not ordering from this restaurant if you want quality service!
3597	1	a	I just purchased my first three-day cleanse from Sip! I cannot wait to evaluate how I'm feeling afterwards - I've heard nothing but good things. \n\nI want to take a moment to commend the staff at Sip. This being my first cleanse, Alex was so willing to talk me through each day. Even more, she helped me walk to my car with all the juice to be sure I wouldn't spill! WOW! What outstanding customer service.
3598	1	a	This is a very clean very well organized juice bar. I was very happy with what I ordered I think it was something with beets, pineapple juice, and celery.  I also ordered an elixir.  I think it was called the fighter. The women working there warned me that it was very spicy. I told them not to worry I would be fine, I like spicy things. Even while they were making it the woman insisted on taking out some of the seeds of the jalapeno. \n\nNeedless to say my elixir was not spicy at all. I appreciate their concern, but I really wanted to experience the spiciness of the drink.  I get headaches and migraines, and I think the spiciness sometimes helps them. \n\nI would definitely go back.  I would like to try other things. I like that they open at seven in the morning so that I could go there before work.
3599	0	a	"Driving through an area of town, where we normally aren't, looking for food, without a preference, my wife and I both spotted a sign for PameZan Subs at the same time. Hooking a quick U-turn, we pulled into the parking lot and almost didn't go in. \n\nThe front doors were both propped open, an extension cord was through the entrance, to where staff members were hanging a sign/banner on the side of the building. Not sure if they were actually open, or almost ready for business, we walked in, and were prepared to have to leave.\n\nA nice lady walked in, and had someone who was still on the clock come up and take our orders. The cashier/order taker was a very nice lady, with an interesting accent. They turned on the TV when we sat down, and I asked if they could put it on a specific channel. Not knowing if they had the channel or not, she handed me the remote, and said I could pick something to watch. \n\nBefore our food arrived, the cashier said/did something that drew the ire of who we are pretty sure is the Owner, Christopher. Christopher decided that on the line (which butts up against the dining area, with an open-air kitchen) was the perfect place to berate, and belittle this employee. A moment later, another employee came in, and asked the cashier a question. Christopher again was loud enough for us to hear, as he told the inquisitive employee, \""Don't ask her that, don't ask her anything, ever. She doesn't know anything. Ask me if you have a question.\"" Or something pretty dang close to that.\n\nMy wife's food came out first, a few minutes later mine was delivered, Christopher made light that he forgot to make my food when he started making my wife's lunch. \n\nNeither of our meals were above average, they were disappointing even. \n\nMaybe it was a case of the \""just openeds\"" - or their recipes are just bland and unappealing to us. \n\nNot sure if we will give them a try if they make it, until we are in that area, and hungry again."
3600	0	a	I'm sorry to write a bad review since the restaurant is new, but we paid close to $20 for a giant Parmesan chicken sandwich that was barely edible. First off, the chicken was cold, tasteless, and was hard like it had been cooked for quite a while before we ordered it. Secondly, the chicken wasn't any different than the breaded frozen chicken tenderloins that you can purchase at Sam's club. Finally, one would think that a place named Parmezan Subs would specialize in Parmesan Chicken Subs and that this particular item on the menu would be a safe bet for flavor and value. Not so...\n\nIt's too bad because we really liked the hostess who greeted us and told us that they'd only been open for 8 days so far. Sorry to say we won't be giving them another try.
3601	1	a	Just discovered a hidden treasure. I haven't had a meatball sub this good since I was back in Little Italy. The shop is a family run business and the owner, Chris, came out to greet us and check on us during our meal. I can't wait to try more of their food....it's so good even the Corleone's would eat here! 'Leave the gun, take the cannoli'
3602	0	a	That all you can eat thing is a joke. For 12 dollars yes you get unlimited pasta but it's not an exaggeration to say it came straight from a can of Prego. There is no protein in the pasta, straight up noodles and sauce. The caesar salad is probably one of the worst I've had in recent memory, only good thing was bread and butter.\n\nService wise the cashier was nice but slow, I'm assuming due to a new location she took a while to get the order from the first guest. The head chef in the back is practically yelling at another worker in the back, something that shouldn't be done in plain view. Anyways long story short the pasta sucks try something else.
3603	1	a	first time there tonight,being from new york i know great italian food,i had the chicken parm with pene & soup. the owners & the people that work there are very nice.will definitely be back real soon for another great meal.
3604	1	a	Nice open and clean space. Owners were outgoing and really friendly. Ordered chicken parm sub with side pasta, meatball parm sub, and pasta and meatballs. Everything was delicious!  Best part was how great the food was when we took it for take out (which we do A LoT of)   Usually bread get soggy and food cold but not from here. Food was piping hot when we ate it at home and still crispy. Wished I had tried some dessert because it looked amazing, definitely something to try next time
3605	0	a	My husband ordered the sausage and peppers sandwich.When it came out it was very messy.Which was ok tasted pretty good...later that night he was so sick with stomach pains....Something was not right,maybe sausage not cooked enough?We probably won't be back....Saw other people leave with only half eaten pasta dishes.The pasta looked prettty blah....
3606	1	a	Loved the food and the atmosphere.\n\nSplit the Chicken Parm and Lemon Fresc with my girlfriend and it was absolutely delicious. I will definitely have to come back soon.
3607	1	a	Vermicelli with roasted pork was bomb. Servers need to understand all played should come out together. Otherwise, the service wasn't that bad. Really enjoyed the food. Nice and clean!
3608	0	a	If you are an asian or familiar with asian food then do not come here. Food are terrible! my wife could cook 10 times better.  Ice coffee tastes like water.   Service is horrible.\nWill never come here again. Do not waste your money.  Doan 's place is alot better.
3609	1	a	This place is LEGIT! A lot of Vietnamese places in my area really only just do the pho (and maybe vermicelli) well, but this place also does some other, less popular Vietnamese dishes.\n\n+ The large pho is MASSIVE. It could maybe feed 3-4 people (and I might suggest eating it this way and going family style on a few other dishes so your dinner isn't just one note consisting of a giant pot of pho)\n+ Generous portions of greens, with culantro? which isn't always offered at some pho places\n+ The salted limeade drink was an adventure! Definitely a more traditional Vietnamese drink that is an acquired taste. It might be more refreshing to drink on a hot day, I think.\n~ Baby clams with sesame cracker. YES! Fun to eat and delectable--my family really descended on this plate. Really popular with us. However, I think it could have used more of an acidic element.\n~ Knowledgeable, friendly, and helpful service (our waitress was nice enough to give us another cracker on the house), but could use a little more confidence.\n- The spring and summer rolls were a little pricey to me, but maybe it's because I usually buy them cheaply at fast food Viet places... Pho was just over $8, rolls were closer to $3-4 for small portions and vermicelli and other dishes over $10.\n\nIn summary, this place is worth a visit. Oh, and the bathrooms are super nice. ALWAYS a big +plus there. The atmosphere overall is relaxed, well-lit, spacious, with some pretty details. Keep it up Saigon Bay!
3610	0	a	"Been here 5 times and I can say that the food is either a hit or miss.  This time around I ordered the \""Com Dac Biet\"", which consists of a pork chop, shredded pork skin, quiche, egg and egg roll.\n\nWhat I wasn't expecting was a burnt-dried quiche, a small hair presumably head hair and another ahem* hair.\n\nI will not be coming back."
3611	1	a	Hey, they may have had a bumpy start due to some technical issues but they have more than made up for it. Excellent service, super friendly staff and excellent food. Even the owner stopped by just to be sure everything was meeting my expectations. I will be back and I will spread the good word.
3612	0	a	Went here for lunch. The place wasn't too crowded. The inside of the restaurant is very nice and clean with it just opening recently. \n\nI got the atomizer sandwich was close to $9. It took them close to 45 minutes to make the sandwich. The sandwich itself was average at best with pretty basic ingredients. I think that $9 for a basic roast beef sandwich is a bit steep too.  The waitress had no idea what any of us had ordered when she brought the food out (I ended up getting charged for a Reuben). The bright spot of the lunch were the potato chips. The chips were excellent with a subtle ranch seasoning. The whole lunch experience took almost an hour and a half.\n\nI probably won't be coming back.
3613	1	a	I went here with a bunch of friends from school. We were all on a budget so were very appreciative of the awesome prices! The decor is super chic and urban. As a group, we ordered the mac and cheese bites as well as the pub pretzels. The mac n cheese bites were delicious, and the pub pretzels, holy cow! With the honey mustard, they are incredible. I ordered the five cheese pizza. It wasn't so great unfortunately, but I tasted some of my friends dishes which were all pretty good. The homemade chips are also super good. For dessert, they had a turtle brownie that we split that was quite good as well. The service was amazing-our server was happy and helpful, more than happy to write up 5 separate checks and even split our appetizers and dessert between them all. We really had a great time and will return!!
3614	0	a	Oh my friggin' God! Arrived to the theater at 10:10am movie started at 10:30 did not make it to theater until 10:45! 35 min to get tickets and a soda!! Sooooooo friggin slowwwww!
3615	0	a	"I will start with the good, recliners alcohol & good hot food (burgers....)\n\nOther than this being a knockoff attempt at the Galaxy theaters, that is where the good ends. I am surprised at the 5 star ratings here as the consumer is truly getting screwed here. Why? Regal in its infinite wisdom to ensure Red Rock Regal maintains its sweet profit margin is restricting the movies shown at the \""nice\"" luxury theater. Yes, mostly the shows will be Geri-rated. Snore! So if you want to view a blockbuster and also would like to sit it nice reclining seats go to a Galaxy theater where they are trying to screw you over.\n\nBut the theater is nice."
3616	1	a	Finally a decent movie theater where we can reserve our seats and enjoy a glass of wine while enjoying our movie on comfy Lazy Boy style seats!  No more arriving an hour before showtime in order to stake out decent seats!  \n\nI really don't understand why there are so many reviewers who made it a point to trash this theater.  We should support theaters like this in Vegas because there are seriously not enough of them here.  \n\nThey have to work on improving some things like faster service and a more extensive menu which is constructive feedback.  But, overall the concept is great and the seats are extremely comfortable.  As is, it is already better than any other theater in Vegas.  When things settle down a bit parking will be a breeze and there will be plenty of restaurants to frequent before or after the movie at Downtown Summerlin.\n\nAlso, I heard from one of the employees that if the theater does well, they may install buttons in the theater seats to call for service at your seat! Imagine, being able to order a cocktail and have comfort food brought to your seat. Everyone should try this theater and spread the word.
3617	1	a	I liked the new Downtown Summerlin location. The option to walk around the shops before you go to your movie is made possible by Regal Fives reserved seating.   \n\n    The dark leather, extra roomy, and reclining seats were absolutely amazing. I appreciated the dark leather color v/s the gaudy red color at other places.   No knee pain during and after a movie is priceless.  \n\n     Sat in the third row because we got there 20 minutes before the movie started. We were by no means to close to the screen. The picture quality was excellent.  The previews were a little loud but the movie was fine.\n     \n  A  lot of times when we go to a movie we have a problem deciding where to sit.  If we sit in the middle we have a great view, but it is a major pain to go to the bathroom or get refreshments during the movie. Everyone must stand up or move their bags, feet, etc. This is not only a hassle for us but for  the other patrons. If we sit on the aisle, we do not have quite the same viewing experience, and we stand up every time someone leaves.  At the Regal Five, no matter where you sit there is plenty of aisle room to conveniently move around. Even when the chair is fully reclined. \n\n    I enjoyed the ambiance of the lobby. The lobby was smaller then a normal movie theatre lobby. ( We came in the afternoon, so I am not sure if we would have had the same experience at night).   The lobby had a nice atmosphere. There are a couple of places to sit while you wait, and I felt like I was at a restaurant. The bar was separate from the concession stand, which I thought was a nice added touch. It is equipped with an espresso machine and I had an amazing cappuccino. My boyfriend had a coke from the concession stand.  We do not drink so I cannot review the alcohol quality. The concession stand was clean and the floor was clean. A lady ordered a burger and they handed her one of those square vibrating beeper things that light up, so she would know when her food was ready. We will order food next time we go and I will update you on the quality.  We like to eat. However, I am curious if they would bring the food to you.  \n\n     The movie theatre was clean and the bathrooms were nice and clean as well.  No popcorn thrown everywhere, no food on the floors, and no weird smells.  The bathrooms were conveniently located and extra clean.  I hope they continue to keep this standard.  I was going to give it 4 stars but the cleanliness moved it up.\n\n   The only reason for 4 stars would be the movie selection. Do not expect to see a blockbuster here. We will be going to see Nightcrawler Oct. 30.  3:45 showing.  We reserved our seats on fandango and we picked our desired seats.  i found this to be very convenient. We will be ordering food, and I will be updating you on the experience and quality. \n\n    Overall, we found the experience to be highly enjoyable!
3618	1	a	Loved this theater.  The movie selection is slim, but the quality experience makes up for it.  You get to see how packed it is, and pick your seats when you buy your tickets! Beer and wine with real food. The staff informed me that soon, they will bring food to you in the theater. Will come back again and again. Just hope they have better movies when the blockbusters come out.
3619	1	a	"My boyfriend and I have come to this location several times now. The whole appeal of the comfortable chairs is what really brought us here. It is best to buy your tickets online before hand because the seats actually fill up very quickly. I had bought a pair of tickets before I started to shop then a friend wanted to join us, but it was already too late - it was literally a 10 minute difference. \n\nThey have a normal concession stand where they sell the usual popcorn, nachos, and etcetera. They also have a menu with better food like...I forget but it was alot better. They also had a bar where you can order drinks to take to the theater or they can be delievered to your seat if you just show them your ticket stub. \n\nThe seats are very comfortable and you can seat two people to a \""couch\"" I suppose. Its very clean. I wouldnt suggest taking off your shoes or anything though since you dont know who else has done the same...GERMS! \n\nThe only thing that sucks about this theater is that they only have FIVE theaters hence the name stadium 5 I suppose. They only have select movies as well. Like if an Avengers movie were to come out, they most likely wouldnt have it. They have movies here that wouldnt necessarily have hordes of people waiting in line for it. For example, I saw the Stephn Hawkings movie, The Theory of Everything. It was a good movie, bbut not for everyone.\n\nAll in all, if they have a movie playing that you wanna see, come here and not Red Rock! the luxury seating really does make a difference. It's not even more expensive to do so."
3620	1	a	I gave this two tries and it meets all expectations.  I enjoy the very comfortable, reclining seats with footrests.  Watching a 2 hour plus movie becomes a very good experience (if the movie cooperates).\n\nMy experience at the box office has been quite good.  I have several passes to Regal cinemas and there's an up charge of $1.50 for coming here.  No question of what I'll do if there's a movie I want to see.  I'll be coming here.\n\nI do like the reserved seating option.  I checked on Fandango and I knew where the pre-sale seats were.  This was confirmed at the box office when I picked my seat for today.  I chose the back row, just left of center, and it was great.\n\nMy 5 star rating will have a + after it in my mind when the kiddies go back to school and their parents stay away from theatres during the day.  I won't have to put up with the parents' texting!
3621	0	a	Went there after reading write ups about being a wining and dinning theater.  This was a big disappointment after going to adult only wine and dine theaters in Washington State.  There, the seats not only recline, but you have a call button for ordering drinks and food which is then served to you.  Food was on a plate and not in wrappers which made a lot of noise.The electric reclining seats were the only thing going for this theater.  I will not be back for drinks and food.  It wasn't worth it.  We made a special trip to this theater, thinking it would be like others we have attended.  I can sit in my own living room and watch a movie in reclining seats.
3622	0	a	It's nice & new, but it's fairly small.  Lack of variety & selection in all areas.\n\nWas looking for women's shoes, specifically kitten heels for a wedding, and there wasn't even one option for me.\n\nMy boyfriend was looking for a navy blue suit.  They don't even carry Alfani brand suits, just dress shirts. He found one by Bar III, but it only comes in slim fit, AND they didn't have his size.  \n\nSo when I said small selection and not much variety, that's what I meant.  It's good to have this close by, but they could have done a better job and made it bigger.  \n\nOnly saving grace; has a Starbucks inside near the men's section.\n\nAT&T users: Spotty/No reception inside
3623	0	a	I was really looking forward to having a Macy's so close to home. In all fairness, I understand this a brand new location, and it may take some time to get things right. I'm writing this review in hopes of being heard. I would LOVE to have a Macy's so close that I can actually shop at.\n\nI agree with one of the other reviews about the selection or lack there of. This has to be one of the WORST department stores I have ever visited, as far as selection goes. I'm a pretty conservative woman in my 30's.....the women's apparel that has been selected is just terrible. I feel as though it is TOO conservative. If I was looking for new church clothes or something to wear to a conservative political function, I would shop here. There needs to be more options for women that have professional jobs AND still like to be stylish. Your shoe department is pretty awful as well. Please, please, please give us something we can wear to work that's hip and professional, and something we can wear out for dinner or cocktails.(besides a formal gown)\n\nThe staff is SUPER FRIENDLY. I can't tell you how many times they asked if I needed help. I would have loved to have spent money here....the staff is GREAT!! They seemed aware of the selection issues. \n\nFingers crossed it gets better! :)
3624	0	a	"This Macy's is new & nice. I wish I could say that for the staff. I was purchasing a coat & at the register there was a messy pile of children's clothing laying on the counter. I picked one up to look at it was was told to \""STOP\"". The store employee who looked at least 80 yelled at me & told me not to touch it. I then walked away without purchasing a coat. TERRIBLE customer service!!!"
3625	0	a	"Just a horrible overall experience.  I came in to buy pajamas and a winter coat for my daughter.  They only had 2 kinds of pj's in her size. And 1 color for a coat. Horrible selection. ...horrible customer service. It took almost 15 minutes to have my question answered from an assosiate. I also was not able to use a coupon that I had because it specifically excluded their on day sale items. ..well 95% of their kid clothes were on their \""one day sale\"". Also their escalator was broken so we had to go to the other side of the store to take the elevator. There were no signs anywhere for it so yeah that was fun looking for it.  I will not be returning to this store."
3626	0	a	"Was at store in women's department at 8:00 p.m. on Saturday.  No more than 3 shoppers, 3 saleswomen doing nothing, and no one offered to help while on the floor, to check on dressing room to see if I needed a different size, etc., until I was trying on my last dress.  Then she ended up talking about herself the whole time.  I was asked if I wanted to join a \""buyers club,\"" or something to that effect, to receive a discount on future purchases.  I asked twice if there was a fee, was told no, and then saw on the screen it was ringing up as a $25 charge.  Really poor form here, out and out lying to a customer.  Unfortunate in any kind of establishment, but really I thought better of Macy's."
3627	0	a	This company is the absolute worst!  Do not purchase furniture from Michael at this location!  He and the whole team act as if they are competent and know what they are doing however fact is I purchased a couch October 26th with a promised date of November 5th, the 5th came and I was told it would be in the warehouse the 12th that they were gone for Veterans Day...  What warehouse lets their employees off for 8 days for Veterans Day??  The 12th came and I was told it would be there the 19th. 19th came and Michael told me it would be there the 26th.  Seriously??  The day before Thanksgiving??  So he set delivery for December 4th. The truck arrives and is missing 3 of the 6 pieces. Back and forth with the warehouse, not 1 word from Michael because what does he care, he got his commission, they promised delivery of the rest of the pieces on the 6th. Here we are on the 6th and two of the rudest delivery drivers I have ever encountered in my life and then of course it's the weekend so no one of importance is working!  They have no care that they are affecting my time. DO NOT BUY FURNITURE FROM MACY'S!!!!
3628	0	a	"So today, I was on my way home from running around the entire city. Since I live across the freeway from this mall, I decided I'd stop for pantyhose/tights (for a Christmas party I'm going to).  \n\nFirst of all, if you want any cute tights, or the fun ones with bling or cute designs...or anything updated and contemporary in terms of tights/hose...don't expect to find any here!! \n\nAnyways, I found a pair of plain black tights (mashed on the wall with unlike styles and with no sort of organization or merchandising skills applied - per typical Macy's standards I guess).  I found another pair since they were 2/$22 hue deal and I grabbed a pair of black leggings.  \n\nSo I turn to see 8 people in line at this one checkout station, then walk across the floor to another checkout station with 10 people waiting.  I'm clearly standing in the middle of the aisle holding product to buy...and the lovely Aspen appears. \n\nNow, I saw her trying to fly by me without greeting or any type of extension of customer service skills. But I saw the name tag and the portable printer on her hip...I yelled after her \""excuse me? can you ring me up?\""  \n\nOooooh man!!! She looked like I just ran over her foot. \n\nShe literally said to me (first words) \""if you're paying credit. And if you want a bag, go to a register\"". \n\n\nI wanted to say \""FU$& YOU ASPEN\"" but I didn't want to sink to her crap level. \n\nInstead, I said \""yeah, credit card. I'm fine with that as long as nobody talks to me on my way out...as I'm holding these things in my hands.\""  \n\nShe didn't say a word.  She started scanning. Asking me to hold this like that. And let her out the sticker there. Um, YOURE WELCOME ASPEN.  She was a total B!! the whole time. Not one, thanks for helping. Or thanks for holding this. Upon printing my receipt, her words were \""here's your receipt\"". \n\nAgain, no thank you. Or come again. Or sorry we have such long lines. Or happy holidays. So rude. \nASPEN, you are terrible. If you hate your job, go do something else.  Or stay home. Be angry at home. Because honey, angry attitudes and retail don't mix. \n\nOn Monday, I'm probably going to call the store manager."
3629	1	a	Stephanie is my go-to gal. I can always trust her to be honest about what would work best and look best for my hair type, face shape, bone structure and coloring. She is up to date on the current trends and seasonal changes, and can make a recommendation on what I should do next. I can say how many people have complimented my highlights and low lights, and I have had several people come up to me and say they are a hair stylist, and ask me to find out which dye numbers my stylist uses so they can use the same on someone they know with my brown hair color. I will never go anywhere else!
3630	1	a	Stephanie has been doing my hair for 8+ years! She's become my friend, not just my hair lady. She is passionate and knows what she is doing.
3631	1	a	What a great place! You are welcomed in and introduced to so many flavors and combinations of olive oils and balsamic vinegars that you get to taste while on a guided tour of the store. The staff is super friendly and knowledgeable. Great addition to our area!
3632	1	a	If you looking for oil oil with flare or not your ordinary balsamic this is the place. My husband took the day off with me and off we went. There are so many combinations of olive oil mixed with balsamic it head my head spinning. The owners were extremely knowledgeable and went out there way to make us feel like mixologists. If your  looking for a Christmas idea please stop by. You can find something for everyone!
3633	0	a	I have to say I was super excited about a Golfsmith opening a store in Summerlin.  I frequented Golfsmith in Woodland Hills CA quite often and am a recovering golf hoe.  I was truly afraid of how much damage this place would inflict on my bank account.  \n\nUnfortunately, I don't think Golfsmith will have to be concerned about my problem.  I've been to the store 5-6 times and the experience has been relatively consistent but in a negative way.  The sales people seem like nice guys but will only bust their ass if the perspective customer look the part.  Maybe its my problem for not looking the part lol but they should try to be helpful to everyone.  I understand if its a crazy busy day and they have to customer profile, but it was dead and they prefer to putt around than help potential customers.\n\nAt the end of the day, I am more saddened that I have to write this review because I was really looking forward to pitching in and do my part to ensure  downtown summerlin and its tenants get off to a solid start.  But I can't in good conscience spend money at a place where laziness is kinda apparent.
3634	1	a	Went in to buy a Christmas present for my husband. My children wanted to get him a set of shoes in a specific color and some MoJo balls. The sales people were super helpful and the new store was a place I will visit again.
3635	0	a	This is a racial & gender discriminatory store; if you are not a white male you may not be served the same.  They won't greet you or serve you.  Tried it three times.  Never failed on their ignorant policy!!  Three times a charm!  You are out of my shopping destination as a whole.  Won't give you business from now on!
3636	0	a	There were some ominous clouds overhead for much of the day - guess they didn't realize that we were VIPs or something. Luckily they seemed to stay away, at least as long as we were there. Unfortunately, we weren't there long. As Jeff says, you can only go around in a circle so many times (and more importantly, it was a pretty small circle).\n\nAnother good point he made is that though there were plenty of folks hanging tough in the face of that nasty-looking cloud, easily the best vendor was the trailer from Southern Pines. The rest of the folks just seemed to phone it in. In fact, many didn't even do that - a decent number of the booths were staffed with volunteers of the charity (and there isn't anything wrong with that), but the volunteers didn't know anything about what they were serving.\n\nHey, if you're going to go through the trouble of coming out for a cause, at least go through the trouble of learning about what you're doing. It takes two minutes, and makes the experience so much better. Instead, they were just pouring (and it's good they got that down) and barely handling that - at least one person was manning two of the tables.\n\nAs to the event itself: Meh. The catered food in the VIP was pretty cheesy. There was a quesadilla at first, but I think it was literally a quesadilla. After the first one was gone, I don't think they ever brought out another. The trailer with the couch was kinda cool, but there were about five chairs, and they said they had a hundred VIP tickets? No way that would have worked if everyone showed up back there. Plus, even the craft-but-not-craft beer in the VIP section wasn't working for the first little bit. That's just a little odd.
3637	1	a	I had the Amazon Locals vouchers and it was an amazing experience. Ayla, our guide was as cool as they come.. very friendly and down to earth. Horses (Hero & Candy) were really nice too. the whole experience was amazing. We were scheduled for an hour and a half but it took an extra 15 minutes since we stopped for pictures.\n\nI received an email that requested to confirm appointment. Also instructions when to arrive, where to park, and where to meet the staff. \n\nThumbs up.. I'll definitely will bring more friends to experience this.
3638	0	a	I contacted them regarding the Amazon special...they said they would offer the price without purchasing it thru Amazon.  I made a reservation, had an email back confirming it, then NEVER heard from them again!!!  I emailed three times the week before my reservation to confirm, and also left a voicemail.  NO RESPONSE....and therefore no traiil ride!!  I had booked it to take people who were in town visiting.  I will never trust this place again...I would NOT recommend buying their coupon.  So disappointing.
3639	1	a	We had an amazing ride! The staff was super friendly and ALL the animals were great!! We got our deal off LivingSocial and it went off without a hitch! Purchased online, followed the easy instructions, and got a confirmation email quickly. I decided to change my time, and they accommodated us without any problems. The horses were fantastic and so gentle! We had a mini scare with my horse taking me off the path and straight down the hill!! It was scary but she had great balance and I survived. LOL \n\nWe definitely want to return again!!
3640	0	a	Tried to book a ride with them on their web site.  I intentionally did not put my credit card number in because their site is NOT SECURE. Right after I booked my appointment I sent them an email letting them know that I'd be more than happy to give my credit card but let them know their site wasn't secure so I didn't feel comfortable booking it this way to let me know how to contact them.\n\nThey sent me an email making me wrong for not putting my credit card in and letting me know they were going to cancel my reservation.  I responded nicely letting them know why (again) and to provide a phone number for where I could call it in (and I had a couple more questions).  Never heard back from them again.  Went on Living Social and cancelled my voucher.\n\nI don't know if they are or not, but the way they handled this makes me feel uneasy and that they are shady.  Would not recommend based on my experience.
3641	0	a	Wanted to go here during our trip to Vegas this Christmas. Confirmed by email that they would be giving rides around Christmas. Then bought the Living Social, filled out the booking request form on their website, then ... NOTHING! No confirmation. After several unanswered emails, I called Living Social for a refund. Turns out, the business had already marked my voucher as 'redeemed' even though I have not yet been to Las Vegas. Note: it is their policy to NOT answer phone calls/return messages. In my case, apparently, it's their policy to not respond to emails either.
3642	1	a	This place is amazing! You never know what clever specials might be on the menu. Anything smoked here is always good. Staff is so welcoming.
3643	1	a	Talk about GREAT customer service ! I came in earlier this week with my mom. The lady helping us was patient while we looked around and decided on a jacket go my boyfriend. I came back today with my bf to return it because it didnt fit him and the same lady came up to me and remembered about the jacket asking how it fit ect. As we were leaving another young lady made sure we had found everything okay and asked about the jacket as well. Maybe they just have good memory but I think thats amazing.  Always friendly & great stock in clothes
3644	0	a	New location, same crappy attitude. I dislike most of the people that work here. They are usually pretty rude. Their selection is ok although I think their prices are high for used clothing. Very rarely someone will approach you to see if you need any help.
3645	1	a	I'm gonna start out with the customer service. The store has great customer service. From people helping me find what I was looking for to the person working at the register. I love how they start up small talk. It makes me feel like I'm not just a walking dollar sign.\n\nThe clothing for men is also pretty outstanding. I always find shirts that I really can't get in most places in Las Vegas. I honestly don't get why other people think its expensive. I usually only spend a max of $30 and get at least 3-4 decent shirts. That's kind of hard for guy shirts especially if you want them to be unique.\n\nOverall I think the new place is better. They have a better selection of clothing. \n\nI highly recommend it if you want to find clothing that are mostly affordable and unique
3646	1	a	This location is much larger and nicely decorated then the previous location. Lots of designer brand clothing for men and women. Hats, scarfs, belts, shoes, jewelry, coats (in season), wallets, sunglasses, socks, vintage clothing and several unique things are available all of the time. Seems like the prices are higher at this location. They buy and sell at this location. If you sell your items, they offer 30% in cash (of their selling price for your item) or 50% in trade (items from within the store or other Buffalo Exchange locations).\n\nPROS: Large store\n            HUGE selections of designer brands\n            Sale items are 50% off\n\nCONS: Higher prices\n            Dimly lit inside
3647	1	a	We've been spending most our lives living in a hipster's paradise...\n\nSo they moved from the ghetto on flamingo and maryland, catering to the UNLV crowd, to the revamped ghetto of downtown, where the secret society of hipsters unite. The store is much larger, the selection is awesome, and the feel of the store is overall pretty swanky. I came in to sell and didn't have too much time to look around, but my buy went very well I will happily return. \n\nTIP: No parking lot at this location. Street parking only.
3648	1	a	Love a Nordstroms Rack... This one is exceptional, great selection, clean, organized & in general a good vibe. We are delighted that Nordstrom's put a Rack in Downtown Summerlin.   Just hope they get they get some more larger size ladies shoes & tall girl items!!
3649	0	a	I will wait to go back until the novelty of Downtown Summerlin wears off. This place was so packed it was claustrophobic. People were pushing and it was hard to walk anywhere without running into someone. We couldn't wait to get out of there. \n\nEmployees in neon green t-shirts were sporting the deer in the headlights/thousand yard stare and were useless. \n\nPrices were jacked up for Summerlin of course. Everything looked picked through and thrown around. I didn't find anything under $100. Went home to browse their website and found some deals. \n\nI hope they improve after the new wears off. I had been looking forward to this location opening but this looked as bad as Burlington before Easter!
3650	1	a	"Love Love Love! \nFirst of all I always think you should wait until a place is \""broken in\"" before you review.  \nopening day? yea its gonna be busy, its gonna be packed, there will be untrained people hired yesterday.  Its how openings go.. \n\nIf you're unfamiliar the rack is about 1/2 discounted nordstroms merch and 1/2 merch ordered for this store.  \nNordstrom has the best return policy ever (ie. they take anything back from anytime) so you'll find returns (that couldn't be resold) as well as extras and unsold clearance.  \nIve gotten many a \""worn and resoled\"" amazing shoes! \n\nTheres about 20 fitting rooms so theres no waiting.  like ever.  And anyone in a lime green shirt can ring you up at any spot (sorry only cards, no cash) \n\nLong story short, go with an open mind... you can't go in to get a specific shoe or shirt.  But if you go in for a white button down, black peep toes, or a dress for a wedding you'll surly find something."
3651	0	a	They have a lot of nice stuff, but the pickings of certain things to my liking DONT heavily exist. They do have a vast selection of merchandise, so if you look hard enough (1-2 hours) you'll probably find something you like. I'll give this store a try again sometime next year when the seasons and merchandise change.
3652	1	a	The only Nordstrom Rack I've ever been in until now was in NE Philly, and it's been years.  I popped in to this new one and was delighted.  Not that I found so much to buy, because I'm not a huge shopper.  But happiness is in the hunt, and I did find a few things worthy of my Master Card.  \n\nThat was a week ago.  Since then I've been back twice, first to return something I decided wasn't for me, buying a couple of other things in the process, and then again tonight, to exchange something for a different size (and they did have it!).  That was a quick visit.  So quick, in fact, that in the space of 10 seconds I managed to find two other things to buy!  One was a nightshirt - my favorite thing to sleep in that's usually hard to find in a woven cotton.  They didn't have it in my size on my visit of a few nights ago, but this time there were - TA-DAH - three of them on the rack.  Also a pair of fleece lounging pants with tight cuffs, a necessity for peewee me.  No tailoring or roll-up necessary.  All this just going from the wall rack where my item for exchange was hanging to the register.  It was kinda like Supermarket Sweeps.\n\nI wasn't looking for anything in particular each time I went to the store.  So it has been a learning experience:  this is a place that needs to be visited often, because you never know what you're going to find that you didn't know you needed but can't live without.  So go already!
3653	1	a	So impressed with their work! My carpets have never been so clean. They are so professional and work with my busy schedule. I highly recommend their services and will continue to use them in the future.
3654	0	a	Stopped in here for lunch bc it's right around the corner from my work and I was really looking forward to it. The waitress was very nice. I asked what the chicken steak consisted of bc I don't like deep fried/heavy things for lunch. Turns out it's just seasoned chicken so that's what I ordered. The pita itself was good, the chicken wasn't seasoned evenly. The first couple bites I could taste some of the seasoning and after that it was really bland same thing with the tzatziki sauce. I was very disappointed. I could have paid the same amount, been even closer to work AND had an amazing lunch if I had just went to Cafe Mix.
3655	1	a	I love this place the food is always great and super fresh. I think what differentiates this place from the others is their pita bread is so fresh it's almost crispy.  The customer service is awesome as well I will definitely go back.
3656	1	a	You know about their food truck? No? You're missing out and so was I. \n\nLet's just say that their Lomito Complete sandwich was orgasmic enough for me to scarf down the entire sandwich. Accompanied with a mint lemonade and Mexican corn, well, that was delicious. I'm waiting for the line to be out the door on this small shop.
3657	1	a	I walked in today right when they opened. I was famished. I had not eaten breakfast so I went for the vegetariano. The egg was cooked perfectly over medium and the combination of chimichurri and roasted peppers were bursting with flavor. Glad I happened upon this Bloomfield gem!
3658	1	a	The Lomito Completo was magnificent \n\nMessy goodness with every bite.  One of the best sandwiches I've had
3659	1	a	Had a great time at this hookah bar with a group of friends. Love the atmosphere and great flavors. I'd recommend checking it out!
3660	1	a	Winco has two other locations in the east valley and this one is my favorite so far.\n\nI went there today for their grand opening and was very happy to see their store was clean and well stocked. They sent a mailer with coupons for free cake, brownie and frosting mix and they had plenty of those left around 4:30 pm!\n\nI love shopping their bulk foods section, you can always find those rare items for great prices.\nHaving Winco so close by is great, now I can get all my groceries and don't have to make the long drive to San Tan area or east Mesa.\nJust like at other Winco stores you will have to bag your own groceries, but it's worth it for the prices!
3661	0	a	"Add to the list of \""what makes winco different \"" that they don't take credit cards. Unfortunately they don't make this abundantly clear in the store. Hopefully you'll read this review before you embarrass yourself in the store in front of a line of shoppers like me. Humiliated. 1st visit. Last visit."
3662	0	a	No credit cards here.  Be prepared for some embarrassment. The address is wrong here. It's in gilbert not chandler
3663	0	a	2 stars for the prices only\nWinco clientele, based on my visit:\nFat people on scooters\nPeople with no teeth or missing front teeth\nPeople with no manners\nPeople with lots of kids\nPeople with very little money\nPeople using EBT cards like crazy\n\nI will try again, but not sure it is worth the trip for lower prices based on the experience.
3664	1	a	I found out about Elba from Groupon, and it has become one of the most fortunate Groupon finds ever! Her salon is worth the travel from the Strip because her world class service and prices are a jackpot for sure (cheeseeeeey). On Halloween, I got a blow out and wax from Elba. Her genuine and fun nature feels like you are hanging out with a long time friend, plus you're getting awesome beauty results. She is a talent!!!!! Go see her for everything!! I wish I needed a haircut/highlights at the time because I definitely would have gotten them too!
3665	1	a	I WISH THERE WAS MORE THAN A 5 STAR I COULD GIVE ELBA!\n\nI  recently moved to Vegas from Miami and been dying to get a keratin done. Ever since I have moved I have not found the right salon or pricing till now. I was able to purchase a Groupon for $68. SUPER AFORDABLE! Elba was an amazing stylist she catered to my every hair need. to think my hair is probably beyond damaged! (PINK AND PURPLE AIR SHORT BROKEN CURLY) but she was able to pretty much do a miracle! As well to say I'm a picky person with my hair not everyone can touch it. \n\nWhen I called to make an appointment she listened to my every need and question. As soon as we walked into the salon I felt like I was back home. Holiday music playing Christmas tree up for the holidays (ITS PURPLE MY FAVORITE COLOR). Once again this place is beyond amazing Funny Talented and I recommend everyone in the city of Las Vegas to go and try her out! \n\nWE WILL BE BACK!
3666	0	a	This place should rename themselves to Hello Beijing or Hello China. This is not a typical Japanese restaurant. Their entrees are definitely prepared in Chinese cooking style and rolls taste way different then what you expect. Vegetables are cooked with oil and soy sauce and garlic. They taste like grilled vegetables from Chinese restaurant.  Also, Make sure you read what is in there. Ex) Crunch roll has cream cheese instead of shrimp tempura. \nEntrees are a bit pricy and you will feel like this food taste like the first Chinese plate you ever made.
3667	1	a	Best eel nigiri I've had in Las Vegas. Also had an excellent spider roll. My husband had the chicken Katsu that he really liked. The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is that the woman's restroom had no toilet paper at the time and they had not posted their grade  yet. Won't be back again until the grade is posted, but the food was very good!! I suggest everyone try it.
3668	0	a	I'm really upset about my experience here. I went last night around 6pm now I'm writing a review at 5am because this is still on my mind. I walked in and was greeted by a man who was on the phone. I ordered crab rangoon and chicken teriyaki. The crab rangoon was terrible, it was so salty and it was not creamy like a rangoon is suppose to be, honestly I thought the cream cheese they used was expired. So I tossed the entire appetizer after one bite then moved on to the chicken teriyaki. Depressing, completely bland no teriyaki flavor at all so I also tossed that into the trash. I use to be a cook and their food quality is 1/10. Don't waste your time or money I see this place closing doors like the previous restaurant.
3669	1	a	By far one of the best massage experiences I've ever had.  Panorama Towers is great in and of itself, but Tina's professionalism and expertise was outstanding.  I am a performer with Cirque du Soleil and have gotten a multitude of massages over the years.  Tina's medical training is evident.  She knew exactly how to pinpoint specific problem areas as well as give a complete overall relaxing massage.  \nIf you are looking for someone who knows their craft and is positive, peaceful, and priced fairly, look no further!
3670	1	a	Best Massage I've had in years!!!  Tina is the best kept secret in town. If you're staying near City Center or live in Panorama you must have her on speed dial!
3671	1	a	Tina is awesome! She has been consistently great with my deep tissue massages. She provides a relaxing atmosphere which is appreciated and works well with last minute scheduling. I have referred her to many of my friends and family and they all have loved her!!!
3672	1	a	Best Wine burger and regular burgers in Phoenix. It is a new place that we hope succeeds! Our son loves the hot dog and the waffle fries are incredible! Delicious, high quality food, reasonable prices and the nicest owner. Great ingredients for a successful business! It is a must have!
3673	0	a	Food was okay, but kinda plain. Wasn't sure if there was seasoning on the burger or not. The cashier also said we had to use all of the $40 on one visit, which it does not say on the groupon, so beware
3674	0	a	I had a Yelp Deal so I invited a friend & her 2 kids, thinking $50 would be plenty for hamburgers and fries for our group of 7.  Our bill came to almost $100, that's almost $15 per person!! Now, the owners were extremely accommodating and the food was good overall, locally sourced,  made special, no nitrates,  etc, but we probably we won't be returning based on the price point alone. Might be good for a date night, but not large group.
3675	1	a	Jake and his team are the epitome of professionalism. Their knowledge of the Mortgage Industry helps them bring any transaction to fruition no matter the size.\n\nMy team has worked closely with the Krabbe Team and we look forward to continue helping them grow.
3676	1	a	Jake was extremely friendly and knowledgeable about the entire re-finance process.  He made everything go quickly and smoothly. He was very detailed and kept in contact with me the entire time, even when I had silly questions.  I would recommend him and his team to anyone I know.  Truly the least painful experience I have ever had.
3677	0	a	Very slow service, they're so disorganized with the food line. The nachos were cold, soggy, and chewy by the time I actually got to taste them.
3678	0	a	Having eaten at Moe's several times before across the east coast, my wife and I were very excited to see a new location opening up in Summerlin. We had very high expectations and sadly those expectations were not met. The portion sizes were smaller than they used to be and the prices were not worth the meal that we received.\n\nBesides the food, the staff for the most part seemed very miserable. Some had very bad attitudes while others had no idea what was going on around them. The restaurant was not very busy at the time, so there is no excuse for being miserable. \n\nThe cleanliness of the restaurant left something to be desired. While there was one employee sweeping the floor, there were tables that we dirty and the garbage was overflowing.\n\nOverall the experience was very disappointed. We may attempt dining there again in a few months once they figure out their way.
3679	0	a	I've always wanted to try Moe's! Grand opening was great especially since all the big wigs were there! The next time I went the steak was dried out, the food was not consistent and what really ticks me off is that they measure every little piece of food in my burrito yet it comes with guac yet I barely got any. The staff doesn't seem to know what is going on and most of the food was either over cooked or under cooked such as the rice for my burrito. I really wanted to like this place but I guess growing up in LA and used to REAL Mexican food, this place is too American for me and the lack of flavors or creativity leaves a lot to desire! Zabba's is a lot better and in downtown Summerlin.
3680	0	a	Showed up on a friday night 12/5/14.  This is my third time here.  The staff is still disorganized.  5 people working and only one is making the food on the line.  The food becomes cold by the time you check out because they are so friendly, but slow..\n\nThey ran out of chicken when it was my turn to order.  So I waited patiently.  They said they would bring my order out. They served me the wrong order.   and forget my side of guac.  The manager asked if I would like anything for my troubles, so I asked for another small guac and maybe some queso.  She never came back out to the table.  I finished my meal.  Tried to throw away my trash but they removed the trash can for emptying.  I think Zabbas in the same mall is run more efficiently and a better bet.
3681	1	a	Fresh ingredients and friendly staff! Definitely would recommend and re order the steak burrito bowl!
3682	1	a	I LOVE THIS SHOP! Filled top to bottom with everything and anything you need from cookware to kitchen decor. I bought a few coffee mugs today from Modern Mug, they are so beautiful. Sur La Table also provides cooking classes almost every day. I signed up today for the Sushi cooking class next month, I am so excited! If you get the chance check out this hidden gem.
3683	1	a	I always like browsing at Sur La Table.  I missed the store so much when they moved out of the Miracle Mile Shops and went to the Fashion Show Mall where I rarely go.  With the opening of this store in Downtown Summerlin, it's a short distance to go.\n\nI went in yesterday looking for a particular spice in a grinder but it was something they didn't have on the shelf.  A staff member helped me look but to no avail.  He was very pleasant and stopped what he was doing to lend a hand in helping get what I needed.\n\nThis store is compact.  There is a lot of merchandise in a relatively small space.  Cooking classes are offered in an adjoining room.
3684	0	a	I don't like this one much because when I asked them a question regarding their Sur La Table brand products, they weren't able to answer and weren't sincere to find an answer for me. Whenever I went there, I always saw the staff idling with each other chit chatting with each other, didn't really bother to ask what I was looking for. They just seemed pretty lazy to me, while the other one in town is more hard working than this store. You can see the review I wrote for the other store. The other one is way way way better.\n\nOne star for the staff in this store, the second star is a merciful star for Sur La Table itself.
3685	1	a	The Market is amazing I was already in love but now I'm over the moon in love. Went in today for my daily Kombucha ($3.69, can't beat the price) and while there recommended to the Manager it would be great if they carried Vegas Allergy Mix (holistic amazing remedy for seasonal allergies) she said she would work on it. 30 mins later I get a post on my FB page that she just got off the phone with them and they will have it in a few weeks. HOLY COW... Thanks for blowing my mind! Happy Dance... Happy Dance!
3686	0	a	"This establishment is very obviously ill-equipped for a lunch crowd larger than five people. The ticketing system for the deli is essentially non-existent, creating unbelievable mis-management and disorganization. The cashier would deliver people's orders while there was a long line of people waiting to order and pay; the people supposedly making the food were obviously just wondering around behind the counter, completely lost on how to prepare something from their maximum eight-item menu. \n\nThe real kicker was that I ordered a $7 grilled cheese sandwich that I waited 15 minutes for (I decided to give them the benefit of the doubt since there was a \""rush\"") before going back up to the counter to check on it. They completely forgot about my order, but informed me that  they \""just put it in the oven\"" and it would be another 15 minutes. At this point I had spent 25 minutes in this grocery store, with 10 minutes in line just to order, and asked for a refund. They, for some reason, could not process a refund back to my debit card, and therefore had to give me cash. At this point the manager had stepped in to finish the transaction, but was so detached from the situation that he didn't even ask if there was a problem, just handed me cash and moved on with his day. \n\nWhile I wasn't able to actually get my deli food and review it, some of my coworkers actually received theirs, and felt it was mediocre at best. One of their sandwiches was even missing one of the main ingredients (avocado), and the other's food came cold. On a higher note, one of my coworkers really enjoys their mini pecan pies , so there's that.\n\nIt's really unfortunate that this is the only grocery store downtown. Hopefully they get it together in the next few months. If not, you're much better off at the ever-wonderful Sprouts, or if you're ok with spending The Market prices, your money is much better spent at Whole Foods."
3687	0	a	We just moved to downtown Vegas and were thrilled that the Market's opening would beautifully coordinate with our arrival.  That enthusiasm didn't last long.  1) the selection is extremely limited. Very few fresh veggies and nothing organic.  No dark roast coffee.  We wanted to support local and figured it would take a little time for the Market to get adjusted to the locals and our needs.  So we tried again, but then the real kicker, 2) the service is terrible!  My husband, (who is 48 with a full head of mostly gray hair), went in to buy beer yesterday.  They carded him which I find surprising, but then they would not accept his CT drivers license that the the NV DMV punched because his new NV license is scheduled to arrive within 5-7 days.  Really?!?
3688	0	a	Every day it becomes worse and worse. No fresh vegetables, no organic eggs. The Market is turning slowly into Walgreens that is right around the corner.
3689	0	a	So I gave 2 stars because it's a cool concepts they lost one star by not greeting or giving any direction I was lost and confused on when I got to the salad bars , 1 star lost because the salad is horrible tasting I think it's the meat , out was the buffalo chicken , I think it would taste better if it was plain , another is the lady walking around measuring , did not excuse her self , no one even said hi to me or even acknowledge that I was there , this is a market and in a market there is personality and this place lacked it !
3690	1	a	"Hanging out in Vegas is only expensive if you do it wrong- classic symptoms of \""doing it wrong\"" include:\n1. Booking a hotel on the Strip\n2. Paying for well drinks in a casino\n3. Only eating at sit-down restaurants\n4. Paying for parking. I've made seeking out free parking a game, and it's wonderful how much money you save/ few more miles of exercise you get per week! \n\nThe Market helps out with Numbah 3, and it does it well. The price for the per-pound salad and prepared food bar was 7.99 when I visited, fresh fruit was perfectly ripe, and the customer service was wonderful. They could improve their produce selection- no limes or lemons for hacking into serviceable wedges with whatever blunt instrument one finds in the hotel room. I liked the mini pecan tart, but their cannoli filling was not so great.  \n\nWill definitely come back next time I'm in the neighborhood!"
3691	1	a	Pretty cool market that recently opened up just before you enter The Container Park in downtown Las Vegas. It reminds me of a miniature version of Whole Foods with similar price points.\n\nThey have interesting snacks if you ever get the munchies. Lots of brands I have never seen before. Original and innovative? Perhaps. \n\nThere's also a mini hot & cold foods bar with a cafe like atmosphere that also has a pastry case & fresh baked bread as well. A trendy looking mini-market that's worth a look around.
3692	1	a	I ate at the restaurant on Sunday at 8pm this week.  Here's what I found:\n\nPrice  - The price was perfect, not too expensive like everything else in the Shope's, but not too cheap that the food quality suffered.  It was just right!\n\nFood - The Mexican was premium home-made quality.  I enjoyed everything from the home-made guac to the soup (not too heavy, not too light) that the server reccomended.\n\nService - My server Alex (with glasses) was friendly, engaging, and had dead-on reccomendations.  He was prompt when I needed service, and left me alone when I wanted to eat and focus.   5 star service, really!\n\nEnvironment - Just right for a Mexican place in a casino.  I felt comfortable in my jeans and dress shirt, drinking a beer, while people at the next table were dressed finer then I was.\n\nBottom line - have a meal there when you're in Vegas, it's just the right place for lunch or an early dinner!
3693	1	a	Great atmosphere, great talent behind the bar, excellent food!  Treavor and Jon are bartenders that rock!!!
3694	0	a	First this place is beautifully put together. I love the lay out better than Mandalay. But the was about the best I can do on compliments . \n\nService was mediocre at best. I didn't set the bar too high because I seen the spotty glasses and silverware.  Not a good sign when you walk in to a place. Hostesses seemed lost and we're more concerned with gossip than helping. We didn't expect for four star service but we did expect our server to see how we were on our cold food. But alas no one came by. I did flagged down a manager and notified them my food wasn't hot and he took it away but by this time my friends was cold as well, since she was polite and was waiting so we could eat together. After receiving our food hot, we never seen Hyde nor hare of our server or manager. Enough said. \n\nFood... well again a good attempt at trying. Not really mexican more tex mex, but it had always been that style. Guacamole was ok. Lacked salt and acid. The shorty enchiladas were ok, but too much sauce made the tortilla mushy. Rice was hard like it was in a steam table for hours. Beans were dry and not a lot of flavor either. \n\nOverall...maybe they are just getting their footing and I will be back in the near future to try again. I do miss the old border. Much more intimate with the chef and staff , but hinges do change. Hopefully it can get back to what BG was years ago.
3695	1	a	I went here randomly last night for my birthday dinner as It was the closest to us and we wanted Mexican. Good food. I am vegetarian so they gave us good options. I'd only expect it to have more flavor as it was a little bland.
3696	1	a	Simply awesome. A little bit off the beaten path inside Caesars, but well worth the extra walk. We liked the place so much we went back the next night!\n\nEverything is great from start (the chips and dips) to finish (the exotic ice cream flavors). Appetizers come in generous portions. And the ceviches have a healthy assortment of fresh veggies.\n\nI also have to echo another post here which praised the GM. She's keeping close watch to make sure everything is top notch.\n\nSo stop debating whether or not to go. Just do it! You'll be glad you did.
3697	1	a	Food is excellent, location is a little weird. Feels like you are eating in a mall because basically you are. If you are deciding if to go to the ceasers location or the Mandalay bay one go to the Mandalay Bay, only because it feels more like a nice restaurant.
3698	1	a	Last night, I took my parents to the Border Grill and it was an amazing dining experience.  All the food at the restaurant is prepared fresh, and you can taste the difference. We had the Yucatan pork the chili relleno and the short rib enchiladas. These are all excellent dishes. The chili relleno was the best I've ever tasted.  The Yucatan pork, of course, is a staple at the Border Grill, and it was excellent last night. The sweet corn tamales from the appetizer menu are beyond delicious. The server was friendly, engaged and attentive.  I highly recommend this place.

3700	1	a	This is a really great walk-in nail salon, located next to Macy's in Downtown Summerlin. My mom was in town this weekend so we wanted to check out this new mall and decided to stop in and get mani pedi's. Very friendly and talented guys there, they did a great job. Only reason I am not giving 5 stars is because we ended up waiting a bit long, and our services were out of sync so I was complete done when my mom was just starting her manicure. But that's because they were getting a lot of walk-ins all day. Otherwise, fun experience.
3701	0	a	I will NEVER go here again. I was charged $50 for a fill! Not a new set, just a fill. Absolutely ridiculous. The job she did was decent but definitely not $50 worth! You can get better service for less elsewhere.
3702	0	a	"So, I gave it one star for convenience. Because if you live nearby...well, it's close. \n\nAnd a second star because the place has tv's and giant pedicure massage chairs, so if you could go in just to use those...football was on both tv's (??) and the chairs massage well. \n\nHowever, though I wanted to expect more, there isn't much else. \n\nWe came here one weekend because (silly me) didn't call my usual salon in time to get my usual girl. So I decided that since I needed my nails done, I'd give the \""closer\"" more \""convenient\"" place a try. \n\nThe staff is pretty unorganized...and while they have 15 or so stations, when I went on a Saturday there were only 3 employees. Meaning the same ones doing your nails are answering the phone, talking to walk-ins, etc. \n\nAlso, I'm not sexist by any means...but two of the employees are men...who quite frankly, don't have a \""creative side\"" (so to speak).  When I get my nails done, I like to hear about new colors, look at the cute nails on the employees or look at the design wheel. No, none of that. I don't know anything about the female employee as she didn't do our pedi or gel mani's. \n\nThe men were quite \""rugged\"", very nice....but you know, the guys at Home Depot are nice too. I just didn't feel like i was being pampered or relaxed like I feel at my usual nail salon.  \n\nSo anyways, I fancy myself a \""connoisseur\"" of nails. Jk. But really though, I get my nails done religiously every 2-3 weeks. My pedi was a little half-hearted...I usually love when a man does my pedis because they usually scrub a little harder and I get super softness on my feet. NOT THIS TIME!!  It was like \""*wipe/wipe* ok done with that.\""  I though to myself, \""really, that's it?\""  Maybe it was because he had the cordless phone strapped on his waistband and had to answer calls....and also talk to the people who walked in. *ugh*.  I was already done with the whole thing....as in, I didn't care. Just paint me up and let me go. \n\nI will say, the paint job on my pedi was good. \n\nOn to the mani. So, the place has a beautiful kind of oval shaped \""nail bar\"" in the center. Looked comfy from my pedi chair. It's quite large, I imagine they had about 12 stations at the oval nail bar. ...but I got to sit elsewhere, at one of two tiny stations jammed in the corner of the shop. Strange since only one person (the woman) was working in the center...on one client. Anyways, I sat with my arm touching the wall and my chair pressed against another chair that was pressed into the other station behind me...wasn't great. Felt a little tight...but again, I was over the whole thing.  JUST LET ME LEAVE ALREADY!! Are we done yet?? \n\nI asked for a pretty simple design....black with white dots.  Wow. What was I thinking??\n\nThe black went on fine. But the white dots...oye!!!  You know how gel can sometimes be really thick? So when he placed a dot, the little string of white gel polish that followed from my nail to the tool would just fall....so my dots looked like little tadpoles. NEARLY ALL OF THEM. I thought, \""oh...he will go back and clean that up before I go \""baking\"" but NO SIR-ee. He told me to bake just like that. I said, \""oh, can you clean those tails off?\"" And after asking 5x without him really comprehending what I was saying...I gave up. I baked those tadpoles just as they were...tails and all!!!\n\n\n\nAnyways, in summary...I had high hopes. A place across the freeway from me sounded great...but only in theory.  The place wasn't relaxing and most importantly, the services were not good for me. \n\nI now make sure to always have my next 2 appointments booked with my regular girl so that I never inadvertently fall off of her busy schedule."
3703	0	a	"This is a HORRIBLE company. My mother is disabled and they took advantage of her. Our water leveler was broken and flooding our backyard for 2 months and supposedly had no idea it was the pool. Even though their website states that they check all parts before leaving. Don't understand how they could miss it shooting 1/2 a gallon of water per minute. (we found that out from our water company) I contacted BBB and all they offered was a month refund of pool services. Didn't even offer to pay for the damages in our backyard. We had a new guy come and he could not believe the damages it caused and how they \""didn't know\"". This company is terrible with no morals at all. DO NOT USE THEM"
3704	0	a	"If I could give this company ZERO stars I would. As part of our lease agreement with a prominent rental company in the Phoenix area, our pool maintenance WAS contracted through Johnson Pools. All I can say is thankfully enough people have complained that they decided to switch vendors (yes I did a happy dance!). We went through three different pool guys in 6 weeks (they all kept quitting!) and due to \""no shows\"" our pool eventually developed black algae then turned green. I could go on and on. I complained a few times but they just LIE! This company is beyond awful. I'd be surprised if they are still in business in another 6 months, because they obviously don't care."
3705	0	a	"Worst business and owner we've EVER experienced! We had a tech come look at our heater. He opened the cover, moved some valves and turned the heater on. The heater ended up working at the time so he left. \nJohnson Pools sent 2 bills to our house for $85 dollars. I called both times and they said if we didn't hear back from them it was taken care of. A few months later we received a bill that says if we don't pay we'll be taken to collections. \n\nMy husband called to discuss the bill and the owner THREATENED to come to our house and ASSAULT my husband in front of me!!! He screamed and yelled on the phone after my husband said we didn't agree with the amount they were charging us. \n\nThe tech and office staff lied saying they tried to contact us \""multiple times\"" to discuss the bill. We never had any missed calls or voicemails from Johnson Pools. \n\nDON'T call or contact them!"
3706	1	a	Came on a Friday night and it turns out it was only the second night open. Service was great. \n\nGot the crispy cheese curds which were delicious. Highly recommended. Definitely a highlight. \n\nFor the main course we got a Margherita pizza and the fat boy pizza. Margherita, while intended to be a simple pie, was a little too simple and borderline bland. \n\nThe Fat Boy Pizza on the other hand was very flavorful. The pickled peppers had us a little worried at first but it turned out to be the ingredient that made it so tasty!\n\nEnded with the swirl soft serve to go with lucky charms. Great treat to end dinner with. \n\nI'd definitely come back for the handcrafted thin pizza!
3707	1	a	Union at the Biltmore has itself a winning combination now that Forge Pizza is open!    The restaurant sports an industrial yet cozy steel and burnt wood design, 100% wood-fired oven that serves as a focal point, a sprawling patio, and impressive bar menu.  Check out the Baby Octopus, Mushroom Pizza, and a craft beer from their meticulously procured list.
3708	1	a	Amazing service!!  Ask for Chloe, she is the best server in town. The food was great...you have to order the cheese cheese curds.
3709	1	a	Their pizza is on par with the best pizza restaurants in town.  I will be adding them to the rotation.
3710	0	a	Terrible! Do not waste your time or your money. I'm giving it 2 stars because the server was outstanding and the drinks were fine. But the chicken salad came with deep fried, breaded chicken! Really? In this day and age? They offered to change it, and this time the salad was served with a thin, sorry piece of bland, tasteless chicken thigh! The greens were limp, and unimaginative, with three tiny blobs of feta. \nFor a place that serves pretty much salad, pizza and burgers- this was pathetic. BTW, do not bother with the Brussels sprouts: they are deep fried too! The baby octopus must've been a preemie- that's how tiny the portion size was! Their signature ice cream with olive oil and salt was served in a plastic cup with a plastic spoon, and that was a major disappointment as well. Their location is great, is why they have customers, but their kitchen better get their act together because the Biltmore area is not lacking for decent places to eat!
3711	0	a	Burned pizza, tasted like smoke, literally.  The worst pizza I have ever had.  I took it back and was told it was perfectly cooked.  Not to your customer it wasnt.  A full refund would have been appropriate. It was charred black on the bottom.  Customer service should have prevailed but no go at FORGE.  16.00 for a pizza that was barely edible.
3712	0	a	we sat on the patio for 10 minutes and no came by and attempted to take our order or acknowledge us.
3713	1	a	"Busy day at the hospital and I needed a drink.  One of the nurses had recommended a new barstaurant that had just opened in the district by GVR.\nTypically this area is aimed for the older demographic but when me and a friend had arrived it was sporting a new crowd.\n\nThe bar is the same area as Al's Garage in that alley by Lucille's.  The restaurant has not had it's grand opening yet but is currently having their soft opening.\n\nUpon arriving to the restaurant you're not greeted by a host/hostess but you simply seat yourself.  Soon after the manager (Brian) who also operates Common wealth and Park on Fremont had greeted us and was very accommodating.  \n\nSoon after our waitress (Sierra) had a arrived and took our drink orders.\n\nSetting: Very modern, english interior.  You feel like you're inside of an exclusive bar because of the dark decor and fancy decorations.  \n\nDrinks:  Madame Victorian arguably one of the best drinks i have ever had (and i've had a few drinks in my lifetime). Nice fruitiness with such an excellent subtle tone of alcohol.  My friend had got the \""When the Smoke settles\"" which was amazingly chocolately and very smooth.  I had two other drinks which were okay.\n\nFood:  I got the burger which was amazing.  The meat was oozing with juices and very tender.  My friend got the fried chicken sliders which were just as tasty.\n\nService:  Friendly management, Our server and busser were always around just in case we needed anything.\n\nOverall: Finally a cool place for the younger crowd to hang out at in Henderson which is pretty hard to find.  No more having to drive all the way down to fremont to enjoy a nice drink with friends.  I would definitely come check this place out."
3714	0	a	The food menu is very limited. The service is extremely slow. For place that had a month long pre opening, they are not providing good service at all. Waitress was forgetting parts of the order. Not a place to come back to anytime soon. Serious improvements are needed.
3715	0	a	I sat down with my boyfriend at one of the booths for approximately 20 minutes before he headed over to the bar to get someone to serve us. When she finally came over to bring the cocktail list as he asked, she didn't even bother to greet us or ask if it was our first time there. \n\nI ordered some blueberry drink and my boyfriend picked out a chocolate drink. Both were disgusting. The waitress never came around to ask us what we thought of our drinks. I had to flag her down so she could bring me my check and even then, she just didn't care to ask why we were cashing out immediately after getting our first drink. \n\nBoth my boyfriend and I were excited about what seemed like a promising bar with some cool decor and art in Henderson. Now we don't ever expect to come back here.
3716	1	a	i'm seriously shocked by all the negative reviews of this place.  i stumbled across this gem and fell in love!  FINALLY green valley has a bar that rivals those downtown!!  the service i received was excellent, our waitress came by often to check on us and was very helpful suggesting her favorites from the menu.  \n\ni love the decor, it is completely changed from als garage, thank jesus.  anyone complaining about this change blows my mind as the last few times i went to als it was dead, even the bartenders gave the impression that they didn't want to be there.  \n\nthis bar is absolutely amazing!  whist (next door) is fabulous too.  you have to check it out!
3717	1	a	A unique place for the district. Has an upscale feel on one side but still has tv screens showing sports behind the bar which takes away a little from the ambiance. Menu is small but food is good. Drink selection is decent. Music is too loud to have much of a conversation and the service isn't terribly fast. If you are interested in a leisurely night of a few drinks and a few snacks where you don't won't to talk much then this is the perfect place for you.
3718	0	a	"My friend and I arrived at almost 8pm on a Friday night. All of the regular seating was full, but there were seats at the bar so we chose those. The first bartender who greeted us was great, happy and helpful but maybe almost a little too intense. However, I would rather have had him all night than the miserable bartender who took over for him. \n\nWe ordered the Madame Victoria (blueberry cocktail) and the first bartender told me it was a very popular seller. When we got them, we were less than thrilled. It was like it was too sweet, but too tangy at the same time, very strange. I'm not one for re-ordering so I sucked it down and that was that. My friend however couldn't bring herself to finish hers, therefore left her glass over half empty. She ordered another drink instead, and when he finally took her blueberry nonsense away, he said \""no refunds\"" and dumped the drink into the trash. How about, \""I'm so sorry you didn't like it, let me make you something else\"" or, knowing that I am drinking the same cocktail, dump it in my glass instead of the trash can. \n\nI had ordered the Pretzel Sticks, with cheese fondue which were good, but nothing I can't live without or make myself. We were enjoying those, when another friend joined us. She ordered a burger which she seemed to enjoy, and I tried a french fry which was pretty delicious. We decided we needed some more pretzels to share, but the bartender (semi-jokingly) said that I had gotten the last order. First, they are pretzels, second, it is pretty early on a Friday night, third, I would imagine they are a pretty popular menu item, so running out seemed like a joke to me. Not to mention, if you are out of something, how about you ask us if we want to try something else? So literally, we took this comment as a joke.  When a half an hour later rolled around and we still had no pretzels, we realized he was being serious.\n\nNow it's time to pay. Our order wasn't too complicated, so you would think splitting checks wouldn't be too complicated either. You know what we ordered, we want to put it on our own credit cards, just take care of it. One of the girls explained this to him, but instead, he took the check back that he had already presented and said \""Ok then let me just split the check\"". He returned with three separate checks and of course we were already handing over our money so we could leave. I paid cash, but they must not believe in cents at this establishment because I did not receive mine. Please Sir, keep the $0.43 cents.\n\nOverall: Decor is really cute, trendy, love the chandeliers and the space itself (which is the only reason I gave a second star). Menu is pretty limited both food and cocktail/beer/wine, they could definitely do better especially with the drinks. There were a couple of things I was debating between on the food menu, but nothing looked like I needed to go back for and couldn't get somewhere else. I expect FAR more from a place that is associated with Commonwealth and Blvd. Cocktail Company. Frankly I was disgusted with the service and couldn't get out of there fast enough."
3719	0	a	Not impressed- Very dark, slow service and food was and menu not worth returning for.  The wings were dry, the nachos were blah.  I miss al's.
3720	0	a	8$ for freaking Stella Artois? 18$ for a flank steak of a few ounces and some frozen waffle fries? Oh wait it gets better, in the middle of the eating our server presents the check, we didn't get why since we wanted to stay more and grab a few more beers so we had to tell her to take it back. Anyway never again, rip off!
3721	0	a	Food is great, but very small menu! Extremely overpriced beer and wine.  Also very unfortunate to pay so much ($6 for a coors light) to then go to the women's restroom to find no toilet paper and trash on the floor.  We come to the district to get off the strip, but the prices won't bring me back.
3722	1	a	The pretzels were amazing!!\n\nSome of the seats are first-come-first-serve and I was lucky that I was with party that got there early.  Sit-down service was mediocre, but when I ordered from the bar the bartenders were friendly.  The ambiance reminds me of a higher-end version of the Artisan.  \n\nI had fun and am looking forward to the next time I go!
3723	1	a	I love this spot! We had the grape fruit beer and fell in love. I could have spent the whole night in here catching up with friends!
3724	0	a	"Here on NYE.  Paid $200 plus tax & tip for a $4.99 bottle of disgusting \""not even real\"" champagne. For $200 they could have springed for at least a $10 bottle of Korbel.  Disappointed"
3725	1	a	We have become fans of Five Guys Burgers.  Tonight, I got a cheeseburger and fries for my wife because I was going to the Strip for dinner.  I ordered online for the first time because this new outlet is so close to my house.\n\nI left a bit early and it was good.  Downtown Summerlin is still going through the opening weekend and the number of cars trying to get in was huge.  I was forced by Metro to drive around.  I wanted to give him a finger salute but I thought better of it!\n\nIt was worth the extra time.  I arrived at Five Guys at the time I had said I would pick up the burger and they were just finishing up.  The place was slammed and there must have been 12 employees behind the counter.  Even with all the people in the restaurant, there was no line and the employees were efficient and knew what they were doing.  There must have been some good pre-opening training!!\n\nMy wife reports that everything was very good.  I'm sure we'll be there more often as things quiet down a bit.\n\nWelcome to the neighborhood, Five Guys!
3726	0	a	I went on a Wednesday during the busy lunch time around 12:30 p.m. Parking sucks. I had to park far. I got the little cheeseburger and an order of fries. It's my second time at this franchise. I was overwhelmed by the menu with the various toppings so got one with everything but mustard. I thought it was pricey for a smaller burger and fries for fast food, almost $9.\n\nI got my to go order. My bag was so oily. I got some grease in my car seat which I later had to wipe off. Gross. I know I'm eating burgers and fries but the greasiness through the bags turned me off. \n\nGreasy, solid burger, & the patties were juicy. Nothing special but not the worst burger either, just your standard burger you can make at home. My fries was a huge serving. I gave half away. I wasn't crazy about the fries.\n\nThis just confirmed I'm on Team In-N-Out.
3727	1	a	Five guys is always excellent for a burger and fries - this location is no exception. The burgers are always juicy and amazing, the fries were fresh and crispy. The service at this location was also friendly and fast, stop here for a quick lunch!
3728	0	a	I'm giving a below average rating due to the service level and being out of a condiment on more than one occasion - NOT for the quality of the food.\n\nI have been to this new Five Guys 5 times in the past 6 weeks.  Twice (last night and again about 2 weeks ago) - they were out of pickles.  How is a hamburger place out of pickles?  Go to the grocery store and grab a few jars so that you at least have some...who cares if they aren't your typical brand you use.   You should not run out of basic condiments and think it's okay.\n\nAdditionally, I've placed two orders for carry out - BOTH times, they have messed up my order.  I got home and all burgers were missing tomatoes (which on the receipt did say to add tomatoes).  The time before that, my to-go order was missing tomatoes and onions...They have a TON of people working there - surely someone can pay attention to what the orders ask for.  I spend $30+ and I expect to get what I ordered.  I should not have to double-check to ensure the toppings are on the burgers.  This is not rocket science.  And one time would be forgivable, but again, it's happened twice in about 3 weeks - so I'm sure it's not just my order.  They need to get it together at this new location.   In the meantime, double-check your orders if you get a carry out.  \n\nOtherwise, SO much better than IN N OUT burgers -- which have the smallest patty of meat that you will ever see.  It's  a joke.  \n\nI do wish Five Guys would offer a turkey burger!
3729	0	a	Went in last night to put a shirt in order.  Special order.  They told me they would take 40 dollars to hold special made shirt.  They took the whole amount.  Went back.  They told me they would void order and money returned to my card.  No luck.  They held funds for total purchase.  Do not trust them with your credit card info on special orders.  They will use it at their liberty.  Bad experience.
3730	1	a	This place is great.. Nice staff. Great drinks.. I will be coming back!
3731	1	a	Adrenaline is much better than the Cheyenne Saloon was. Attentive bar staff, cheap drinks and good lineups being booked always helps. \n\nMy only complaint was the sound, and you could tell a big difference from when the sound guy from the headliner got on the boards and when the house man was running it.
3732	0	a	"The Red Bull race, althought cancelled early due to windy weather would be worth a full 5 stars.  Unfortunately, the venue and Motor Speedway management of the event was subpar.\n\nFour of us purchased Club House seats to the Vegas Red Bull Air Races.  We were all excited that our $350 tickets would provide a pleasant, upscale viewing experience. Not so.  First of all, communication about the tickets was poor.  After several emails back and forth, my husband was told he could pick the tickets up at \""Will Call\"" if he was worried about getting them on time.  Really?  Can you just mail them on time?  \n\nThe website gave very little information about the race schedule, side acts, map of the venue, etc.  The signage at the track was poor.  When we asked for directions, one attendant asked us to see our map and then complained that he could \""hardly read it.\""  He then pointed us in the general direction.  Another attendant said he \""had no idea where Lot 4\"" was located, but then remembered \""Hey, I\""M LOT 4.  ITS RIGHT OVER THERE!!\""  \n\nWe had to pass through security on our way in.  I had an umbrella to use for my walk from the parking lot and was told I had to put it away.  I put it in my purse.  My purse was checked at the next point, and the guard there told me he would have to \""confiscate\"" my umbrella.  I asked him if I could claim it on my way out and he said (flatly), \""Nope, I'll be gone by then.\"" He then pushed it rudely towards my husband and said \""you can can take it to the car or I can confiscate it now.\""  My husband waliked it to the car and had to make his way through the line again.\n\nOnce parked, we made our way to the Club House seats, looking forward to the comfortable, air conditioned view.  Upon entering, we were told our seats were outside in full sun on the 90+ degree day!  We were told we could sit inside the Club House Hospitality Room, which was crowded, standing room only.  In fact, 90% of the race attendees of all ticket types were huddled under the overhang in the only shade to be found.  We were quick enough to nab a table as another group got up to walk around.  The view from the table was obstructed, but better than sitting in full sun.  \n\nThe attendants in the hospitality room were useless.  We were given only two programs when we entered, so I returned to the desk to ask for another only to find out they had run out of copies.  This was at 11:00 a.m. on the first day!  The wifi was not working for anyone in the room.  When I told this to the hospitality desk, the young lady responded, \""Oh, really.  I don't have anything to do about that.\""  \n\nI have no complaints about the food served in the Hospitality Room. Very little for me as a vegetarian, but I expected that at this venue and was ready to purchase food. Unfortunately, there were very few choices available.  The food trucks there were \""carnival\"" type funnel cakes, etc.  \n\nI didn't have any wine, but the member of my party who did said the white wine was pretty bad.  \n\nMy husband was hoping for some jet flyby's or other exciting side acts.  The acrobatic air show (helicopter and plane) were great.  The numerous motorcyle acts were not very interesting and very hard to see.  \n\nBy the second day, we had a strategy to get there super early and find better seats by the window.  We were there 20 minutes before opening and were met with a long line of folks waiting.  The lined moved quickly at the time for opening and the two guys in our group hustled to get good seats.  We were lucky enough to get the last four spaces available by the window.  I'm not sure how so many others got in so quickly. \n\nThe race itself was thrilling, but unfortunately was cancelled early due to windy weather on Day 2."
3733	0	a	Very poor experience.  I attended the Air Races in San Diego a few years ago and since the break in seasons and new regulations, they have become boring.  The planes are too far away and the track has poor orientation.  The orientation does not allow the spectator to fully grasp the maneuverability of the aircraft as they travel through the course; a full one half of the course is very far away and the gates are angled in a way that makes the turns nearly imperceptible.  The stands were nearly empty, the announcer was hard to hear even without the wind, the TV monitors were too small, and there were several long delays between runs.  One positive is that the people in the stands were friendly.
3734	1	a	I've always been VERY cautious about where I get my hair cut and colored. I've had some terrible experiences.\n\nThat being said, I will never go to anyone but Mandy again!\n\nThe atmosphere was soothing and contributed to the overall excellent experience I had. I love the way my hair looks and feels; never damaged, always silky and healthy when I walk away from her chair. She's cut and colored my hair (both deep brown and bright purple) and I couldn't express my satisfaction in its entirety. Best part: my trips to her salon never break my bank!!\n\nStop searching for your new hairstylist; you've found her.
3735	1	a	I am blessed with natural waves and don't need to use a blow dryer or heat stylers.  However, I still need a good haircut that grows out well.  So pleased with the job Chanel did. Kept the volume around the crown as my hair grew out.  My scalp was also very itchy until she recommended I try the Sooth Organics shampoo.  Oh My God. Instant relief.  I don't know what brought on the scalp issue (speculating it was menopause), but I will use nothing else now. I've tried and the itching returns.  The final bonus is she's got a clever sense of humor. Yep, 5 star.
3736	0	a	"Their \""spicy\"" Bison burger has no kick at all, the spicy ketchup at Whataburger has more heat. Only really had cheese, meat and sauce on a bun, nothing else. It's was a very meh burger at a higher price of other really good burger places close by. All the stuff on their menu was overpriced. I'd pass on this place."
3737	1	a	Service was strange. We were told the wait would be 20 minutes even though there were many available tables. When we got our coffees from the bar (as suggested by the waitress that greeted us), we were approached to be seated. A little weird. \n\nWe sat for a while until someone finally came to get our orders. I got the Fat Hen Sandwich and my boyfriend got the Hash. My sandwich was delicious. The meat was so tender. Whatever sauce they used on the bun was a little sweet and it matched perfectly with the brisket. \n\nMy boyfriend was impressed with his hash too. Real hash! None of that canned stuff here. \n\nWe'll definitely come back.
3738	1	a	I really like Tapacubo. It has a nice atmosphere with a large bar in the middle, comfortable booths around the walls, a nice patio on one side and pool on the other (part of the attached Graduate Tempe hotel). \n\nI have been twice now and had the guacamole and chips both times. The guac is delicious and they give an ample amount. The chips are fine, not great but who cares since the guacamole is so good. The chicken street tacos are amazingly good. In fact, they would be perfect were it not for the very average corn tortillas that seem like you could buy in a grocery store. \n\nThere is a small yet decent beer selection, thankfully not just a bunch of Mexican beers. When you get a beer on tap, they are served in plastic cups - kind of weird but priced pretty well so who cares. \n\nIf you don't want tacos, tortas or a few appetizer-like shared plates, this is not the place for you. The menu is quite limited, but that means the food they do offer is done well in this case. I'd recommend it - much better and unique than most hotel restaurants.
3739	0	a	"These people fixed my phone a week ago it falls once and it gets a huge crack on the screen. I go to see what they would do for me seeing as the screen and lcd is not worth the $150 they charged me and all they say is \""you have to pay another $150\"" never again am I going to these people they rip you off and the screen had a dent on it when I go home and see that it really was not worth it. They suck and I would not recommend them. If you have the money to spend then go there. they don't take long getting your phone ready but enjoy getting ripped off if you go."
3740	1	a	Great service!! Came in to get my my iPhone   5 screen fix.. They told me to pick it up the next day and tadaaa it was right there waiting for me to pick up!! They are very professional and welcoming too!! Will definitely come back if needed!!
3741	1	a	I was really stoked to have found this cellphone store not only they offer customize phone cases they also hands down provide the best costumer service! Excellent place to get any of your electronic devices fixed! Amazing and talented, very reliable and efficient. Highly recommended!
3742	1	a	Had my girlfriends iphone 5 screen replaced today which was on Jan 1.  Was surprised to find a place open near my house on the 1st which worked out well.  The screen was replaced and worked great in about 20mins.  The price was a little higher than other stores but being the 1st of January and the fact that my girlfriend needed her phone right away, I was ok with paying a slightly higher price at $89 for the service.  \nTheir service was great and I would recommend this store to anyone in need of phone repairs\n\nJB
3743	1	a	Awesome, Awesome, Awesome! Great wines and always good company. The owners are usually the ones pouring their wines and most of their large family is involved in the business. I love to support local businesses and this is more than just a mom and pop shop!
3744	1	a	Nice new place.  Counter has about 8 seats and looks as if a counter will be put in the window for about 6 more seats.  Had a few people in front of us waiting for there take out orders and a few at the counter.  You order and they then cook your order.   It took 11 minutes from when we ordered. \n\nThe food is good.  Went with the Chicago Dog which was a killer.  Have been craving one for a while since my favorite Dog shop closed last year.  The Mac and Cheese comes with the long spiral noodles and is pretty good.\n\nHas been a while since I have been to the Library location, so will have to return and got one of the build your own burgers.\n\nfacebook;https://www.facebook.com/BurgerzNDogz
3745	0	a	"Darren W. has a degree in Creative Writing from Fantasy Island University, as a result, his reviews on Yelp are useless -so this is the first official/actual review of Burgerz and Dogz in Mt. Lebanon. \n\nFor a burger and a dog, not  a bad place if you like bland non-salted meat.  Salad, not so good.  You will find a much better burger (light years better) down the road at the Galleria (Houlihan's or Mitchell's) and only pay a couple extra bucks for it.  \n\nI recommend the skinless hot dog as the natural casing is too hard to bite through and pushes the toppings on the rest of your dog when you try and bite through it.  (undercooked skin is harder to bite through than crispy skin so all the toppings get pushed to another region of the hotdog when you bite into it).  They use the Vienna brand 100% beef hot dog.  I feel this hotdog is not salty enough and have never liked it, so if you are craving salt in a hotdog, this hotdog is not for you.\n\nThe hamburger, not bad.  I ordered mine medium-well and it was done appropriately.  I ordered mustard, ketchup, onions, and French fries on my burger.  Did not receive the onions (no biggie) but the burger was done good and the rest of the toppings made it very good except, my ketchup was in packets in the to-go bag instead of on my hamburger, not cool!!!  If I were eating my sandwich in a car, I would have been extremely upset when not received the way I ordered it!  Again, the actual meat was bland, no salt.  NOTE: One should not have to \""salt\"" a friggin hamburger from a burger joint!!!  (This seems to be the norm in Mt. Lebanon.  Any restaurant or sub shop in Mt. Lebo is bland because entrepreneurs doing demographic research think that because an area is \""upper-middle\"" class, the people want bland, non-salted \""good-for-you\"" foods.  Read my review of Lebo Subs, right across the street.  Well, I don't go to a freakin burger and dog place to eat healthy!  So in reality, the burger was bad because they missed 2 of my toppings (ketchup and onions) and the meat was salt-free.   \n\nI had a salad there last week.  Their Italian dressing is horrible.  The Italian was not creamy but someone's \""oil-and-oil\"" interpretation of Italian -tasting like it was made in someone's basement, hello botulism!  Horrible!  Let's not be creative, just serve Italian dressing!!!  Never again!  (But to be fair, this is a burger and dog place, not a salad place.  They just end up alienating vegetarian family members.)\n\nSo, ok to go to this place if you are fine with bland food.  Just order your hamburgers \""well-done\"" (as the meat is nothing special) and get the \""skinless\"" dogs and forget about the salads.  If you are a person who craves SALT in their junk/fast food, this place is NOT FOR YOU."
3746	1	a	I've been going here almost once a week since they opened and always get the same thing. The Chicago Dog with the natural casing is just about amazing. This hot dog could compete with any in the Windy City and that's probably the case because they use the same Vienna Hot Dogs. \n\nAnother cool thing I discovered this past week is that they are doing 1/2 off mounds of fries every Wednesday, which is a heart attack of fries, nacho cheese, bacon, Mac n cheese and ranch. Throw in an Iron City and it's yinzer heaven.
3747	0	a	"This place recently came to Mt. Leb and it immediately hopped on my \""Eat Here\"" list. I went with my guy after a heavy night of adult beverages and we needed greasy food ASAP. \nForemost, the set-up of the restaurant is awful. We walked in to the store to the grill line and some bar stool seating (no alcohol involved). We tried to order there, but were sent back to the \""dining area.\"" \nOur waitress was young and very slow. She didn't make much of an effort to connect with us or help us order, even though we told her it was our first time there. We ordered chili cheese fries from the menu as an appetizer - of course, they came with our main course. \nTim and I both ordered custom burgers from the Burgatory-esque menu pads. The toppings that were available were extensive specialty items - avocado, smokehouse onion cheddar cheese, season your own burger? Why don't you have seasoned meat, BnDz? Our MTO burgers were tasty, but nothing special...even with the added specialty toppings. They were both over-cooked.\nThe dining clientele itself was very interesting. One woman knocked over her glass of Pepsi and her waitress took a total of 20 minutes to clean it up (with paper towels, no rag or mop). \n\nNothing made sense about this place."
3748	1	a	Excellent service, very clean, great food. Ask for TK to be your server great service. Order the Pork Adobo and Pancit so good. Will definitely try again.
3749	1	a	Service was fast and the bulalo was really good! Bistek Tagalog is always satisfying!
3750	1	a	Great food great service. Best filipino food in vegas. And the filipino employees make you feel at home
3751	0	a	Soooooooo dissaponted just came back from a trip from San Francisco and I was famished. The place was empty except for some employees eating. I ordered dinakdakan I heard so much about it. They did not have it . They tried to make me try another dish but it didn't sound good because I didn't know some of the ingredients.Strike one ! We were there about 25 minutes when I noticed another  waitress giving our order to a table whose occupants came much later than us. Our orders were full orders and these people ordered the lunch special. Much smaller portions. I called our original waitress yes she was eating but she didn't even bother to come. I was already late for an appointment  so I just left money to cover our  drinks and left. If it was really busy I could understand but there were only 2 tables that was being served. I would be really worried if it was much busier. I wouldn't want to be there........ ever.
3752	0	a	worst lunch special ever!!! took 1/2 hour to get my food. all it was rice,boiled egg, tomato and pork.  the pork was cooked with oil, who does that? too much spices on the pork not what i was expecting.    never going back!!!!
3753	1	a	I've been going to Patty for a few years now and her work is top notch. I have strayed away by purchasing groupons closer to me but am always disappointed. I've found that each of my massages are compared to Patty's and because of that, they all are a let down in comparison. Her knowledge about what my body is doing and where the tension is coming from is incredible. The ambiance is relaxing and professional (unlike many of the groupons I've gone to.) Even though I have 'cheated' on her from time to time I always find myself going back.
3754	1	a	Patty is amazing! I've been looking for a well rounded massage therapist that can carry the workload of both relaxing and deep tissue therapy! If you're an athlete and looking for someone to ensure you can give it 100% everyday without fear of injury than Patty will get you there!
3755	0	a	How do you mess up rice? \nSeriously, you're an Asian buffet.\n\nMost of the food was not very good. The one exception being the delicious coconut shrimp \n\nMy spoon was dirty and so were 2 of the plates I picked up.\n\nVery cheap price but you get what you pay for.
3756	1	a	Visited this buffet restaurant three times between December 15 and 22nd 2014, once for dinner and twice lunch. I found their food excellent, lot of choices to pick \nfrom, they brought fresh food in constantly. I don't understand often the negative comments people sometimes have on restaurants that are completely unwarranted in my opinion. Sometimes I wonder if they are objective or just wants to air some grievance and write negative. There are dozens of choices, try to tell me nothing was good at all. About food being cold, no idea when that was because every time I had a problem taking photo's due to the hot steam under the tray to keep the food warm!!    \nI tried the hibachi/grill food too, picked some simple ingredients and the end result was not bad at all. Only thing I don't understand is the jar for tips there.\n\nThe service was excellent whenever my wife and I were there. If the food there was so bad then I wonder why Chinese travel agencies from China end up there with their tourist in busloads!! I have eaten in most of the hotels on the strip for buffet and laying out $30-$60 a person for a buffet, but this restaurant with their prices doesn't have to hold their head down for the quality of their food, so they have no Italian,American or Mexican food, it's Chinese buffet and they compare damn good with the other. I'm not from Las Vegas, I have traveled and eaten all over the world so it's not that I'm not able to compare restaurants, in fact I keep a small special notebook with me where I put the business cards in and write my opinion about service and food. If they have a takeout order sheet I take that too just to compare different restaurants and their prices.I gave them 4 stars and not 5 due to the fact that each restaurant can have an improvement somewhere, somehow, of the hundreds of restaurants that I visited there are maybe a handful that have the 5 stars.\n\nI have to do a correction here, as mentioned everything was fantastic except it seems I have to agree with Travis B. concerning the rice, I did not eat the white rice, eat it every day at home so why should I have it in a restaurant, my wife however had it and she informed me that the rice was sticky and burnt, poor quality of rice.
3757	0	a	I has such high hopes but was sadly disappointed. Even though the price was reasonable I wouldn't  recommend this place. It's in a scary neighborhood. I didn't feel safe. There were cobwebs in my room above the tv. Hair on the toilet and the hair dryer. Cleaning staff obviously didn't check the tissues because I took one and the box was empty. I called front desk and was told come get a box. Didn't offer to bring me one. That totally pisses me off. Stains on the bedspread. Phone wasn't plugged in. When I went to plug it in I found a bunch of chips/crumbs beside the nightstand. I cringed when I saw the crap behind the nightstand. It's never been vacuumed. Hot tub was only warm.\n\nI think you get the picture.
3758	1	a	Had my monthly inventory at work. I ordered 21 burritos. 21 employees satisfied! Everything was awesome !
3759	1	a	We LOVE Bonita's!! Owned by the same wonderful people who own Pullano's, Bonita's is turning into our new favorite place. It's honestly getting hard to choose between Pullano's and Bonita's... but Bonita's wins for those nights we need a quick, convenient meal.\n\nFirst: the prices at Bonita's are phenomenal. We get a ton of food, plus a drink plus churros, and never walk out of there paying more than $25.\n\nSecond: Bonita's is not Taco Bell, nor is it Filiberto's. It is SO much better. Yes, it's fast-casual (meaning you can eat it there or take it to go, it's not a sit-down-and-get-served place), but everything seems to be made fresh and is definitely made to order.\n\nThere are way too many items I could recommend to you, but some of our favorites are the bean & cheese burrito, the tacos (any kind) and the CHURROS. I can't say enough about the churros - I've tried churros far and wide, in many different states, and Bonita's is seriously amazing. \n\nLet me repeat: If you don't order the cajeta churro, you are not truly experiencing Bonita's. I don't even care if you're allergic to caramel - try the cajeta churro!! If you don't like it, your tastebuds are officially dead.\n\nSo good. Go. You likely won't be disappointed... and you definitely won't be disappointed if you choose that cajeta churro!
3760	1	a	Excellent place for a haircut. Quality haircut with little to no wait. Scalp massage is included with the haircut. It helps that the ladies are beautiful aswell.
3761	0	a	Decor is simple, friendly staff but too bad the food wasn't too great, raw fish wasn't fresh which made me had a really bad vertigo and got me very sick the next day. This is my first time experiencing food poisoning at a Japanese bistro. Not sure if Im planning on coming back.
3762	1	a	"Kuu is cooool.  Great tapas style Japanese food.  The service is good, but it is not great.  They are still going through the growing pains of a new restaurant, Although my waitress was really friendly and witty.  The place has a really nice decor.  I love the \""hardwood floor on the wall\"" look.  The quality of food is really good.  Unique items on the menu, however I wish the portions were a little bigger.  The prices are reasonable but you need a lot of dishes to be full, so the bill adds up quickly.  I am really happy this place is close to where I live because I love it and I will be back, OFTEN!"
3763	0	a	This place is the worst! Really unprofessional! I go there on a saturday night for a table of 3. The food is ok not superb. The girl who served us gets distracted because she sees her friends at the window and totally forgets about us! \n\nOur meals come in the wrong order when my cousin is still waiting for her food and she ordered sashimi when i ordered ramen! Cmon!!!! U gotta be fucking kidding me!\n\nAs for the bill, its all separate bills and the only thing i wanted split is the dessert in 2 and she couldn't even do that! The bills were all wrong and we didn't want to tip her. She had the audacity to ask for it... HELL NO! Bunch of posers who do not know a thing about running a restaurant.

3765	1	a	First off, this place sells Little Caesar plush dolls. That is awesome and should be worth a star there alone. I'm a big fan of restaurant mascots and I think we all might go to McDonald's once or twice to get a Grimace or Hamburglar doll. But that just might be me ;)\n\nLocation wise, its in a nice spot, across from Banner and within walking distance of MCC. There's not a lot of pizza places in this stretch and its right off the freeway too.\n\nThis is one of the nicest looking Little Caesar's pizzerias Ive seen. They have a lot of branded merchandise, bibs, toys, slicers and spatulas - which I haven't seen at a Little Caesar's before and that's pretty novel.\n\nThis location just opened yesterday and they were slammed. In the time I was there, about 10-15 minutes, They must've served at least 20-25 customers, so I have little doubt this place is filling a necessary void.\n\nThis place being new as well I didn't have their number. I usually like to call ahead since I don't like the Hot 'N Ready thing all the time and like having custom toppings. I showed up placed my order and waited. And what happened next, is what prompted me to write the review. They made a slip up with the pizza and let me know it wasn't right and offered me a three meat pizza on the spot or if I waited and gave them a chance to make it right, they'd comp my meal and give me free 2 liter of Pepsi and an order of Crazy Bread. I probably would've been ok with just the hey, let us fix this - cuz that says they care about what they're putting out. \n\nThe order came a few minutes later and before that the owner let me know, hey we care about good food but feel bad about making you wait so on top of the comp, we're going to give you a voucher for free pizza and free Crazy Bread on your next visit. Again, really above and beyond. Pizza came out shortly and they threw in not one but TWO free orders of Crazy Bread I didn't order just to say hey, sorry.\n\nChain or not, any business that takes the time to own up to any problems before they are problems and make good for them multiple ways should be lauded and thats the behavior that gets patrons to come back.\n\nAnd the pizza was good too.\n\nPlus, you know PLUSH DOLL!
3766	0	a	Highly overrated. The Dole Whip I got was $6 and it's cheaper at Disneyland!! Imagine that Disneyland with it's overpriced food. the portion was about 2/3 that of the one at Disneyland. \n\nWhite rabbit food trick fell major short- adobo taco was dry and bland and tiny tasteless! Wanted to throw it straight to the trash and after 1 bite that's what I did.\n\nSnow Fluff thai tea was bland and gross. Tried hard to eat it but it went into the trash. Maybe other flavors are better?\n\nWhite Castle was the best food I tried here and soon they will have a restaurant at the Las Vegas strip. \n\nMajor rip off. Overpriced and greasy food. Long lines and waits. You are better off going elsewhere. If you want to feel forced to eat disgusting food for your hard earned money, go here. I won't be back.
3767	0	a	Red dragon continues to lead with money first customer second so this one is no different than the other foodie fest . They keep changing venues which lets you know that they are gonna run out of places willing to host . Las Vegas is full of great places to eat without having to fill the pockets of a greedy company that doesn't care about its ticket holders or your feedback .
3768	0	a	Very disappointing.  Fewer trucks, same food at many, food quality mediocre, too many old school wagons, and less than friendly service at most. Not worth the battle with traffic. Missed all the Food Truck Race contestants I'm told dropped out in phases. Their food was quality and unique. This will be my second and last time.
3769	0	a	This was my first experience and as excited as I was to go, I was even more disappointed when we left. Not only do you have to pay to get in, but you have to pay for the food..I would've rather paid $50pp to get in and just walked around sampling foods, but instead I visited the lobster truck and I couldn't believe that for 3 entree's (2 lobster sandwiches and an order of lobster ceviche), it came out to $47!!! I could've gotten the VIP ticket!!!! I think the only saving grace was that there was a white castle truck there...this was supposed to be an experience of trying different foods and after spending almost fifty dollars at just one truck, I was done. Don't know that I will be going to any future events.
3770	0	a	Was not too impressed. $10 just to walk in and there wasn't really THAT much of a selection.\n\nAll of the food trucks were overpriced and the portions were small on top of that.\n\nYou're better off going to SoCal for the 626 Nightmarket or another food festival.
3771	0	a	$10.00 Just to get in the gate and be able to buy food from Food Trucks that sell on Las Vegas streets everyday. There is no discount after paying the gate charge. It's a ridiculous event with massively-over-priced Food and Drinks, yet people come. It blows my mind. \nExcept for the kiddie rides for the families, there is no justification for the gate charge. I will not come to another one!
3772	1	a	This was my second foodie fest so I knew what to expect.  Unfortunately it's always over priced. But the food at most trucks is amazing and unique so it's worth the extra few bucks!  Come hungry and bring people you can share with so you can try more different options.  This visit I tried Buldogis gourmet hot dogs, tornado potato,  get porked, the main lobster lady and of course... White castle.  \n\nOne disappointment of this visit was the lack of a beer garden that they had at the last event.  They still served beers but nothing on tap and only very limited bottle selections
3773	0	a	I've been to every Foodie Fest and I am sad to say this was by far the worst one.  I liked the Silverton ones best.  Unfortunately, Silverton is building time shares in its parking lot so it can't be there.  But I am not really sure it is even about location because the Linq is pretty cool.  My main issue is that there were way less trucks then at previous Foodie Fests.  I go to Foodie Fest mainly to try out of state trucks.  The majority of the trucks were local and most of the out of state ones had been here before.  This time there were not many big name trucks like they have had in the past (Devilicous, Nonna's Kitchenette, Seoul Sausage, Bacon Mania, Buttermilk Truck).  Obviously some of those trucks are no more, but there are a ton of awesome Cali/AZ trucks .  You can't get any of them to come?  I hit up my usual favorites Maine Lobster Lady, Jogasaki, Fluff Ice but there wasn't anything to get excited about.  I went early in the week so crowds were light and lines were short.  The food trucks have to pay to be a part of the event, I understand they raise prices to cover these costs along with gas,etc for the out of area trucks, but $4 for a can of Pepsi?  Come on.  I'm looking at you TruckU BBQ and you're local!  I think I will walk my ass down a couple stalls, pay a buck more and get a fresh lemonade with 1/2 off refills.  Come on Red Dragon bring back the Foodie Fest I loved.
3774	0	a	"The setup at foodie fest is not good. I had a \""VIP\"" pass to get into the blocked off VIP area, \""the red dragon lounge\"" or something of this nature? The VIP was the worst section of the whole festival. Lines were outrageous and only one dish tasted decent, the only good thing was free drinks but for how long you wait in line you can't get a ton of drinks anyway. \n\nThe rest of the festival was confusing. Some of the booths and trucks are so far spread out that it feels empty. I like a few of the trucks there, but I would much rather follow them on twitter and go to where they are than pay to get into foodie fest to pay again to eat at a food truck. \n\nThe only place I haven't had that I really wanted to try was sushi burrito and their line was literally 50 people deep which was not worth it to me. \n\nOverall, a very boring night and I didn't even leave full."
3775	0	a	"I have been going to this cleaners for years. I will never step foot in there again. I dropped off a pair of \""dry clean only\"" pants at a dry cleaners. Seems simple enough. I went to pick them up a day after they were due & I was told they weren't ready. I said I needed them for that night. Next thing I know, the female owner hands me a cell phone & tells me to speak to her husband.\n\nHe tells me that the pants were defective. I need to seek reimbursement from the store where I purchased. He would not offer me any reimbursement for the pants, which are quite expensive. I ask for the pants back. They were two tones, black & white. The white is now black. It appears that they were laundered, rather than dry cleaned.\n\nHad the owner offered to pay for the pants, I could move on. Shifting the blame to the manufacturer & expecting the 3rd party department store to refund me is ridiculous.\n\nI will never return to new select cleaners & advise you to stay away."
3776	1	a	I absolutely love this place. Great prices, Great management, and great quality services. I always take my Hugo Boss suits and shirts and they never disappoint me. I have dry cleaned in many places in arizona and they all do the job pretty well but it all comes down to customer service. I highly recommend you give this place a try because customer service is a priority at this dry cleaner.
3777	0	a	I'm sad - I have to write that the food at Zaba's was horrible. Dry, stale, withered were the fittest words to describe their food.\n\nAs much as I wanted to support a local business, I can't just blindly support anything... Simply put, Chipole is better.
3778	1	a	This is a great place for a Greek fix. The Henderson location is new and they want to please. Counter service needs to become more knowledgeable of preparation of menu items, otherwise he was quite helpful. The cook delivered our entree and later came out to dining room to make sure all was well.\n  We shared a combo plate, fries were seasoned and tastey, Chicken Shawarma and Gyro with fresh pita. They offer two types of taziki a thick and thin, make sure you order what you prefer. Hummus and Tabouli appetizer plate, Tabouli is different than I've had elsewhere, more green than wheat, made great compliment to meats on pita.\n  Give it a try
3779	0	a	Ehh it's alright definitely not authentic greek food , prob won't go back very blan, and they use sour cream to make tzatziki blah
3780	0	a	My wife and I had a horrible first, and last experience here... Hummus trio, while colorful lacked taste and had a strange consistency - and if you're going to charge that much for hummus more than a half-pita worth of dipping bread would be appreciated. Wife had a chicken Caesar sandwich - meh to that, but better than my choice... I had the Chicken Schwarma sandwich that had chickent that was so unbelievably dry and overcooked, with little to no sauce, that I couldn't even stomach swallowing half of the sandwich. Almost $30 spent on this visit and it was an abysmal experience.
3781	0	a	Decided to finally try the fairly new Greek place near me. I was happy to see they offered delivery. \nThis is where it all goes wrong. I called and the, very distracted sounding, girl told me there was no delivery. Oh well, I'll just drag myself over there. I finish placing my order and am told it will be ready in 20 minutes. I arrive closer to 25 minutes later, and walk into a restaurant full of very annoyed looking people...none of whom have food. 38 minutes later I walk out with my food. \nGreat food would make up for this. However the food was cold, the gyro meat was horribly dry, and everything else was so-so. \nI'm disappointed. Would love an excellent Greek option in my area. I just don't think this is it. \nI would have given 1 star but gave them an extra pity star because they seemed surprisingly shocked at how busy they were on a Sunday eve around 6pm. However, dry, cold food and at least an hour wait just isn't worth it.
3782	1	a	Excellent service. Very helpful with recommendations. We got red hummus and chicken shish kabobs. Dinner portions were more than enpugh. We took some home for the next day. We would definitely come here again.
3783	1	a	We wanted to try some place new so I took to my trusty pal Yelp to find a dinner spot. Jessie and I decided on Sultans Grill. \n\nIt's located in a busy strip mall with a bunch of other restaurants and businesses. Henderson especially older Henderson lacks different restaurants that's why  I'm so happy a Mediterranean spot has turned up. \n\nUpon entering we were immediately greeted by their friendly staff. Jessie and I perused the menu and decided to split the Sultan's Sampler and we both got the standard Gyro. The Sultan's sampler was great! It had a little bit of everything. The babaganoush and hummus were excellent and had tons of flavor. Plus, the pita bread was super tasty too. It had pickled beets on our sampler plate as well. I loved the pickled taste with the pita and hummus! Great combo. Our Gyros were huge and full of meat. The  tzatziki sauce was different then I've had before it had more of a sour cream base. It was the only thing that I didn't like. \n\nNow what made me love this place even more may not be a big deal to most, but is a huge deal to me. They actually have two different diet sodas!!! Diet Coke & Diet Dr Pepper! This is a rare thing!! Kudos to you Sultans Grill!\n\nOver all if you enjoy Mediterranean food you'll enjoy this spot! I can't wait to go back and try other items on their menu. Yummy!
3784	1	a	Always on point! Love that this place is a mile from home. Never had a bad meal. Greek salad with chicken Delish! Grape leaves awesome... I stop here prob once a week on my way home..
3785	0	a	Had a coupon and visited tonight.  \nOrdered a salad, gyro and sampler. \nChicken shawarma had good flavor but was very dry, lettuce was crisp.\nGyro was decent, but as others have previously mentioned, the tzatziki was like sour cream not yogurt-y.\nDidn't have very good flavor.\nWe also didn't care for the baba ghanoush, not enough garlic. The hummus was just meh, as was the tabouleh.\n\nIt would've been great if they were good, as not too many places to go around Henderson for Mediterranean food.\n\nNot likely to be back.
3786	1	a	Great food, good service, clean, very clean...... I wishes they served spinach pie every day, it's so good!
3787	1	a	Just moved to the Centennial hills area and our two long haired dauchund's were in desperate need of a groom as their last service was a shave down at the start of summer and after 5 months of swimming and traveling they were in need of some tlc. \n\nThere are plenty of choices of groomers in the area and even though one that is close by offered a lower price, I wasn't certain about the quality that I was going to get with the competitor. \n\nI called a few of the groomers and ended up bringing my babies in with short notice which was a nice change.  \nThe shop is cute, the owner Charity and her staff are friendly, we were greeted by the owners adorable receptionist Bonsia the poodle ! \nAbout the service: \nMy boys came out smelling wonderful, ( and not like a French whorehouse which some groomers do by dousing the dogs with perfume ) looking well groomed ( all sanitary trims done and excellent clipping and any muddled fur blended ) super clean, well conditioned ( which I have to say with long haired dogs they need a little special care for those tangles and shine). All in all these ladies go the extra mile to pamper your dog.  \n\nOne of my boys hates getting his nails trimmed and we have had issues with groomers in the past going overboard and having him be very sensitive afterwards.   Today he came out happy, barking and they even capped off his nails with some pawlish ! \nAll in all I am very pleased with the service from So Fetch and will be using them from now on for my babies.
3788	1	a	I order the Pad Thai and it was delicious. The location is very convenient to market square, right next to the McDonalds. It's very clean in there and the service is friendly. I recommend this restaurant for anyone looking for great Thai food on their lunch break.
3789	0	a	I have now eaten here twice.  The last time i ordered pad thai.  I will say no matter what spice level you say, it still comes out not that hot.  The food is pedestrian.  Nothing special.  It's not bad, and is quite edible.  The pad thai was a little bland for me.  It kind of just tasted like slightly fishy noodles.  I ordered the veggie pad thai and the second time the chicken pad thai.  Both tasted exactly the same.  I've had way worse.  I've also eaten way better.  Don't let the two stars fool you, I'd eat there again in a pinch and the staff is quite friendly.
3790	1	a	Went with my husband on the first day it was officially opened.  Shared a burger, basket of onion rings, and we each had a nice glass of wine.  It was happy hour so our bill totaled 20.00 and we loved everything.  Nice service (attentive but not hovering), perfectly juicy and flavorful burger (seriously tasty bun), and generous serving of nicely crunchy onion rings.  We are fortunate to live in Gilbert and I'm sure we will be enjoying many more delicious meals out on their beautiful patio.
3791	0	a	Tried for the first time.  We had the Blanco Burger and the El Diablo burger, with a side of Sweet potato fries.  Food was good but way over priced.  Service was good,  but the place was really noisy.
3792	0	a	"My husband and I are big fans of Sam Fox restaurants and were looking forward to the Zinburger opening in Gilbert. We expected the wait (45 minutes at 5:30pm on a Thursday) but when we finally got to a table it was one with a round bar stool for a seat. In looking around, I could see that there were very few chairs that seemed remotely comfortable. \n\nOverall, it was a big let down. The wine was the highlight of the meal. We both ordered burgers that turned out to be nothing special. The meat was cooked properly, but like one other reviewer said, it was so greasy and the bun so flimsy I ended up eating just the meat about half way through. Honestly, I think SmashBurger does a better job.\n\nFor a side, we ordered zucchini fries. I was hoping for crunchy sticks and got a plate of limp, greasy breaded zucchini with the tiniest amount of dipping sauce. We also ordered the latte milkshake. It was good, and they did split it into two smaller glasses for us, but nothing I would go out of my way to have again. \n\nThe service was just okay, too. Our waiter was nice enough, but the other three employees who brought food/drinks to our table never said a word. None of them even made eye contact with us. After the third one, my husband made a \""Stepford\"" comment. \n\nAt this time, Zinburger is not worth the wait or the money. In our minds the gold standard of burgers is Burger Bar in Las Vegas. This place falls so short of it, we won't be back."
3793	0	a	"So you have to ask yourself...is $50 ($60 with tip) for 2 burgers, one small salad, one order of zucchini fries and 2 sodas a good buy.  If so, then this may be the place for you.  If not...keep on going.\n\nSo about the food...\n\n- Burgers -- good but not remarkable.  \n- Small chopped wedge salad --  pretty good actually.  \n- Zucchini fries -- Ok.  That being said, you really can't turn zucchini into \""fries.\""  What you actually end up with is strips of zucchini coated in breadcrumbs (or whatever it was) that cooks up somewhat crisp with zucchini inside that ends up being somewhat flaccid.\n- Soda -- soda is soda.\n\nFor whatever reason the restrooms are located outside the restaurant...kind of like a gas station.  Not sure why or how that design choice was made, but it almost seems like they built the building and realized they forgot to put in a bathroom.  Not smart.\n\nThe seating in the restaurant is odd at best, horrible at worst.  The have some bar height tables with chairs that have low backs...not the most comfortable.  The rest of the interior has tables with long bench seats and what looks to be metal chairs.  I don't like long bench seats and I've yet to find a metal chair that is comfortable.  The outside seating area is similar.\n\nThe wait staff seemed pretty switched on.  However, we were asked if we wanted our salad and zucchini fries first followed by the burgers.  The salad and fries did show up first...immediately followed by the burgers.\n\nNot sure I'll be back as I just didn't see the value in going.  That being said I'm sure they'll be wildly successful given their old town Gilbert location.\n\nNot a 3 and not a solid 2...mostly a 2.5 but I'm not going to round up."
3794	0	a	I went here today. Save your money and go to 5 guys. Over priced burgers that are not that good. 12.50 for a burger I would have expected some real flavor. Boring burger that was greasy and I didn't finish it all. And I really would have expected a side of fries for the price...nope just the sad boring burger. Now on another note service was excellent. So if you want some wine and look at the very attractive staff eat here. Want a good burger...sorry folks go else where.\n\nI'm not sure where these other reveiwers ate.but it doesn't sound like it was here.
3795	0	a	I was really hoping to enjoy this place.  Great location in a modern building. The problem was more with the kitchen than anything else.\n\nCame when there wasn't a crowd and was asked to sit inside or outside. Chose inside and was seated quickly in the middle of a long row of tables.  Waitress was very friendly and the service was quite good. We ordered and waited.\n\nMy stepdaughter had the Kobe burger and asked for it to be 'medium', it was rare. My girlfriend asked for the Turkey burger, it was under cooked with a soft white center and had to be sent back to the kitchen. I had the Samburger which as a burger with bacon on it. I asked for it to be medium rare and got it very rare.  I like rare anyway, but not what I had asked for. The buns were nice and soft and the flavor was ok.  On the bright side, the loaded fries were very good, according to my stepdaughter.\n\nThere is a lot of new competition in Gilbert and not performing well is not going to help. I am sure other Yelpers liked this place, but it will not be one of my top picks.  I will try it again in a month or two to see if they have fixed their kitchen. I can cook faster and better than these guys. AND, I am not classically trained.
3796	0	a	For the price I was really expecting better. The bun on my burger was soggy and the meat was just ok. I had the salted caramel shake which was really good. The zucchini fries were good but greasy. If I were to come back I would just get the shake.
3797	1	a	Where do I begin?!... We've been waiting for a minute for this place to open and boy was it worth the wait. Started with the Raspberry Acai Margarita (phenomenal), my husband had a local beer (IPA) and the Green Chili Fries (spicy and flavorful). My husband ordered the double burger, I ordered the Turkey burger and my almost 3 year old son had a kids burger and ATE IT ALL for the first time!! All 3 burgers were fresh, juicy and full of flavor!! Our server Brandy was amazing! We will be back for sure! Oh and on a side note for picky water drinkers like myself....NOT tap water wahoo!!
3798	1	a	Great burgers. Really nice atmosphere. We all really liked the food. Drinks were great. The watermelon mojo to was so good
3799	1	a	Great burger place, great service our order came out fast (which is nice when your starving) roomy dinning area, nice outside patio. Burger was nice a juicy! I got the burger of the day which was kobe beef patty with avocado, bacon and American cheese and my boyfriend got the samburger, both great but they tasted the same..so in other words I wouldn't pay the $5 extra for the kobe beef...I've had American kobe beef before and it tasted like steak, this just tasted like ground beef which is okay but for $15? Oh and thats not including fries...it ranges $5-$7 extra.Anyways I recommend to try it out if you like burgers and shakes!
3800	0	a	Awful! Burger was not cooked properly, they forgot the saut\u00e9ed onions on the burger, and the onion rings were waaay too salty. We sent them all back. For the money, you can get much better food right next door.
3801	0	a	First time to this place.... Now I may be tough due to the fact that I am in restaurant business for over 17 yrs..\nService on a scale of 1 to 10 .. 10 being top score they score 4\nFood 8\nPrice score 5 very expensive when you add your sides and so on( at high tide seafood bar and grill ) surf and turf lobster / burger with sides and cheese $14.. Here just cheese burger and fries is $17.\n Kale salad very odd.. Waiter never refill water... Lack of consistency ... Not friendly ... Hostess were good.. Managers walking around and never check tables .. A dirty table with dirty dishes sitting next to us for about 12 mins and almost 7 staff walk by and look at the dirty table and walk to the kitchen barehanded .. Finally hostess started to clean it... Would I go back.. Probably not.. Overall they score low with me...
3802	0	a	Party of 5 for take out,100 bucks.-No Thank you. Never again. Burgers were not cooked all the way and dripping out blood. 5 $'s for fries-REALLY!
3803	1	a	This place is amazing! We went for date night (without the kids) and couldn't have been more pleased!\n\nPros: truffle fries, zinburger, Latte Shake - everything we had was delicious! The burgers melted in your mouth. Really, the best ever. \n\nCons: Price - it's not really a con if you are aware ahead of time. It's equivalent to Charlestons pricing. \n\nIf you're looking for a cool, trendy, clean place to eat with even better food then the decor - go now!
3804	0	a	My first visit. The quality of the beef is good. Overall, I found the burger bland. The bun was squishy and fell apart. The place is new and stylish. One style I am not a fan of is lots of tv and no nice abatement in the decor.
3805	1	a	Great food. And great server. A friend brought up an issue that occurred and the manager did not seem to care. She had no sympathy and blew the topic off subject. Clearly, she did not understand the context of what was going on. Besides that, definitely would come back!
3806	0	a	I've been there twice. First let me tell you that this place is like a high end steakhouse ONLY in the aspect that you purchase the entree and anything else is extra. Buying a burger does NOT include fries or slaw. Now if you read my reviews, I have no problem dining and paying for dinners at high end steakhouses and paying for the sides. No problemo!\nFor a burger joint, it ain't gonna happen.\nFirst time there I had the no bun burger and fries. Tasty but nothing to write home about. Tonight I had the zinburger and coleslaw. The zinburger was tasty. Coleslaw is coleslaw! To charge $3 for it...the cost of that is probably ten cents. I won't do that again.\nI ordered a Absolut and tonic. They came back and told me they were out of Absolut and suggested Belvedere or Ketel. I told the waiter that I am not going to mix Ketel One so I'll have it on the rocks.  \nThe burger was tasty but not worth $10.50. I realize it is 100% Certified Angus Beef...but so is every burger that Carl's Jr. sells and they charge half the price and you get fries!!\nMy wife ordered the Wedge salad. They don't serve wedge salads. It was a chopped salad. \nThe bill comes and my wife's house red wine was $8 and my Ketel One on the rocks was $10.50!! And it was a shitty pour!\nYou go to Donovan's for a great steak and you order a drink on the rocks and you pay but you get a righteous pour! \nWe won't be going back to zinburger with Oregano's across the street.
3807	0	a	Waited for months for this place to open.  Finally got in after work about 4pm.  Services was slow.  Had 2 burgers, Laoded frys, zucchini frys a soda and a beer.  Over $60.00 once we added tip.  As for favor...really nothing outstanding.  Next time We want a good burger I'll go down the street across from the police station.\n\nNice open restaurant for the younger crowd.  Will we go back...maybe but not any time soon.
3808	1	a	A must when in downtown Gilbert. If you want an excellent hamburger that's not your traditional one then this is the place.  The atmosphere is casual, great for a date and also good for families. Has a good sized bar with GREAT beer on tap. I recommend getting here early around 1130 for lunch or 530pm for dinner otherwise expect a wait because everyone wants to come experience this great place.
3809	1	a	My brother and mom absolutely love this place, as done my extended Phoenix family. It's a very bright and cool restaurant. I loved the all-white walls and ceiling, especially with our lunchtime being on a sunny day. I thought since we arrived around 2/230 that it'd be dead and we could walk in with no wait - I was wrong! I guess Arizonans like to lunch late. The wait wasn't bad at all which gave me time to peruse the menu. \nWe sat outside, right under a heater, but it would've been nice to have another. \nOur server was sweet and on-point. She made sure we were taken care of!\nShe suggested the Double Truffle fries as a starter. They were meh - we would've been fine without them. Get the Sweet Potato fries instead. \nAll 3 burgers came out amazing! I didn't try my mom's and brother's, but they loved them. My Blanco Burger was messy - use a fork & knife instead of trying to eat it with a bun. I can't wait to return and try another.
3810	0	a	We had an ahi burger - zero taste compared to other local Ahi Burgers, server never heard of wasabi mayo and they did not carry.  Also had the Kobe burger- nothing special to pay 15-20 on.  I'm all for paying extra but if the food doesn't deliver, well then-
3811	0	a	Burgers overpriced, buns stale, fry's cold, nothing special!   Nice atmosphere, but not worth the wait.  4 people, hamburgers, fry's, iced tea, over $80 bucks!   Hmmmmmm!
3812	0	a	Good place if you like under-cooked (not-cooked) raw burgers - dangerous combination with drunk hungry people. \n\nAside from that OK place with ping pong and foosball table. Nice service and music as well.
3813	1	a	For those of us who believe we should've been born during a different era....or at least dress like we were....there is Kitten Retro Glamour. This amazingly cute boutique offers classic vintage fashion, but from new labels like Pinup Couture and Tatyana Designs. I usually buy all my pinup and vintage-inspired fashion online or during trips to Las Vegas. Thankfully Kitten opened up right here in Phoenix!! Not only is the boutique so cute and pink and girly, but the owners little touches go a long way toward good customer service and repeat business. I couldn't believe the cuteness of her pink pastry gift boxes and hand written thank-you napkins placed in my shopping bag. She was amazingly helpful as my sister tried on dresses and I perused the accessories and gushed over her new store. Thank you for opening up locally! Now I can get my fix anytime I want!!!!
3814	1	a	I'm going to be honest. I've avoided this place since they opened in July because I was afraid of sticker shock. My fiance gets his haircut next door every month and I'm usually with him. Last weekend was the Pinup Pop Up event and I was getting antsy waiting around so I reluctantly went in to Kitten Retro Glamour expecting to be let down when I looked at the price tags. I TOTALLY wasn't! For vintage inspired QUALITY clothing, this place has some of the best prices I've seen! I found a brown faux fur stole that the owner generously placed on hold for me for a week so I could come back to try it on with my wedding dress and it was perfect! I plan on coming back after the holidays to try on a few other items! Kitten Retro Glamour won't let you down!
3815	1	a	Thank goodness this type of restaurant has come to Phoenix: BBQ and seafood boil! You can smell the BBQ once you walk in and it is a delight. Definitely get the ribs with the mustard sauce; they worked perfectly together. The pulled pork was quite moist and a sizable portion - my meat loving friends will be so satisfied. My heart lies with seafood and am pleased to have so many high quality options at affordable costs. The snow crab was delectable with the Trifecta. The shrimps were massively plump and when combined with the Pacific Rim sauce...this yellow curry was too good and I cannot wait to try it out with the crab. And my favorite, mussels with the lemon pepper sauce. Tender and full of flavor. The best aspect though is how happy and attentive the staff are. It is obvious they love to be working in such a quality and fun environment. \n\nI will be a regular here most definitely!
3816	1	a	The food was great! Very delicious,  good flavors. The staff was very friendly. I will definitely be back!
3817	0	a	"I don't work for the Angry Crab so my review will be more honest.  I arrived at 3:10 pm, thinking they just opened.  The place was already very busy.  The staff is trained to be high energy, so when I entered the employees began  screaming at me, \""hootin and hollerin\"" if you will.  I thought I was doing a curtain call.  Remember, this is the first day.  I ordered a drink and there was much confusion as glassware is limited to mason jars' I ordered fried oysters and bbq baked beans.  The beans were immediately served, (I make much better).  I played with the beans but did not eat them.  Five to ten minutes later my drink and oysters arrived.  The drink was OK and the oysters need future attention. The acoustics are terrible!  With all of the noise, I had to leave.  I'll try the bbg next time, but the portions were not as large as the first review stated.  I'm glad there is finally a  restaurant in the vacant slot.  I hope they get the bugs worked out.  I also be glad when  there's less help asking me if everything is OK."
3818	1	a	We have been huge fans of ACS in Mesa since it opened (see my review). We have been driving all the way across town to eat there every few weeks. \n\nNeedless to say, we were absolutely psyched to have one open a few minutes from our house. \n\nIt looks like they retained a lot of what made the first restaurant so successful. The atmosphere is casual and the writing on the walls and paper table cloths makes it perfect for kids. \n\nIn addition, there is a huge patio which will be great in the nice weather, a way bigger bar and beer selection and, importantly, BBQ!\n\nLike the other location, service was impeccable and genuinely cheerful. It seems like people are actually happy working there. \n\nWe had the snow crab legs- per usual with trifecta. It was perfect. We then tried the brisket. Flavors were great. I prefer my brisket a little more tender, but given it was the very first day, I'm sure they will nail it. We also had some sausage that was really good.\n\nWe met up with old friends and just had a great meal and a great time. \n\nWe will be back often.
3819	1	a	What a treat this evening was! A bunch of us yelpers met here for a get-together organized by Arana W. The place is spacious and bright, thanks to the big windows in front of the restaurant. It was noisy in a fun way with a very lively vibe, thanks in part to the enthusiasm of the staff who seemed to me to really enjoy their work here. I ordered a pound of shrimp with trifecta sauce, heat level 2 (the levels go up to 5, but the highest 2 levels are strictly for the very brave), with corn on the cob, sausage, and red potato. What a dynamite combination: big, sweet shrimp, some of the best I've ever had. The other items were perfect complements, all bathed in that glorious trifecta sauce. Upon Arana's suggestion, I ordered Abita Pecan Harvest to wash it all down ... excellent recommendation.  I'm so glad this place opened in Arcadia. I love Angry Crab in Mesa, but now I don't have to drive as far to enjoy a great seafood experience.
3820	1	a	Absolutely a five star for last night's feast. This their second location is just as energizing and friendly as the Mesa location. The seafood and bbq was awesome with 5 star service!  No complaints from our party of 5. See you soon and thank you again! :-)
3821	1	a	"Firstly let's get one thing clear: New Orleans is my jam. I freaking love that city. I love that nothing ever closes. I love that people speak French. I love that you can take drinks TO-GO from restaurants. I love that it is simultaneously home to some of the finest white-glove restaurants in America as well as some of the seediest, most degenerate bars that have ever been built. And most importantly, I LOVE the food.  So when I saw that Angry Crab, a Mesa restaurant that I've been meaning to get my Cajun fix from for months, was opening a new location down the street from my house, I was beyond thrilled.\n\nAngry Crab doesn't necessarily bill itself as a \""New Orleans\"" restaurant, but the elements are there. Cajun seafood boils, po-boys, oysters (even char-grilled!), and alligator are all on the menu and when we ventured over, a whopping 4 days after they open (I'm surprised I could even wait that long) I knew exactly what I wanted: A dozen raw oysters and a pound of crawfish.  Unfortunately, after we were greeted by our cheerful waitress, we were informed \""We're out of crawfish and we're out of raw oysters\"". Whomp whomp. So I guess they need to work out some kinks in inventory, understandable since they've been open for such a short period of time, but I honestly might not have even gone had I known that in advance.\n\nInstead we split a dozen wings (kinda like oysters right? Except...not at all), I got a pound of snow crab (trifecta sauce, spice level 2) and Lance got the Alligator Basket.  The wings were delicious. Instead of traditional wing sauce we just got the same trifecta sauce they use for the boils and it was fantastic, no ranch or any additional dipping sauce was needed.  My crab legs were also awesome, and a HUGE portion. I wasn't exactly sure how much a \""pound\"" would be, considering the shell-meat weight ratio, but it was more than enough for me and would probably be enough for two people to share with a couple apps and sides.  At $15/lb that day for the snow crab (less or more for other items), I thought it was a pretty decent value.  I was too busy working for my food to try any of the Alligator basket but it was devoured so I'm sure it was good too.\n\nAll-in-all, I'm looking forward to Angry Crab reversing the curse of that particular location so I can keep getting my NOLA fix without buying a $300 plane ticket (and nursing a 3-day hangover because, come on, it's New Orleans). I'll update when I can go back to get my oysters and crawfish, which I'm sure I'll find a way to do VERY soon (though I'll call ahead this time)."
3822	1	a	The BBQ is fantastic! Delicious trifecta sauce. Great ambiance and service! Never been to a place like this in Phoenix before.
3823	1	a	Lucky to have this new Seafood/BBQ restaurant in my neighborhood.  The place is loud, it is messy, people graffiti all over the walls.  I love it!  I would say it is perfect for a first date as if you date does not like to eat with their hands while wearing a plastic bib, well then, best you know that right up front.  \n\nWhile we did not try the BBQ, the seafood was outstanding. I will probably not go with the fried seafood next time but if that is your thing, then go for it.  The real star here is the fresh seafood.  We ordered a pound of shrimp and a pound of snow crab.  It was perfectly cooked and served quickly.   Thank you to our server Matthew for his outstanding service.
3824	1	a	Met up with some friends to get down and dirty with them!  What? Down and dirty?  That's right, it's a crab boil, its messy, it's saucy, and you get very dirty! But don't worry they have a washing station nearby so you can clean up quick like.\n\nIt was my 1st experience with a crab boil ever, so I leaned on friend's advice on which way to go, I knew I wanted Snow Crab and with great help I went with the trifecta level 2, now this had some great flavor man it was delish, but next time I think I will kick it up a bit and try the heat level 3.\n\nIt was one pound of Snow Crab at market price, which at that time was 15 bucks, honestly that's not bad at all if you think about how much a good meal would cost you elsewhere.  The Snow Crab was cooked perfectly, it was so juicy and tender I was very sad to see I ate it all it was that good!\n\nI also added an order of hush puppies, that was some fried up goodness right there and tried out there bbq beans, those were not the most pretties to look at but it made up in flavor for sure, before I knew it. it was gone.\n\nThe Angry Crab was a great dinner choice, look forward to going back!
3825	0	a	stopped in tonight to get food to go on the way home, no one wanted to go out.\nhave never been here before and wont be back. placed my order, pound of shrimp boil $12, pound of crab boil $15, hush puppies. sat on bench across hostess station, waited and waited and waited. people coming and going having a good time, eating drinking, still waiting. saw about three tables get sat well after I placed my to order getting there food and eating. after about 45min I stood up from the bench and the hostess asked if I was waiting on something and said yes my order, she looked at me and said your order? I said I have been sitting here for 45 min waiting for my to go order watching these people that came 15 and 20 min after I put in my to go order already eating and half way done with there food, blank stare from hostess. with that I left and will not return.
3826	1	a	Went with 5 other friends and everything was great!  Our server Mathew was great as well.
3827	1	a	So the service sucks. Not in a rude way, but just kind of slow and we had three servers ...  Also all food was delivered at different times w no explanation until the last person's food was not delivered for a few minutes. Also, I wanted dessert but just dropped off the check before asking ? Okay.. Also, menu would be confusing if you didn't know what was going on... But ....\n\nAs for the food... Yum! The spice levels are off (the staff will tell you this though) I had the king crab trifecta level 3... Definitely not medium.. I love Spicy and could have gone 4 but this was still pretty hot. \n\nWe also had gumbo, which was delicious. I would recommend... Just be ready to get down and dirty (and maybe wait a little)
3828	0	a	First of all, I really wish I could rate this place higher; our neighborhood really could use some good bbq and seafood. Here's our experience:\nMy wife & I were quickly seated, and our waitress quickly got to our table and explained how things work at the Angry Crab. At this point we're thinking we are in for a good meal. Drinks were served right away and we looked forward to the arrival of the food. This is where things went downhill. \n\nMy meal arrived first. I ordered the brisket which was not good. It was mooshy and tasteless aside from the bbq sauce that was ladled onto the meat right before it arrived. The meat tasted like it may have been boiled before it was put into the smoker. If you want to taste the real thing head to south Phoenix and try Little Miss BBQ (it's a TEN). I did eat most of the brisket because I was hungry. I give it a 3 out of 10. Bummer.\n\nAfter I completely finished my meal my wifes diner arrived. Timing not so good. \n\nShe ordered battered shrimp. We expect deep fried anything to have some oil on it since it is submerged in the stuff until cooked. Problem here was that the fries tasted like shrimp, so we think it is all deep fried together. Also, the batter held onto too much of the grease. It left a heavy after taste. The corn that was served was COLD, not like it had become cold by sitting, but cold as if just taken out of the fridge cold (yuk!). \n\nI brought a pulled pork sanny home for  my daughter. I tasted the pork once home: same mooshy boiled flavor the brisket had. It was not something I would order again. Sorry guys.\n\nThe drinks were great and Rachel provided great service. I really want this place to work, so I am going to give it another try. I will order the crab and shrimp boil next time I go in. I hope it is good. I can tell they are trying, so the place has a chance since the owners and staff seem to be putting out effort. Sometimes all it takes is a little honest feedback and positive response for a restaurant to really make a splash.
3829	0	a	Tonite I went the shrimp scrawny not their usual service very disappointed.  I've gone to the Mesa location & OMG big juicy shrimp & snow crab this time I was very disappointed.  The shrimp scrawny she'll was stuck to the shrimp.  I felt like the hoodwinked me this was just bad. Not happy at all.
3830	1	a	A must try when in Phoenix. So much better than Hot n Juicy spots. Cajun fries was delish & shrimp bag was awesome. Add corn in your seafood bag for extra taste. \n\nCareful when picking your spice level cuz even mild is spicy. As for the sauce opt for the trifecta choice which is Cajun, lemon pepper & garlic sauce.
3831	1	a	My kind of food here - seafood steamed/boiled in spicy seasonings with an option for barbecue. This is one of those places where the bigger the group of people the better the value. You order by the pound, you share, and everyone gets messy together.\n\nI brought a friend from back East and we both grew up on seafood from the Chesapeake Bay. We were looking forward to blue crabs but they were out. From the remaining seafood choices - and we decided to stick with seafood instead of barbecue - we chose shrimp, crawfish, and king crab legs. Trifecta sauce, mild heat because our server, Dion, said that things run on the spicy side.\n\nSo, it's entirely possible that ordering Alaskan King crab legs at the angry crabshack and barbecue is a bit of a reach. I didn't care because I have to try them, right?\n\nI wasn't disappointed in them, however, roasted and then split and served with drawn butter is just the best way to eat Alaskan King crab legs and now I know. Everything was delicious just the same and cooked just right. Nothin worse than rubbery overcooked skrimps and there was none of that here. \n\nI couldn't pass up the sausage four-piece and I'm glad that I tried it because it is excellent. For me it was the most memorable part of the entire meal and I will be going back soon for more. I've got to try the barbecue as well. Whoever runs the smoker seems to know what they're doing with wood and low heat.
3832	1	a	A great place to go if you are ready to dig in and get messy! Our group tried just about everything and the food quality was awesome, especially for the price. I would recommend the shrimp which are huge and super tasty. We also tried the BBQ side of things, which is pretty good, but I prefer the seafood. They also have a pretty good beer list and and TVs to watch sports. The only downside is that it's super messy and a lot of work so you tend to be focused on workin for your food instead of talking to your friends. But if you are up for it, it's great! I'm glad they moved into the neighborhood!
3833	1	a	Love, Love LOVE this place!  We met friends there for the Cardinal vs Seahawks game for the first time and came back on Christmas eve!  The King Crab is amazing as well as the Lobster! The trifecta sauce really is good.  I went for the mild spice and it does have some kick.  Goes down great with a Four Peaks Kiltlifter.  This is 'get in and get messy' eating at it's finest!  They even gave their best shot at duplicating a Sugar Plum Martini for me!  A favorite place for sure!  The BBQ is great, too!  It can be as inexpensive as the BBQ or as spendy as the Lobster.
3834	1	a	December 26, 2014 12:35 pm. Spacious parking lot in a strip mall anchored by a Sprouts store. We immediately got seated and we waited on by a pleasant gentleman, Ben. Their menu was simple enough. My advice for the uninitiated in this type of establishment is to start the least spicy the step up on subsequent visits. It's better to be able to be able to eat your food than completely waste it because it was burning your tongue to ashes. We also had tasted their Gator nuggets, it was our first time to ever devour a reptile, and we thoroughly enjoyed it. The oysters were good as well. But our personal highlight was the soft-shelled crab. It was fried perfectly and was delicious. Highly recommended.
3835	0	a	Went to this place before Christmas and we ordered a couple lbs of shrimp and crawfish. We are a regular at their angry crab Mesa location and expect the same taste with the tri-fecta sauce, but it was disappointing to say the least, there wasn't enough garlic or any butter in the sauce, it tasted like water. It basically tasted like watered sauce steam shrimp. We asked the server how come it taste nothing like the taste we had at their Mesa location, they said maybe the cook kinda messed up the sauce recipe. I understand this location just opened and there are many things to work out but surely their trifecta (most popular) sauce need some serious work at this location. Friendly servers and the pacific rim sauce was good though.
3836	1	a	Well... Came out with a giant smile. First timer and definitely coming back. Beware you might not want to bring your nicest clothes, it will get messy. \n\nTo order you pick the seafood you want and order by the pound, then pick your sauce and how spicy you want it. I threw in sausage and corn for a small fee. \n\nWe ordered snow crab, clams, mussels, and shrimp. And they all tasted fresh and very yummy. We also ordered rice and fries. The fries are very very good as well.\n\nIf you're not into seafood they have bbq also, but I have yet to try it. The table next to us ordered bbq and it looked great!
3837	0	a	"This is decent but only slightly above a Milestone or Moxies restaurant. \n\nFood: \n1. Carbonara flat bread: meh... Reminded me nothing of a carbonara\n2. Beef cheek oranchini : good sauce, good taste little meat but it's was good\n3. Chicken supreme: moist and perfectly chard crust. My husband really enjoyed it\n4. Burger : both of my friends ordered this and loved it. They absolutely loved it\n5. \""Tenderloin steak\"": ordered tenderloin for $29 plus the shrimp and fingering potatoes. Decent but they brought me the side trimming of a sirloin steak which isn't even on the menu and they didn't even adjust the price. I told the waitress I was very hungry and that I would eat it. However, I expect at least an apology and I would think it fair that you reduce the cost of my steak plate because it's a cut of steak your restaurant doesn't even offer!!! I feel offended that they would think so little of their customers. \n\nService: Unrefined and just phostess too timid to tell you the table is ready. \n\nWaitress: appeared confused and afraid of questions regarding the beer selection. \n\nAfter I told her about the steak she said she would let someone know but it was never addressed by her or anyone else."
3838	1	a	So far so good. Their first day open today. The Chile Verde was very flavorful, beans were good! Green and red sauce were thick and tasty. The marinated carrots are a nice bonus. Can't wait to try more of the menu, I'll keep you posted.\n\n\nThis appears to be a whole new operation;\nThis is the former location of two other taco shops, Mi Casita and then the same Owner changed it to Pepe's taco shop, they don't appear to be apart of this new operation.
3839	1	a	Food is excellent and they have a great variety to choose from. The service quick and friendly. Hopefully they will do so well they will have to expand as this location is a little small. We will definitely be coming back.
3840	1	a	Love love love them!  Have gone several times and have ordered different things. Everything is top notch. Especially the cheese enchiladas, wow they are good. We went last week to get them to take for lunches. Last time I got a cheese quesadilla, what a good deal it is, huge with lots of cheese.  We will be there this week I am sure.
3841	0	a	Good food but not open consistently. Opens early one day then not open early. How am I going to get my breakfast burrito.
3842	1	a	Been waiting for a good taco shack in Maricopa and it finally arrived. I can't stand Tacos and More and Cilantros is just too pricey for all the rice/beans in my carne asada. It's exactly what I've been waiting for the great chain taco shop.
3843	0	a	The young lady working the front could use an attitude check. Not only did she snatch my card out of my hand to swipe it, she had the nastiest customer service I have seen. I was ordering my meal and she stopped in the middle of writing down my order and offered to help another patron. The other customer commented that she could finish my order (I was not taking long I swear!) and I managed to finish up. The floors were recently mopped with a stinky mop that left the floor sticky and I can't stop fuming over the young woman taking orders. \n\nThey charge $.50 to run your card as well. \n\nFood was good. That's the reason for the extra star. Our food was delicious.\n\nThe same girl taking orders came out next to our table and started sweeping the carpet. I asked her to please stop as we were in the middle of our meal and I didn't feel like having a seasoning of dust on my food. She sulked off to the back and began calling us sucias because we asked her to stop. I speak Spanish fluently and work as an interpreter so listening to her cowardly run to the back to talk about us was insulting. Rather than continue to listen and experience this behavior I left. I'm too tired to get into it with a little girl.
3844	0	a	There are many good inexpensive places to to eat but this isn't one of them. I'll admit the food was slightly above average but if this place is going to make it the girl behind the counter needs to go elsewhere. She acts as if she could careless if helps you or not. She has a very arrogant attitude. We will not be returning, low quality and bad service.
3845	1	a	The portions are large, the price is low, and the green Chile burrito is spicy. Decent service, excellent food. Highly recommend this place.
3846	1	a	Excellent service, very clean and best of all an awesome steak.  Will be going back many times.  Loved the mashed potatoes and Mac and cheese, great sauce and mushrooms.
3847	1	a	"I just discovered this new restaurant, and it far exceeded my expectations. Dash Grill serves chef-created gourmet food at reasonable prices in a casual atmosphere. For dinner I ordered the Seared Tuna Sandwich with a side of wine-marinated mushrooms and it was delicious. The tuna was seared to my specifications (medium-rare), served on a brioche bun, and then dinner was followed-up with a dessert of chocolate mousse. The mousse was beautifully served in an edible chocolate \""tea cup\"" and was not too heavy or sweet--just the right consistency to be the perfect capstone to a tasty dinner. I will be back here regularly. The formula here is a winner in that you can get awesome gourmet food at affordable prices, since ordering happens deli-style at the front counter. Although the staff deliver the food to your table and are attentive to your needs, there are no waiters or waitresses, so there is no tipping expense or expensive wait-staff budgets. Very affordable, friendly and delicious!"
3848	0	a	"Our order:\nSml Caesar Salad---$8\n\nMy daughter said \""it did not taste good.\""  It was a Caesar Salad; so, the dressing or something else was off.\n\nRoot Beer---$3.50\n\nComes from a bottle.  Pretty high mark up for a regular bottle of root beer.  Really?\n\nHot Chocolate---$2 (x2)\n\nOkay hot chocolate that comes in a paper cup and plastic lid.  Pretty expensive for instant hot chocolate.\n\n2 Seared Scallops & 4 Shrimp (they do not tell you how many you get) w/ mac & cheese and garlic mashed potatoes---$24\n\nShrimp had pretty good taste, and the scallops had a nice sear, but the main course was really skimpy.  Both sides were very bland.\n\nSalmon with Crab (sides were Garlic Mash and Braised Mushrooms).  \n\nFish was bland.  Garlic Mash bland. The mushrooms were atrocious. \""Absolutely disgusting\""\n\n*they charged me $2 for a soda/tea I did not reviece.  With horrible food like this, they need that $2 more than me.\n\nWe will never come back here again.  \n\n\""We should have gone to 5 & Diner instead\"""
3849	1	a	Gourmet food at affordable prices!  We didn't know what to expect when we went there, but was pleasantly surprised by the food quality and service.  Being a new restaurant they have some kinks to work out but as long as you have good food and service, can only get better!\n\nBetween the 3 of us we split between the new yorker, kalua pork, and tips and taters and they were all fantastic.
3850	0	a	Over priced, bland good. Atmosphere, what a joke its a walk up order and sit down. They couldn't even get my son's order right, plain hamburger nothing else on it, came fully dressed. The tuna was frozen and not fresh plus you can get it cheaper and a great sauce at firebird. I think the only reason that they get higher is from those that don't know God food and great value and hope for a free mall from this place
3851	1	a	Love this place. It's locally owned with a warm family feel - it's refreshing to not deal with a chain restaurant. I've tried several things: Salmon with crab meat, shrimp, burger, scallops, salad, sides, etc and like them all! Everything is freshly prepared the way you want it. There are no fried foods. There is no wait staff so you can hang out with the kids and play games with no pressure to hurry up. It's very clean especially the restroom. I'm looking forward to going back.
3852	1	a	We were very impressed with a smoke shop that actually smelled good...and they gave a generous donation to our worthy cause. What a great place and owners are awesome!
3853	1	a	This place is 1/2 craft beer, 1/2 smoke shop. They ONLY carry craft beers, and are willing to try and get whatever you are looking for. Prices are good, selection is good, owners are friendly. Forget those mega-stores and come here if you are in the area.
3854	0	a	La fl\u00e8che est rapide mais pas Le service , de plus si \u00e7a continue comme \u00e7a, elle va rater sa cible.une petite formation du personnel ne serait pas du luxe. Bien que la qualit\u00e9 des produits soit bonne, les servir froids ne donne pas envie de revenir. Bon, ce n'est qu'un bar qui se veut sp\u00e9cialiste du gibier, mais au prix demand\u00e9, un autre effort serait appr\u00e9ci\u00e9.Quant \u00e0 la carte des desserts, elle tient sur une ligne! Il nous faudrait un Robin des Bois pour atteindre la cible
3855	0	a	Barmaids vraiment pas gracieuses, videur \u00e0 l'entr\u00e9e assez con et pr\u00e9tentieux. Le bar en lui meme est pas mal mais les gens et le personnel ne sont pas a la hauteur d'un bar du plateau.
3856	0	a	"I cannot explain the discomfort I felt inside of this Ulta location.\n\nUpon entering this location with my mother, I instantly felt weird. The workers all had fake and bratty \""smiles\"" on their faces, and a few of them gave me dirty looks!! Really?!\nI was walking around on my own, when looking at the lipsticks I was waiting a few minutes for assistance. When the woman came to help me, she was very short with me and said \""Let me see how much that is. That is 20 dollars.\"" 20 dollars for a tiny tube of lipstick , people. \nShe directed me to the cheap part of the store with the 2 dollar lipsticks, rudely saying \""Here's the stuff that you can afford.\""  Thinking that was what I was looking for since I am a teenager... Okay then.\nI felt awkward, shy, and just wanted to huddle down and leave. The woman that \""helped\"" kept looking at me suspiciously, and it was creepy. \nAlso, the condition of the restroom was UNACCEPTABLE. Filty toilets covered in disease packed stuff and floors full of DIRT, it was just horrifying. \nI WILL NEVER RETURN TO ULTA. One of the WORST experiences I have ever had at a store, quite possibly the absolute worst."
3857	0	a	"I know it's the holidays but the store was understaffed. Obviously that's not the staff's fault, it's managements. It took me about 13 minutes to get through the line. We were backed up to the facial cleansers aisle. Also the price signs are so difficult to read I think if they made them more obvious you'd know the price you're paying for something. Because I unfortunately thought I was buying an $18 product when it was $50. Big difference due to the poor placement of the price. It was on the \""amazing concealer\"" product. It was the applicator brush that was 18 and the 3 oz was 24 and the 5 oz was $48. I checked after I purchased it and waited in line forever I just accepted it. I won't be back."
3858	0	a	Worst Ulta I've ever been to. The person working at benefits brow is racist! She knew I had an appointment and was waiting right by the counter for almost an hour, I did not get any greeting or even acknowledgement for my presence. She continued on chatting with the girl she had on the chair and taking her time. It was clear she did not want to serve me. I've been going to benefits brow for two years now and go every month. This is by far the worst I've experienced. It's like they opened up another branch and put the worst staff in there! I doubt this branch will make much money given their service level now
3859	0	a	Worst service EVER! Watch out for Bianco she will snap at you every chance she gets. She needs someone to teach her the basics of customer service!!  Run!! Stay away!  Other staff was pleasant.
3860	1	a	The almond croissant was far better than average. Combine the coffee with the croissant for a little bit of heaven. All at a reasonable price.
3861	0	a	I saw a Dunkin Donuts worker carrying a tray of donuts.  When she tilted the tray and lost a donut, she picked it up and put it back on the tray and took it to serve to people in the casino.  Not only nasty but potentially a definite health risk!  Never touch a donut there again.  I gave one star because the app would not allow zero.
3862	1	a	Are you kidding me Teharu has opened down the block from me. Did someone plan to make me go broke or something? This place has plates no more than 2 bucks a pop and the variety on the conveyor belt is great! My favorite restaurant!
3863	1	a	Saw that it had finally opened! Not as big as the other location, but I feel as if the sushi is slightly better. The inside is very beautiful with the etched glass dividers and granite-y countertops. A great place to go for a cheap, quick lunch.
3864	1	a	This place was great! My mom and I went for a late lunch today. I found it because I was looking for a place near the Mesa airport. Great find!! The sushi was so fresh and tasted amazing. My favorites were the crunch roll and the California roll! Highly recommend this place. The staff was very friendly as well. They need to open one on the Westside now!
3865	1	a	Had a great dinner! Just had the Cali roll and pot stickers. Overall the Sushi rolls looked very good. Our server was very nice however they only had two at the time of dinner. I will be back for sure
3866	0	a	Update 11/15: I spoke with one of the employees at the Chandler location. Turns out this Mesa location is co-owner by the one that owns the Scottsdale one and the one that owns the Chandler one. They decided to go with the Scottsdale location's pricing and sushi style/sizes... which I hope changes. I personally believe one of the big reasons the Chandler location does so well and is always packed and has regulars is because the prices and portions cannot be beat. If this Teharu wants to stand out from the other sushi places locally, pricing would be the way to go.\n\n----\n\nI've been to all three Teharu locations. This one is the least appealing to me overall, by far. The only thing this location outdoes the other three on is atmosphere. \n\nLet me start off by saying I visit the other location in Chandler twice a week. It's close to my work, the portions are great, and it has the best pricing by far. I know many of the employees by name, and my coworker and I are treated well every visit.\n\nThat being said... This location pales in comparison when it comes to price and portion. The plates are often $.50 to $1 more expensive than the Chandler location, and the portions are almost half of what I would get as well. \n\nThe food was cold when it shouldn't have been... cold tempura shrimp rolls just aren't the same... have you had soggy tempura? It isn't very appetizing, to me anyways. \n\nThe sauces were even different, and not in a good way. The unagi sauce was the most disappointing. It tasted like they grabbed some soy sauce and tried to water it down with just a little eel sauce... too salty!\n\nPros: Closer to my house by about 20 miles, great atmosphere, good service (until there are more than five tables seated), and informative staff.\n\nCons: Smaller meals (so you have to eat more, and therefore spend more), higher prices (again, spending more), sauces are lacking, and food that isn't fresh enough.\n\nOverall, I won't go out of my way to go back. I spent the same amount of money as I would have going to a regular sushi bar that would have served fresh food and given me a free miso soup and salad. \n\nThat being said, I will give Teharu a second and third chance when it picks up business and gets its big kid wings, maybe things will change.
3867	1	a	Simple!  Yummy!  Good variety on the sushi conveyor belt and menu.  Some unique rolls like Haru Popper, Mountain Potato Roll, and crispy onions on top of a CA roll.  Affordable and fun!  And I could order a roll without avocado (due to my food allergy).  Good music, TV on the wall, sake and beer selection looks good.  I'll be back!
3868	1	a	Yummy, cheap, and clean! Love the revolving bar too! My husband and I end up going here almost every date night just because we love it so much. And we've tried other sushi places, they don't compare!
3869	1	a	I'll start by saying I've never been to a sushi joint that serves sushi on conveyor belts and honestly I was a little nervous about going. However, I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of fish served here. There aren't any crazy extravagant rolls but they do have a few that are quite good and there nigiri is fricken awesome. I mainly just eat different types of nigiri when I come here and leave very satisfied. It's also super cheap! Definitely recommend.
3870	0	a	If i could give this place negative stars I would.  We have been going to Taharu for years at the Tempe location and never had issues. Apperantly this must be the red headed step child because the service is bad... Walked in when it was dead at 2 pm it's 314 pm and still don't have my order that I placed. I flagged down the server to have her tell me she doesn't know what happened to my order but if I want I can pull from the bar I could do so. The whole point of using the order form was because what I wanted wasn't on the bar.  No refills on drinks even after asking,  Horrible service. If I come back it will be the Tempe location since they don't leave you hanging for an hour and then loose your order.
3871	1	a	My favorite sushi place to go.  If you don't see it, you ask them to make it.  I read all the reviews and the bad reviews were so sad.  I haven't EVER and I have been here about 40+ times...had bad service.  Always filling up the water, getting more wasabi...\n\nMy grandchildren didn't like sushi and my son in law calls sushi a bait shop...they come back when they are in the area.  I want you to know that that is something else.  We are going tonight as soon as they show up.  \n\nI especially like the menu items...getting fried calamari.  If I have extra I take it home and warm it up.  It still is great.
3872	1	a	"I used to go to the Chandler location a lot but after a while I stopped going... the quality seemed to go don't at that location... but I was still excited to try this new location.\n\nFor some reason, everytime I go there, the place is empty... but that's not necessarily a bad thing (less wait time yassssss) \n\nLove the fact that I can try different types of rolls but not have to eat 8 pieces of it...and its really fun watching the sushi move a long the belt\n\nMy faves include the Vegas Roll, \""boobie roll\"" not sure what it is called for real lol but it's the one with the red dot, And the Rainbow roll! Yummy!!\n\nYou can order more specialized stuff on the menu but may not be on the belt.\n\nFor dessert there's random cheesecakes and cream puffs that go around and other drinks as well ( I personalky focus onthe sushi)\n\nAnyways... Prices are pretty affordable from 1-2 dollars per plate... But it does add up!\n\nGo and try anyways! It's fun and yummy :)"
3873	1	a	This is a new restaurant that is located very close to work so we had to try it out for lunch. It's a little difficult to get to and when we walked in the decor was a bit odd but the food is really good!! I ordered the candy chicken and my friend the curry chicken. They both had the right amount of spice and very flavorful. The employees were also very friendly. I am definitely going back because I want to try the Pho. Oh and they are very reasonably priced.
3874	1	a	I am a return Peace Corps volunteer from Thailand, which, for better or worse, has made me a Thai food snob. I had the Thai basil stir fry (pat gra-pap) and the drunken noodles (pat kee-Mao). Both were very delicious and when I asked the owner for Thai style she made sure to spice it up with Thai chillies (prik kee nuu). They both had the perfect balance of spiciness, saltiness and sweetness that you should expect from Thai food. The food was very reasonably priced and the owner/cook was out taking to the patrons which made it an overall great experience.
3875	1	a	Peanut Chicken was delicious!\nMy wife's Yellow Curry Beef was too hot but it was tasty....next time we'll know to request mild.
3876	0	a	"I stopped in for lunch to check out this new pizza place. Mark Rich's NY Pizza and Pasta used to be here. I recognized the girl at the register when I walked in, so I asked her if they just changed the name, but she said that Mark Rich's recipes transferred over when the new owners bought the business in this location. Mark Rich's NY Pizza and Pasta still currently operates another location, using the same recipes and ingredients, but has nothing at all to do with Giani's NY Pizza and Pasta.\n\nI ordered the lunch special for $5.95 which was 2 slices of cheese pizza and a drink. The pizza slices were a good size. I didn't care for the pizza though. They might be using the same recipe the previous owner used, but it doesn't mean it comes out the same and it just didn't for me. The pizza was somewhat burnt and had a stale taste to it like maybe it was from the day before. This is a real disappointment for me because I regularly shop in the shopping center Giani's is in and enjoyed stopping for pizza. Good thing \""Above the Crust\"" is just around the corner though on Ann Rd so there still is a solid pizza joint in the neighborhood I can go to."
3877	0	a	Terrible pizza. If I tossed it at the wall it just might have shattered it was so hard and stale. I asked the girl who helped me what happened to the pizza place that was here before and she rolled her eyes and said that they sold the business along with the recipes to them and even though it's new owners and a new name the pizza would taste the same. She made me feel like I was bothering her and came off very rude. I do feel the price at around $6 is fair for 2 slices of pizza and a drink but it needs to be edible. I couldn't make it through just 1 of the slices because it was so tough on my gums to eat. Maybe they should try some of their own recipes if they have any. With other solid pie joints nearby I'll pass on this place in the future.
3878	0	a	This place was great when it was called Mark Rich's NY Pizza.  The new place has gone way downhill.  I used to love their pizza, but now it's way below average.  I used to drive miles out of my way to eat here, but no more.  It's just not the same.  The staff changed and I guess they changed cooks.
3879	1	a	This place just opened up near the salon that I work at and let me tell you, it Is AMAZING. They have a delicious corn fake crusted French toast, I doused mine in syrup, so so good. They also make a great bacon cheeseburger, I mean, big bun, thick crisp bacon, yummy crispy fries, the whole nine yards. Their menu is also HUGE with a massive selection of a variety of pancakes, kind of like babystacks. Funfetti pancakes anyone?! I can't wait to go back!
3880	0	a	Ordered eggs Benedict.  No hollandaise was made so that eliminated that choice \nOrdered simple scrambled eggs with diced ham and was excited to see they offer hash browns. Order came gross!  Don't call these slimy potatoes hash browns. Ham was gristly  \nThey have a five year old helping by buttering toast gross! \nAnd the banquette is not padded most uncomfortable.  Will never go back
3881	1	a	We were lucky to find this place. The food portions are huge and it tastes great. I ordered lunch and my wife was able to get breakfast. The staff is very attentive and friendly. The drinks never went dry and the food was served hot and fast. If you are in the area I highly recommend stopping in for a bite. I wish there were more stars to give.
3882	1	a	Place is very delicious portions are very reasonable, prices are reasonable also overall I fell in love staff was great!
3883	1	a	"My wife and I just had breakfast at \""bite\""... A new breakfast and lunch place on Grand Canyon (4165). There was a coupon in the R-J for a buy one get one free, and I usually use those to try new places or old favorites. We had not been to bite before so decided to try it. Absolutely awesome! Great selection, excellent food delivered to your table quickly, and really really great service. I recommend this restaurant to anyone!"
3884	0	a	"Items Selected:\nBottomless Coffee\nBEER CAKES - Guinness beer batter with crispy smoked Applewood bacon pieces\nBITE'S ULTIMATE PANCAKES - Fresh egg surrounded by our buttermilk pancake batter filled with bacon and sausage pieces\nMONTE CRISTO FRENCH TOAST - Turkey, ham fried egg & Swiss cheese\nFUNFETTI PANCAKES - Cake batter with rainbow sprinkles and topped with yogurt (...or not, bro)\nCHOCOLATE MOCHA WAFFLE - Whipped cream and chocolate fudge\nMINT CHOCOLATE CHIP PANCAKE - Minty green pancake batter, loaded with chocolate chips and topped with whipped cream and chocolate fudge\nBANANA NUT FRENCH TOAST - Homemade banana nut bread dipped into our French toast egg batter, grilled and topped with sliced bananas\n\nReplacing the shuttered Sun City Caf\u00e9, Bite quickly garnered attention when I discovered it was less than ten minutes from home and giving the restaurant a few weeks to get its footing before paying a visit with three friends the simple conclusion is that either they still haven't figured it out, or perhaps that they never will.\n\nLocated in a strip mall, pretty standard for Las Vegas, Bite is the invention of Chef Andrey Ariza and having personally contacted the restaurant weeks prior to find the website and menu (and subsequently linking it to their urbanspoon, yelp, and foursquare accounts) the first tip-off regarding customer service occurred when their online question form went unanswered and finding similarly disinterested staff located in store suffice it to say that those who drink their coffee quickly should sit close enough to the back of the restaurant to fill their own - the bottomless cup of $2.85 brew admittedly good, though the temperature could have stood to be turned up a few degrees.\n\nPleasantly decorated for Christmas, with a small kitchen and at least three line cooks manning the fryers and grills, it was with football in the background that an order was placed and requesting the food in two rounds the items rolled out at a good pace - the mistaken substitution of pancakes for French Toast one flaw, while the 'funfetti' stack was served without yogurt as though no one would notice - a later excuse of \""we just replaced it with butter, \""sorry 'bout that bro\"" apparently felt to be service-recovery enough.\n\nSpeaking to the quality of the food, much like the rest of Bite it was a bit of a mixed bag, the first round of savories honestly proving superior to the second set of sweets with the Monte Cristo fairly well constructed despite being unfried while the \""Ultimate\"" was interesting if only for the runny eggs at the center, though this also contributed to a substantial degree of sogginess when taking into account the somewhat greasy sausage, the Beer Cakes surprisingly my favorite plate with light hoppiness and a crispy griddled layer overlying a fluffy center that paired nicely with smoky bacon.\n\nTransitioning to more childish delicacies after a bit of respite, and a couple of trips to the coffee machine as the restaurant began to fill, 09:10:11 on 12/13/14 arrived just after unordered banana pancakes and funfetti pancakes lacking the menu-promised yogurt arrived and returning the first while settling for flavors no different than average white bread in the other it was in the crispy chocolate waffle and a single $3 mint flapjack that we indulged, both decent but nothing to write home about, while the late arriving Banana Nut French Toast was admittedly quite good, a crispy topcoat overlying a pudding like center with plenty of bananas made all the better by a drizzle of warm maple syrup.\n\nStunningly unapologetic for serving items without the toppings promised on the menu and mostly underwhelming in their execution of plates that sound far more interesting than they taste one of my dining companions summed Bite up best when she said that it seemed they were trying to capitalize on the success of BabyStacks, but with four of them already populating a valley with plenty of competition from EggWorks, The Cracked Egg, Blueberry Hill, Hash House, and so many others that offer a better overall experience I'm not really sure Bite offers any good reason to go back."
3885	1	a	How has this place gone unnoticed? A Friend suggested I try it I went there today and had the biscuits and gravy and it was so good I haven't stopped craving them all day.  My friends had the pancakes and loved them.  This is by far my new favorite breakfast spot!  A must try! The staff was very friendly.
3886	1	a	I was impressed with the unagi and the servers and chefs were very friendly. Will be coming back often.
3887	0	a	"We were so glad to see a sushi restaurant in downtown Las Vegas. The atmosphere was very pleasing. However, the service did not match. It took us about 15 minutes to receive our first dish (a few pieces of nigiri sushi). After receiving many dishes, such as the yellowtail yuzu ceviche and screaming orgasm, we thought to ourselves \""what was our favorite dish?\"" and we couldn't think of it. This place has potential, but the server did not know much about the product she was selling. This place needs some help if it is going to survive. Le Thai will definitely be funding this to stay open for the next year (since it apparently is the same owners)."
3888	1	a	Bocho is proof that great restaurants exist outside of the strip! Looking for amazing food and want to get away from all the craziness on the strip? You've found your restaurant! Want your traditional sushi bar experience? Take a seat on one of the stools downstairs. Want something more intimate? There's tables upstairs with a bartender on duty!\n\nThis gem is a great combination of everything you could look for in a restaurant. Great service, amazing food&drinks, and the best atmosphere (totally hipster). The sushi and appetizers are on point (we're from LA, a land of great sushi restaurants, and we give this place two thumbs up!) My girlfriends and I came here for one of my bachelorette party dinners, and we had an awesome time. Alex, the manager and his staff were attentive and the food came out in a timely manner.\n\nWe'll definitely be coming back and I would recommend this place to everyone and anyone!
3889	1	a	"The latest gem to grace Downtown is located at 6th & Carson. Bocho Sushi was born from an idea sparked by Dan Coughlin (Le Thai), backed by DTP and saw to fruition by Jimmy & Becky Chun (recently shuttered Tokyo Japanese Restaurant). The Chun's are at the helm, they are no strangers to day-to-day operations after running their restaurant in Commercial Center for decades. At two weeks new, Bocho Sushi has already reached hotspot status by serving up some delicious eats in a cozy setting. \n\nOur friends invited us to dinner, upon our arrival, every seat in the house was taken. Downstairs you'll find the sushi bar with counter seating, and upstairs there is intimate seating and large bar. The space has an industrial feel, but I love when old buildings are spruced up and repurposed. The changes to the old Carson hotel have been top notch. This block was once forgotten, but now? It's alive and well. \n\nThe menu will meet all of your sushi and sashimi loving needs. Plus, there is an omakase offering for those seeking an adventurous experience. Sake, beer and cocktails are free flowing. They have not yet begun serving wine, however. We started with orders of Edamame ($3.50) and the Jalapeno Bomb ($5.95). The bomb was \""bomb\"" (har), seriously, though, it was delicious. It is hard to go wrong with deep fried jalapeno with spicy tuna and cream cheese. Unfortunately, the Edamame was late to show. It served as dessert. \n\nA smorgasbord of rolls and sashimi followed: Yellowtail Lover ($9.95), Tiger Roll ($11.95), China Roll ($11.95), Spider Crab Roll ($12.95), Yellowtail Yuzu Ceviche ($11.99), Salmon Sashimi ($6.25). The were all well executed. The fish was delicately sliced and extremely fresh. My personal favorites were the Yellowtail Yuzu Ceviche with serranos and spicy garlic ponzu, and the China Roll with shrimp tempura and spicy tuna. Both selections were bursting with flavor. \n\nThe staff was warm and friendly and our servers were patient & attentive, the only flaw seems to be with timing. I'm confident that they will get that resolved in time. It always takes a new restaurant a bit to find their rhythm. Bocho is currently open for dinner, but lunch service is scheduled to begin next week."
3890	1	a	We stopped in unexpectedly. And we're glad we did. Immediately upon entry we were greeted by all the guys on the sushi line and all the guests at the bar. It felt like Cheers only we had never been here before. :)\n\nSo we sat down and started with standards like edamame, shishito peppers, spicy tuna and a Philadelphia roll. Everything was great and we were happy to see a great sushi place now available downtown. \n\nWhen we thought we were done some gifts from the kitchen came out like grilled king oyster mushrooms and tuna tostada. A great way to finish our meal and a nice way to make us feel special on our first visit. \n\nHeads up. Jimmy the chef likes to drink. Buy him one and you find you are the recipient of some gifts from the kitchen too. \n\nComing back and sending people their way.
3891	1	a	I took several of our agents and staff here for lunch. We were all stunned at the beautiful presentation. I wish I'd taken a photo - we were all surprised and delighted when our large order came presented in a bowl (except for the rolls). Everything was very fresh, and each dish was perfect. We all loved the Bocho Roll and the Spider Roll, as well as the Super White and the Unagi. I can't wait until my next visit; I'm taking a group of 10 on the 4th.
3892	1	a	So excited to have a sushi spot downtown and it's so yummy!  Bocho special roll was so tasty, definitely a favorite.  The sauce is a garlic ponzu and it's a good size. One will fill you up for lunch.  We also did a lunch box which was pretty good. The pickled cucumber was a good touch as well as the seasoning on the rice.\n\nThe service was great, everyone super friendly.  \n\nWill definitely be coming back and taking friends and family.  They don't have dessert yet so excited to see what they come up with!
3893	1	a	Delicious, fresh and reasonable. The service\nWas awesome and the sushi Devine. You have to try their version of a jalape\u00f1o popper, stuffed with cream cheese and fish with a delicious sauce on top.
3894	1	a	Seconds, anyone? Just had dinner with a group of friends here last night, and everyone was happy with the service and the food. Again, everything was so fresh. I have to go back and sit at the sushi bar next time!
3895	1	a	Exceptionally fresh, high quality sushi with an inviting yet edgy atmosphere. This is a fantastic place.  Best new sushi bar & bar in Vegas.  Yellowtail Ceviche & the Jalapeno Bomb are two unique and incredibly tasty items.  Tried Banzai Bunny Blueberry Sake because of the picture and let's just say... worth the cab fare!  The staff was efficient and friendly, the bartender is my new best friend (as I recall, Lol!)  They've got an separate upstairs bar for cocktail hour and I'm told they're opening Karaoke rooms next week!  In a word... Fabulous!  I would highly recommend it!!!
3896	1	a	My new favorite sushi spot! \n\nThis place is so cute! I love the inside and the staff is very friendly. It has two stories. The bottom floor is a long sushi bar with several chairs. I did not see the upstairs but there is additional seating. \n\nThe chairs at the bar are awkward and really squeaky. It was odd and a little embarrassing trying to get in and out of them because they were so noisy.  The food was absolutely worth the weird chairs. \n\nWe ordered several items including the garlic tuna and three rolls. Everything we tried was fresh and delicious. The service was friendly and the sushi chefs were a great time.\n\nThe restaurant is on the southwest corner of 6th and Carson. The signage is minimal so it's easy to miss it. \n\nI can not wait to return.
3897	0	a	This is worst hotel I have been in Las Vegas. Way overpriced for what it offer. Customer service is non existent. Ricardo who presented him self as the manager needs a training on customer service skills. Check in was a mess. Hidden charges. Rooms are nothing like it was advertised. I booked this hotel a month ago and after waiting 40 minutes to get checked in they gave me what it must be the worst room in the hotel. When I called to request a change the girl on the phone was very rude and lie to me saying there was nothing available. There were at least 50 people waiting to check in. So at least there were 50 rooms still available. Then Ricardo the manager say they will not make any room changes and I will have to keep my room or go somewhere else.  Rooms are small and with poor terminations.  This is a 2 star hotel at the most.  Don't come here
3898	0	a	I got pushed here from the flamingo for a night. Even though it's free don't do it. Pay to go elsewhere.  Service was terrible. Check in was forever long and there was no expedite for total reward tiers.
3899	0	a	This hotel is everything wrong with Vegas. Long waits, terrible customer service, and unfulfilled promises await you.\n\nFrom check in you'll experience the unmanaged lines, long check in, and lies. We were told we could check in at noon if we were a total rewards member. When we came back at 2pm, we were told it was only IF rooms were available. As a side note, a friend checked in 7 hours later and received a note and t shirt saying they were the first guests in the room, meaning the room was available all day.\n\nWhen we game back to check in at 4 pm, we were told rooms wouldn't be available for another hour. We waited and returned at 5. After waiting in the check in line for 30 min we finally got our room. We then had to endure 20 min on hold with the bell desk waiting for our bags. Finally I went downstairs, through the stairs because only 3 working elevators serve the entire hotel, to go to the bell desk myself. After requesting my bags, I watched two people behind me in line get their bags bags first.\n\nAfter rushing to get ready, we went downstairs to get a cab to make a 7pm show. There were NO cabs available. The valet tried to sell us on their in house limo service for only $65 to get to NYNY. He assured us it would be the same price as a cab. Luckily a cab showed up and took us to NYNY for $11. \n\nOverall, if you can get a room for under $50, the linq isn't terrible. However, it is in no way a quality hotel and should be avoided if you have the choice.
3900	0	a	Rude uncaring staff at this place. I can understand why this hotel company as not made a profit in 6 years. I would have guessed a monkey is in charge with no idea what he is doing! \n\nThe first issue was I booked a room with 2 queen beds and was given a room with 2 doubles. The room is tiny and reminds me of a college dorm room.  I called the front desk and was told that's the way it is now. Great service!\n\nThe second issue was checking in.  They have no lines you just stand someplace in front of the desk and hope to be next. People are all over wondering what to do. \n\nThe third issue was only 3 elevators work in the whole building. The place normally has 11 elevators so imagine the wait times. Each time we dared to go to the room it was a 20 minute wait each way. \n\nThe 4th problem I had was they did away with platinum members checking in VIP.  It's an inconvenience and slap in the face to people that spend thousands at this property to get a benefit taken away.\n\nI forgot the swimming pool is also closed due to remodel but they don't tell you till they get your money.
3901	0	a	One of the worst hotels that wasn't a 1-2 star I've been to in a bit.  \n\nGood:the bars, sports books, and casino are all top of the line.  \n\nBad: I had to check my bag until 4 pm because they didn't have any rooms.  I was ok with that.  When I came back to get my bag, the lady took my ticket and stood there for 7 minutes.  She easily could've gotten the bag but kept calling back and no one was picking up.  Finally someone went and got the bag.  \n\nI was here for two nights.  I get back at 4 pm to take a nap, and my room wasn't made.  I call, they said they would fix it immediately.  I go out, come back at 7:30 pm.  Still wasn't made at all. \n\nI go down to talk to the manager.  They initially say they will wave one days resort fee.  I said hell no. They eventually waived both.  \n\nJust know this is effectively a one star hotel in a great place.\n\nForgot to add.  Only one working elevator.
3902	0	a	I can't even give them 1 star as this place is horrible.  First, they give us a handicapped room, but that wasn't the big problem.  The problem is that this is the old Imperial Palace and the rooms aren't finished.  So our room had garbage in it, the lights in the bathroom did not work, the shower water flowed throughout the bathroom, the sink was stuck, there was no black out shade.  So we call the front desk, they tell us to come down and they will get us a different room.  We pack our stuff go down to find out that they won't release the room and it's clear they have another but refuse to give it to us and send us back to the room.  We were supposed to get another room the next day only to find out that all rooms on the 16th floor are not finished and do not have black out shades.  They designate a new room give us the room number and tada we go to switch to find out they gave it to someone else and put us back on the crappy 16th floor.  Plus, the elevator to the 16th floor wasn't working. That definitely was not acceptable.  Finally, they put us on the 9th floor the evening before we check out.  If that's not bad enough, our stay came with 2 tixs for the Linq High Roller and they told us we get $5 off.  Had we not been paying attention we would have paid for something already included.  We will never stay at this place again.
3903	0	a	The ride is so boring.  You can technically book a hotel room facing the strip and request for the room at the top of their building and have the same view for probably cheaper.  Whatever you do, don't purchase the VIP package, especially by using Travelzoo's coupon code.  Terrible deal ( http://www.travelzoo.com/entertainment/las-vegas/-63-High-Roller-VIP-Ride-Package-for-Two-1871376/?conf=1&cm=signedin&source=_tzlock&placement=Overlay-TravelDeal-DealPage-SignUpFP5), especially if you are going to ride this ride before 7pm (day time cut off) since the day pass is only 24.99$/per person (that's 50$ for 2 instead of 63$ for two) If you're thinking that it comes with free drinks and photos with this package, it doesn't.  They made me pay for those things and when I told them that my ticket and this thing says it's complimentary, they told me to contact Travelzoo or Linq's itself.  I will post pictures later to show you the receipt I paid for for the extra items listed here. You're basically paying for more to ride this boring ride and for the coupons.  Oh, and also, that deal from Travelzoo can only be purchased on a computer and not a mobile device--I didn't know that so wasted so much time calling them (they kept bouncing me around from one to another, from Linq's itself and Travelzoo agents, instead of just telling me that) and trying to enter it with different Internet browser as they advised it. And when I did it on a computer, Linq's website was down, so I didn't know that it would only work with a computer till I had my friend test it out for me a few days later while I was on the road driving to Vegas.  Seriously, save your money and go ziplining or ride on their roller coasters or do a tour or something there instead. Oh, btw, they do have a parking structure next to it, but it's closed off, so you'll have to park at Flamingo or on the street.
3904	0	a	The worst experience of my life!! Had originally booked Friday and Saturday, but then decided to head out a day early and booked a separate night. We didn't get in till late on Thursday so I knew the king bed wasn't going to happen. But the double beds were Fulls not Queens and the room was tiny. The next morning we went down to get our other reservation with the king bed and it was a constant run around. We were told to come back in an hour. An hour later we called down and we were told it was ready, so we went down and were told there was nothing available. This happened 3 more times!! Finally at 4pm, check in time, we got in line and everyone was being told no rooms were available. Lots of people were very upset, we still went up to the lady that told us to come back at 4pm and finally they had it for us, but the lady was very rude about it. They didn't even apologize, not once. I will never return to this hotel. \n\nThere is more bad:\nExtremely important the door wasn't sound proof, you could see a gap under each door, and everything could be heard from the hallway, so sleeping wasn't easy. \nThere was construction on the pool the whole day Friday. \nElevators only 2 were working. \nParking structure is dirty and not safe. Lots of construction still going on. \nShower had no pressure. \nNo blackout curtains, light came in thru the sides. No clock in the room. \nSome ice machines weren't working, as well as vending machines. \nCellphone service was horrible in the building.\nHad the Do Not Disturb sign on the door, and housekeeping knocked two different times!! \n\nThe good:\nThere is a refrigerator in the room, but not that cold.\nBeds were new, since they had just opened the hotel.\nLocation, since its across the street from Caesars and the new promenade is very nice.
3905	0	a	This is probably the worst hotel I've ever stayed at. If there were negative star reviews on Yelp I would click there for my rating. \n\nStayed here during the official opening this past weekend (10/31-11/2) for my friend's Bachelorette Party. My friend had 3 non-smoking rooms reserved in advance, and specifically requested that one room be located closest to elevators for me since I recently had foot surgery and it would be difficult for me to walk far to get to my room. \nWhen I checked in, I found out that my room may have well been in a completely different hotel since it was so far out of the way from the ONLY WORKING ELEVATORS in the building (yes, apparently the hotel was not as ready to open as they should have been). My room was in fact near a set of elevators...elevators that were not in service the entire weekend. \n\nWhen I asked to have my room moved closer to the main (Working) elevators, I was told that the hotel was full and no rooms were available, but to check with the front desk between 11am and 1pm the next day to request another room. I called the front desk at 11am and was told it was to early for them to tell if a room would be available and to check back at 2pm. I went to the front desk between 2:30 and 3pm and the lady at the desk told me that she would reserve a room for me but it wouldn't be available until after 4pm or 5. I watched her write a room number on a key card case and put it aside. I went to dinner and returned to the front desk at 6pm. \n\nThe woman at the front desk, Joana (different lady than before) had no idea what I was talking about, and said she didn't see any rooms listed under my name. She told me that the hotel was full and there weren't any rooms available. I told her of my many attempts to change rooms (due to THEIR mistake of putting my room next to non-working elevators), and she said she needed to speak with the manager. She left me waiting at the front desk for nearly 20 min (while I was standing in pain on my injured foot) only to return and tell me that she still couldn't put me in another room. \n\nAt this point I was extremely upset and requested to speak with a manager, whom I then had to repeat everything and now inform HIM of the situation. He rudely repeated what the woman said about no rooms being available. I (in a raised voice by this point) had to remind him of my disability (foot injury) and the fact that I had not even mentioned the loose screws and parts on the floor of my room, and that he would regret denying an injured/disabled person access to a room near a working elevator, especially since I am an Elite Yelper and also reviewer on many travel sites. FINALLY, he decided to move me in a new room. I am still extremely disappointed that I had to yell and get that upset for them to correct their initial mistake and move me to another room. \n\nWhen I finally reached my new room, it was still not close to the main elevators, but much closer than my previous room. Walking down the hall to my room, I noticed cigarette smoke but thought it was just in the air from being on peoples clothing...when I got settled, I soon noticed the smoke was seeping into the room thru the vents and under the doors. Apparently I was in a SMOKING room, even though I specifically told the woman who changed my room that I wanted a NON-smoking room. I am usually able to tolerate cigarette smoke but this was horrible and I had difficulty breathing and sleeping. The cigarette smoke throughout the lobby on the way to the hotel rooms is also ridiculously strong...you would think that if the hotel was renovating, one of the first things they would do is invest in a better filtration system.\n\nDuring our stay, we came across many things that shouldn't have been, simply because the hotel wasn't together. While the decor of the room was nice, clean and modern (fixtures & furniture), there were loose screws, bolts and random metal pieces around the floor of our room (as I mentioned earlier), the bathroom fan didn't work & there were no manuals, maps, menus or anything about the hotel or room service anywhere in the room, no clocks, double room beds were full not queen, hotel pool was still under construction, etc. There was a soda/ water vending machine on my floor next to the ice machine, and when I went to buy water (there isn't a gift shop or store in the hotel), the vending machine was not working. I ended up having to drink tap water. Also, when I called to request a late check out on Sunday, I was told that they were not granting late check-out that weekend since it was a soft opening weekend. \n\nSeriously, don't stay here. Stay anywhere else...
3906	0	a	I'm a Las Vegas local, and I love staying at new hotels on the strip! But I also stay pretty often when I have guests in town. And if I can summarize the lengthy review below, I would say: SAVE YOURSELF. DO NOT STAY HERE.\n\nFirstly, when I made the reservation, I added my friend's name to the room so that she can check in when she arrived in town as I finished my work day. They did not let her check in. So instead, she had to leave her bags at bell hop and wander. **STRIKE ONE: INEXPERIENCED STAFF**. I called to complain and when she tried to check in again, they finally gave her a room key. When she got to her room, she was surprised to find that the front desk had given her a key to a room that was already occupied!! There were belongings of other people all over the room. And even though no one was there, this is bad! **STRIKE TWO: SECURITY BREECH**. \n\nWhen she finally changed her room and got her own, she requested that the room be next to mine (as I had reserved both rooms). They told her they will try to get it conjoined but can't make guarantees. Um hello, none of the rooms at this hotel even conjoin, so I have no idea what they were talking about.\n\nSecondly, the elevators at this hotel are horrendous. Apparently there is another set somewhere that is not yet operational, but every time we had to use the elevator to get to the rooms, it would be a horrendous wait. There were always about 20 people waiting to get on, and it seemed like only ONE elevator worked! This backfired because when we tried to check out on Sunday, it was a 30 minute wait to finally get down! What we ended up doing was we got on an elevator going UP. Then rode it all the way back down. During our decent, we stopped on every floor. And every floor, there were VERY unhappy people waiting to check out. **STRIKE THREE: HORRIBLE ELEVATORS - YOU WILL BE TRAPPED**\n\nThirdly, there was a resort fee of $20/night and there is no resort here! The beautiful pool on the hotel website is fake. The pool is not done yet. There is no wifi. And even though I did not check the fitness center, I would be surprised if that was done too! When we complained about the report fee, they were only willing to take off ONE night. **STRIKE FOUR: CHEATING FEES**. \n\nFourth, when we tried to hail a taxi, it was always a 5-10 minute wait. Does the staff actually call a taxi to come get you? I have no idea.. **STRIKE FIVE: TAXIS DON'T COME HERE**\n\nFifth, sometime during my stay, my key stopped working. Okay fine, not a big deal, but when the elevators are this bad it's an extra 40 minutes to do a simple key change! I was so annoyed. Also, their key doesn't go into the slot. You're supposed to just waive it at the door. I don't know about you, but I think these keys could be easily hacked. I didn't feel safe here. **STRIKE SIX: SAFETY CONCERNS (AGAIN)**. \n\nLater that day, as I was waiting in my room for my friends to meet me, security guards came up to the room and asked for identification. They had no reason to check on me except.. maybe when my key was deactivated, they had accidentally given the room to someone else, just like the issue my friend ran into. So they probably had to send security up to make sure the people in the room were actually supposed to be there. **STRIKE SEVEN: SECURITY CONCERNS**.\n\nAnd the nightmare is not yet over! The charges that are pending on the credit card have not yet finalized, so I have no idea if the hotel had overcharged for my rooms. If the pending charges go through, then they more than doubled the charges they were supposed to charge when I booked the room. Then we're going to have a real problem when I complain. **STRIKE EIGHT: CHEATING CHARGES (AGAIN)**\n\nActually, I think there were more issues with this hotel than I can possibly mention. Given that it's their opening weekend, maybe I should cut them some slack. But in reality, I had high expectations for this hotel. It's at a prime location, at the entrance of the new and popular Quad.. and it just failed.. miserably. The concerns I have are beyond just aesthetic appeal.. we have real inconveniences and real security issues here. I might stay one more time months from now to see how things progress.. but if they continue on this slope, I will NEVER stay here again. I will warn all my friends, all my family.. and just hope that new management takes over.\n\nMy fellow yelpers, please stay away!
3907	0	a	"Ok so first of all ... Let me start with this was my birthday weekend ... I was SO excited to get to stay at a brand new (renovated) hotel - the first in a clean, gorgeous room with a killer view! Well ... Ha! Let me start with our arrival, we were there for 4 days, 3 nights so we parked in self park, thinking that the entrance doors pretty much lead you into the Linq. 20 mins later, lugging so much crap, we find the actual lobby/ casino ... After going through at least 5 construction zones and up and down stair wells as the elevators were either under construction or broken. We find check in - hurray! Staff was AMAZING! Loved every one we came across! Up to our room we go ... So excited for my high roller view room ... Yewww! Wait. Is that a parking garage??? Um yup. That's my birthday weekend view. And it looked like a car almost flew threw it. Wrong room, wrong view. We went out, partied, came back and fell asleep. Comfy bed, slept great! Woke up and I don't think there was room service (bummer - I like breakfast in bed), at least we didn't have a menu so we left and enjoyed ourselves. The elevators were broken 75% of the time. The shower \""design\"" (only half was covered with a glass wall) there was a bar for curtain but maybe that was just for looks i'm not sure but what I do know is that all the shower water ended up on the bathroom floor ... Not cool. No taxis but that wasn't a huge deal for us. High roller wheel was AMAZING. Our fridge was broken. Not good circulation/ ventilation in the room. They said no coolers were allowed in the room, we never experienced this issue in our past 15+ Vegas trips. Note again the fridge didn't work. Loved the location! The shopping plaza was awesome. This hotel has potential but it was very disappointing for such a special birthday weekend. 2 stars but that's MAINLY for the staff we came across and the high roller wheel happy hour ;)"
3908	0	a	"The casino is fine.  They did a decent job upgrading it from the Imperial Palace...  well, I'm reviewing Linq and Quad as the same thing, because really they are.  They have a great video poker bar inside with 100's of beers from around the world.  If it wasn't for that, I'd probably never come here.\n\nTheir parking garage is a living hell.  It's old and should have been torn down and rebuilt with the rest of IP.  It took my friend and I like 20 minutes to get up the 6 floors due to difficult corners to turn at and lots of cars coming in and out.  Then on the 6th floor, the parking garage just ends with no warning, and there's nowhere to turn around and go back down.  Any cars queued behind you all need to back up to give you room to do a 17-point turn.\n\n100% the worst garage in Vegas, and I've pretty much been in them all.  Told a security guard that while stuck in line.  His response? \""I work here, I know it.\""  How many accidents will we have to see before they fix this place?  Shame on you, Caesars."
3909	1	a	Newer, casino to the strip! Theyre still renovating this casino so there is alot of construction heading in from the parking garage. the entrance from the lot to the casino is a little confusing,  they need more directional signs. \nThe slots and tables are great and the drink service is fast! They have runners just taking orders and within 5 min the waitress is back with your beverage! !\nthe security is AMAZING!  Shout to security guys CRAIG and KEVIN Q (manager). My phone died while playing the slots, and I asked them for a charge place for my phone, only to realize I had left the charger in the car! They both went and found me a charger to use., and then stuck around to make sure I had a sufficient charger that worked....excellent service!  MADE MY Trip!!! I  good customer service.  Great job guys, ill be back!!!
3910	0	a	"I checked in at 6:00 PM, not very late especially for Vegas. The person at the front desk they would have to try and find me a room. \""Try and find me a room\"" I booked the room three weeks ago, don't find me a room, give me the room I booked! \n\nAfter 20 minutes they put me in a room with two fulls instead of a king, no big deal. However, my view was straight into a building next door with construction going on. I woke up to a guy standing on a latter right outside my window, hammering a wall!\n\nThe photos on their website make it look like a hip new spot that got a legit remodel. This is not the case. The remodel was done cheaply. The photos do not show you that there is no closet. There is also no coffee maker. I had to pay $14 for really slow wifi.\nThere was also a fire-alarm running out of batteries somewhere near-bye so I had to hear a chirp every ten minutes."
3911	1	a	Okay, we're here.  Yep you're right no upgrades we're in a room overlooking the parking lot. We're going to try again tomorrow. But the room is clean. Small, very small but clean. And we have a huge new flat screen TV.  Hubby and I wanted a king room and got two fulls (really? They still make full size beds?) but is fine not a deal breaker.   I'm a little upset about the no upgrade because we are Rewards Members and always get them but I'm thinking maybe there aren't any suites yet available. They did however give us $75.00 in food and drink credit and free tickets for the High Roller to make up for the no upgrade.  The High Roller tickets are expensivworking. Someone said they don't give you soap so we brought our own soaps we usually do but there is a nice assortment in our bathroom, including the little bar of face soap on the vanity.  The Casino is fun we played a little video poker at the bar and I win a nice jackpot at the slots. It's a small casino which I love you don't have to search for your travel mates!  I'm with my Dad and he said he's meet me in front desk and voila he was there!  You try looking for an elderly parent with no phone.  \n\nI would recommend this hotel.  The absolute best location if you like wandering around and the customer service is great everyone is helpful and I have seen nothing these reviewers have experienced.  And my wifi works fine! No problems but I don't do any work on my phone I just post yelp reviews :)\n I truly do not understand the negative reviews this place\n\nWhy is it so important to have an ice chest when you have a fridge in your room free of charge?  And just so you know, not many hotels offer coffee makers anymore \n\nI bring my own I've always been weirded out by the room coffee makers. People can do stuff to them...enough said okay?  \n\nPet friendly I kind of get.  If you are passing through town but why would you want to bring your guys and what would you do with them while you are out enjoying Vegas?  Leave them in the room?  \n\nKeep them with family or a trusted caregiver...dogs do not care about Vegas.  \n\nLastly this hotel is under renovations.  Give them a chance...geez LINQ I have really stepped up to the plate for you....I should get some kind of perk.  :)\n\nDid I enjoy my trip yes I did!  Will I stay here again?  Probably not and ONLY because there are no tubs here.  And I associate my Vegas trips with long tub afternoons with my hubby and relaxation...so PH is my place I love those tubs maybe in the future LINQ can include some tub suites.  Otherwise...I was very happy and yes I loved that bar 3535?  Whatever I love our stay there.  They try hard.  Give them a chance, have a blast and stop complaining about things that don't matter. The Linq is trying to make good.  Of what I don't know because I really did like the IP.  And oh btw...I am a long time Vegas Tripper...Yard House is not part of the LInQ Hotel it is on the Linq promenade...shouldn't take points away for that..of course you won't be comped by the hotel it is not part of it...Why am I so protective of this place?  I don't know but I think the reviews are unfair.  This place is nice...\n\nHave a blast.
3912	1	a	I stayed here the second weekend it was open as the LING Hotel.  Yes, it is newly renovated.  It just opened as the LINQ on 10/30 so if you are reading the reviews and they say the rooms are old, it's not the same place.\n\nThe room has a clean, IKEA kind of look to it.  Younger feel and nicely decorated.  The room has  fridge, not common in Vegas, so that is a nice touch.  We were on the second floor overlooking the pool which is under construction.  No view but I'm not sitting in my room looking out the window anyway. I  could have upgraded to a High Roller view but not worth it for me.\n\nThe check in went flawlessly.  Elevators have been redone.  They are not the same IP elevators, which I would have rather taken there stairs then go in the Imperial Palace elevators.\n\nFavorite part is the 3535 bar downstairs.  Great bartenders.  Great drinks and reasonable prices.\n\nRead between the lines on these reviews.  Yes, it is under construction.  Yes, the views are not the best.  Location cannot be beat.  I had excellent service.  You are not paying for a suite at Caesars so don't expect it.  But overall comfortable and very happy with my stay.  Will stay here again!
3913	0	a	"If I could, this place would not get\nANY stars. We finally get to Vegas and the front desk lady kept telling us how we are the very few people to rent out the new hotel out of hundreds of rooms. So we asked if we can get an upgrade and she said no everything is full. Okay? Didn't you just say we are one of the few people to rent these new rooms during this week? Moving on, we get to the room and it's ridiculously small. It's renovated and looks new but as I was checking the restroom (I like to wipe down restrooms with antibacterial wipes due to my OCD) the toilet is stained no matter how many times you flush it. The Linq is supposed to be renovated but they can't clean toilets?! Plus, no complimentary lotions, no alarm clocks, no coffee maker.. Cover sheets are cheap. The list goes on. This is a hotel that I wish I never stayed at. \n\nAND, don't ever use their valet. We forgot some sunglasses in the car and when we got our car back it was gone. So yes, someone stole them. Yes I know not to leave any important items in the car.. But sometimes people do forget and it really sucks that you can't even trust their valet at a \""new\"" hotel for a few minutes. Therefore, I wish I never stayed at the Linq. I really advise anyone not to stay here. The worst hotel I've stayed at in Vegas."
3914	0	a	"Extremely disappointed! I booked a three night stay at this place in August after visiting and seeing the hotel to be what appeared as almost finished. I came back in November to see things like Guy's restaurant condensed to half the seating, the daiquiri bar gone! And upon booking my stay I had requested a non smoking room. I later realized Linq offered pet friendly rooms. I called several times to inquire a room which was pet friendly. The day before my check in the front desk confirmed there would be no pet friendly rooms available. Fine, I paid $200 and left my fur babies at the pet hotel. Upon arriving to Las Vegas I was told the non smoking rooms were first come first serve and that I had the option of a smoking room or ... A pet friendly room. \""Pet friendly  room?\"" I asked \""yes\"" the front desk girl says. I became visibly saddened and irritated after driving 6 1/2 hours to here my dogs could have came and I waisted $200 extra dollars on top of what would already be an expensive weekend. Ok so we settled for the pet friendly room and The Linq hotel offered to remove all resort fees (as there are no resort amenities anyways) and they offered $75 food and beverage credit for the obvious disappointment. I was instructed by a front desk employee and her manager \""eat anywhere besides Hash House A GoGo and charge it to the room\"" ok so the next day my husband, friend and I go to the Yard House, successfully charge $80 of food and beverages to our room at Linq. Happy customers. I went to check out today and was given grief because we chose to eat at the Yard House, as it was not a part of the Linq hotel. Well then why could I charge the meal to my room? Either way the front desk girl was able to speak with another manager and appeared to handle the charges. I left with a credit card receipt for $5. Later that day after returning home I check my credit card statement to see several additional charges for resort fees and a $75 food purchase! Overall the whole place is a mess, the parking structure is horrendous and I would never opt to stay here again..."
3915	0	a	"We arrived yesterday..... FALSE ADVERTISING....... Room was dirty, only 1 elevator working, no hand soap, no comps or upgrades, NO COFFEE in room, no coupons, they \""upgraded\"" us to the high roller ferris wheel view.....well its a parking lot with a somewhat view of the the ferris wheel. Then they gave us an other room closer to the elevator, with \""no  view\"" ...but the view of was better. \nROOM SERVICE: ha it's a joke......its all from the restaurant upstairs but ONLY from 6am to 1 am so if you are out till 1:30 you are out of luck, and you are not allowed to order in ......but you can buy outside and bring it in. HUMMM? \nDO NOT RECOMMEND"
3916	0	a	Booked my room through their deal with the Rock n Roll marathon and got a great price. Room was decent, nothing special. \n\nIf you go make sure they are done with their construction, which they clearly aren't now. Casino and lobby are a mess. Construction work started right outside our window at 5 am. Nothing like getting some sleep.\n\nWhen we complained at check out, we were offered our resort fee of $16.80 back yet the couple in front of us was given $50 off their bill for the same complaint. Front desk staff wasn't very friendly. \n\nBottom line, won't be returning.
3917	0	a	Still have a lot of kinks to work out here. Loud construction at 7am. Customer service hit or miss... Mostly miss. The drink girls were terrible on the weekends. The dealers were very inexperienced. However, it was a cheap room that was decent and the promenade connected to the hotel is awesome. I'll try again in a year or so and see if it is any better.
3918	0	a	Talk about putting lipstick on a pig. They think a fresh coat of paint to make this event a new hotel that can compete with the others. Still The dump that it was before. They also don't let you bring an ice chest to your room which was a pain as we had to unpack our stuff and bring it up in a bag. Tons of construction still. Parking is also not convenient. I would go to any other hotel before this one.
3919	0	a	"So... the casino half of this Hotel & Casino is great. (Relatively) cheap gambling, great bars, nice atmosphere. I'd come play here any time.\n\nBut the hotel half? Yikes. Recently \""remodeled,\"" but clearly still inferior to just about everything around. The biggest difference between pre-renovation and post-renovation seems to be the price. \n\nThere is an required $25 resort fee, which is the norm now for Vegas, but to offset that you get \""high speed internet access\"" (normally $14 a day) for \""free.\"" The thing is, \""high speed internet access\"" is about 0.5 Mbps down. But that's okay, for just $20ish more dollars a day, you can speed speeds TEN TIMES AS FAST! ...5 Mbps down. I get that there are lots of guests and many who would like to connect to the wifi, but including WiFi in the resort fee and then THROTTLING it in an effort to make more money is just dirty.\n\nSeriously, I would get faster speeds by tethering my phone and connecting to the LTE it provides. Except... There is no cell coverage. Like, barely 3G speeds. And at first I thought \""Gee, maybe it's just T-Mobile?\"" Except I am here with friends that have both AT&T and Verizon. And here's another weird thing: all of us have full coverage everywhere except here. On the 14th floor of a newly remodeled \""resort\"" on the Las Vegas Strip. \n\nSo we can't use our phones, and the WiFi is unusable (unless we fork over even more cash). This is 2014, and a situation like this is insulting. Holding usable speeds at ransom is despicable.\n\nThe room itself is fine for what it is: a small, basic room. It's a bed to sleep in, a TV to watch, and a shower to wash up in. 300ish feet, a few new-looking fixtures, and a C+ view. At least the A/C is cold. I wouldn't mind hanging out here if I could DO anything while I was here, but at this point I can't even receive phone calls. \n\nDo yourself a favor and only stay here if it is absolutely necessary, or if you don't plan on being in your room at all and just need a bed to land in at the end of the night. The effort put into the recent remodel is appreciated, but at this point the price has gone up to the point that the difference between this and a better casino nearby is negligible and well worth the extra cost."
3920	0	a	Our stay here was decent, but I don't think we would stay here again.  I was running the rock n roll half marathon so I was thrilled how closely the hotel was located in relation to the finish line, and that was the main draw.  \nWe took the airport shuttle and our driver told us the hotel does not have a designated drop off area for shuttles so we had to be dropped at Harrah's and walk our bags over to the hotel which was a pain.  There were also no real signs directing you from Harrah's.  \nWe knew there was still construction happening so we specifically asked to be in a room that wouldn't have construction views or noise.  Well, we were placed right outside the construction and there was a chute right outside our window that chunks of concrete and building debris were thrown down.  It woke us up at around 7:30-8 on Monday morning and was so loud we were startled out of bed thinking it was an earthquake or something.   \nThere still seemed like other things that weren't completely finished.  The toilet ran for hours after being flushed and there was no info book in our room to reference for check out times, etc.  \nThe location was nice, close to the promenade, Starbucks, monorail, etc.  That's the main advantage I would say.
3921	0	a	A potential to become a decent hotel but not close to even being there as of 11/25/2014. I would suggest travelers to consider other options for the Vegas lodging at least until Spring 2015. We stayed in a Deluxe King. The followings are the positive, area of improvements and unacceptable conditions:\n\nPositive:\n1) Centralize location in the heart of the Vegas Strip and LinQ Promenade\n2) Customer service have improved from previous reviews during the opening of the Hotel (10/30/2014)\n3) Room is modern and fairly spacious.\n4) Strong pressurized water flow for the shower\n\nArea of Improvements:\n1) Quality Control, review of hotel rooms, and system synchronization:\n     - Example: registration system indicate a King bedroom but once we went to the respective room the room was 2 full size\n2)  Lack of attention for the House Service team:\n     - Missing Alarm Clock, bath robes, Ipod Stereo , which are all listed in the hotel website.  \n     - Body Wash, Shampoo, Conditioner were all empty during our stay. Isn't it in the cleaning process to refill each time? \n3) Blackout curtains does not cover the entire window. Sun will shine through in the morning. \n4)  Minimal amenities a basic hotel may offer:\n      - Front desk indicated Body Lotion is not provided\n      - No Desk lamp but there are bed lamps\n\nUnacceptable conditions:\n1) Expect to hear construction work and LOUD noises starting @ 7am each day!\n     - Constant work noise and earthquake like vibrations\n\nAdjust your expectation accordingly if you are consider staying at the LinQ Hotel in 2014. A potential to become a decent hotel but not close to even being there as of 11/25/2014.
3922	0	a	"I'm sure this place is a work in progress but it should have been torn down. The rooms are very small and modern. Not a fan if having the a/c blow right on me at night either. Parking is not much fun. I would not stay here again.\n\nEdit:\n\nStayed there again to \""give them a chance\"" it was even worse this time. I had more interactions with the staff at all levels and was not impressed. Most of the staff seems to not have a clue what they are doing, even the Vip office. I know for sure I will never set foot in this place again."
3923	0	a	Only giving one star as this place was a wreck! I booked rooms prior to opening so there were no reviews when I booked. The front desk people are unbelievably rude and refuse to assist or take care of the customer. Really really bad. Ran out of toilet paper and called down to house keeping seven times... Never received it... Construction is constant and loud! Never should have opened with that kind of work going on. And employees need to be trained to be better accommodating. They have tons of nasty attitude!
3924	1	a	I booked our room at The Linq a few months before their opening. On our drive up to Vegas I made the mistake of checking out reviews online. I was a little worried until I realized that the majority of the reviews were about construction and the parking garage.\n\nWe occupied a deluxe King room in tower 3, 12th floor and were very happy with the accommodations: 1) The room was beautifully decorated and spacious, 2) The bed was wonderful, 3) The marble shower had a rainfall shower head and there was plenty of room on the sink top for our toiletries, 4) The clothes storage was open to avoid nasty bed bugs that come along with the usual arrangement, 5) Plenty of room to stow our luggage and 6) a small desk to keep up on work if needed.\n\nOver the years we have stayed at many other hotels on and off the Strip. This is the first hotel that we will return to.

The resort fee is $28.00 a day...!\nIs it because, MGM Grands's resort fee are Aria, Bellagio, Delano, Mandalay Bay, MGM Grand, The Mirage, Vdara, The Signature at MGM Grand: from $28...?\nAnd top of that Caesars Entertainment properties (except for Ceasear Palace) resort fee include spas and fitness centers \nBut, at Linq there is no spa and the all exercise machines are old the room was very small ones still  at the old property..\nI don't know why I paid top resort fee but not get all the advantages is supoose to come with...!\nBut only thing your get is wifi for two devices..!\nOnly reason we stayed was this was new remodeled property, anyway...!\nEverything else was still kind of nice though..!
3927	1	a	The Linq has been renovated and looks like a decent hotel now. The interior has been updated nicely with marble floors and new carpets. It has come a long way from the historic imperial palace. The exterior has also been painted brining new life to what was a a very dated property. With the addition of the Quad Area, including the High Roller, retail shops and restaurants, this has become the happening place to be at during the daytime and also night. Caesars Entertainment has made substantial investments throughout the strip and it is finally attracting more patrons... It's just a shame that they may soon file for BK as they no longer have cash flow to continue operations and interest payments through 2015. I would hope they sell their properties to people that will continue their progress in maintaining Las Vegas Boulevard.!!!
3928	0	a	"The last time I step foot here was when it was the Imperial Palace. The Imperial Palace changed its name to The Quad, and  then added a new section called The Linq. \n\nThere's probably 15 floors but don't think its a small hotel.  It streeeeeetches to 1000's of rooms per floor.   My room was 30858.. not sure what the 30 means, but we were on the 8th floor with the view of the \""High Roller\"" attraction.  Literally, folks, my room was looking AT the attraction, and we had to walk 1/4 mile to get to our room.\n\nSlapping a new coat of paint, and adding updated furniture helped the Imperial Palace, but in the end, its still the god awful Imperial Palace, with the small shoebox of a room.  Even housekeeping had not improved.  On our first day, housekeeping forgot to give us a complete set of towels and bottled water.  The second day, she forgot tissue.  \n\nElevators are slow, and rooms are minimalistic, where you get 1 chair for the entire room.  No coffee maker, and I think the glasses they gave us were used, and just wiped down.\n\nThe only positive part is it was free, and they paid me to stay there. \nSorry but never again.  Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me again by calling it the Linq.. shame on me!\n\nWe got Stephen's mom a free room next door at the Flamingo (which is supposed to be lower in ranking) and her room beat our room hands down.  She even got a coffee maker!"
3929	0	a	If I could give half of a star I would. First off, they told us the construction was complete, not so. We checked in on Thursday (4 rooms in our group) and had asked when the reservation was made for adjoining rooms. We were told at check in that they didn't offer them. The rooms are small, but you don't really need large one in vegas. Decorated ok, bathrooms tiny. Small shower, one sink and toilet, not enough room for 2 people to be in at the same time. At 8am Friday morning we woke up to beeping and metal scraping noises out our window.  There was construction being done, and some idiot put the truck in reverse, left the vehicle on with the back up warnings on. The banging and scraping noises were them cutting off the concrete balconies, and sending them into a metal chute into the metal dumpsters. It sounded like a war zone. We complained, and they moved us to a room that had an adjoining room, after they told us they didn't have them on the property. While brushing my teeth in the bathroom, I could hear clear as day the man in the next room peeing. Super thin walls! They don't have a buffet,  you have to go next door to the flamingo. A very disappointing hotel.  They pretty much put paint on with minimal upgrades and the are promoting the heck out of it, which I have no clue why. There are much nicer properties in vegas,  they just need to implode this one and start fresh. Also, I held 2 of the rooms on my credit card, they said when my group checked in they would charge theirs.  Well, true to form, they messed that up too, now I have to ask my friends for the money because they can't handle simple reservations. Also, no black out curtains, and the ones they do have don't close all of the way so light comes in super bright. No clock or coffee maker either. Cute little fridge though. They seem to have issues with getting enough taxis on the property.
3930	0	a	IF YOU HAVE A RESERVATION HERE, CANCEL IT NOW. The positives (there are many).  Friendly and professional parking valet, front desk staff, bell men and housekeepers.  Quick, easy check-in.  Nice, remodeled rooms.  Comfortable beds.  Good location on the strip adjacent to the Linq Promenade.  The negative.  CONSTRUCTION NOISE.  It is very loud.  My wife and I wore ear plugs and the construction noise was still very loud (we always travel with ear plugs).  It's a loud, constant, pounding noise.  We were unable to sleep once it started at about 6:30 a.m.  It's significant.  Come back when the remodel is complete because this property has a lot of positives.  It is only half complete at this point according to the staff.  My 2 cents.
3931	0	a	Terrible hotel.  I usually spend 50+ nights a year in a hotel and this is easily the worst experience I have had in years.  We originally were given a room overlooking about 10 dumpsters on the 3rd floor and asked to move so we wouldn't be woken up early by the trash truck.  We moved to the 19th floor.  6:30 am construction of some sort started directly above us.  After several calls to the front desk and GM the noise is still going on at 9am almost non stop on the floor above us.  I would equate it too trying to sleep directly below a bowling alley.  Chairs and furniture are being drug across the floor almost non stop.  I am checking out a day early, this is just unacceptable.  I could have gotten more sleep with a mattress on the strip.  The shops at the linq are nice, lots to do, the hotel has been a nightmare experience.
3932	0	a	My main issue with this place is the noise because it's still undergoing construction.  One of the main reasons I came to Vegas was to relax and catch up on sleep since I have a 1 year old and he never sleeps in.  Construction started at about 6:30 am and even though I was on the 18th floor the windows did a poor job of trying to muffle the noise.  They offered to switch us across the hall, but I opted out because if the noise travels up 18 floors I doubt walking across the hall would make much of a difference. I get the fact that when you're in Vegas you should be on the move out and about,  but there were times during the day I wanted to take a nap and was not able because it was so annoyingly loud!!!! The fact that I wasn't able to sleep passed 6:30 am because that's when construction started kills me.  If I wanted to wake up at 6:30 am I would have stayed home. A hotel that you can't sleep in is about as pointless as a rental car you can't drive. It just ends up being a huge waste of money.  I am only giving them 2 stars for customer service since we received a credit for 1 day of their resort fee charge.  If you value sleep don't stay here.
3933	0	a	"The worst experience hotel I even had in Las Vegas!! I wish I would give negative!! I come Vegas twice per year and always enjoyed the hotel and food here. Knowing LINQ just grand opening and the location was pretty good, so I want give it try. Pro: the location is good and room is pretty new. Con: the room is pretty small, especially the bathroom, tiny, with small standing shower. The room is good for one person, if you have two people, will be crowed. Also, the room is very simple, doesn't feel comfortable or won't make you feel you spend time in the room (maybe the reason they decorate like that is to make you feel spend more time on gambling). \nHOWEVER, the worst part: customer service in frond desk. is terrible!!!! I booked 4 night king bed room with view (paid $10 more for each night), my mom came first (arrive on wed night), and stay 3 night and I came sat for one night. When I arrive, I see the two small bed. My mom said when she checked in, they told her no king bed room available, and put her in two small bed room. Are you kidding??? Room booked out on wed?? Ok, but I saw so many empty room when I walked to elevator (maybe the guest just check out).  I went to frond desk and asked why my mom get two single bed room. The woman Janine, terrible woman, don't know how she can work at frond desk. very bad manner, and said it in very mean way \""we never guarantee to give what room you booked on line\"". I told her but we booked king bed, if you don't have king bed room available, you can give other option, such as upgrade or change the room when the king bed room is available. She said \""no king bedroom available in hotel\""\uff0cFace impression you can leave if you don't like the hotel. When I asked really? Then I don't want to live here. Another girl at front desk (very friendly) and said, oh yes, we have king bedroom available but with no view. Hotel should give the option when they don't have the view room available, right? I take the king bedroom without view and ask them to refund me the room difference. (From began to end, Janine didn't smile and didn't apologize, and she is trying to tell you she has the right to put any guest at any room at her preference). I am not sure if they will since I still haven't checked out yet. So upset  to write the review in room. won't spend any penny hereI and won't stay here ever never again! also booked couple room for CES in jan 2015 for the company, will go ahead to cancel on Monday. No wonder the review is so low for the new hotel."
3934	0	a	WTF kind of hotel parking is this?!   You go underground but the valet was closed.  So I self parked and walked around in circles because there are no signs. Then I found my way out to where the Linq High Roller is and asked them where the hotel was...and they said that I needed to go into O'Shea's Casino.  What a pain in the a$$.
3935	0	a	Currently staying here and I literally can't even. Our room was comped, but I definitely won't be back, nor do I recommend this hotel to anyone.\n\nIt's still under construction so there's that. The parking structure is super sketchy. It's not well lit and it's confusing as heck to get in to. I'm from Long Beach, and our structures are nicer than this. What the heck.\nWe had our room comp email and brought it to the front desk lady who told us that we had to book the room online and then come back. Basically she was saying she cannot even do her job which is to book rooms.\nI don't get cell service in here except for maybe in 5 minute pockets.\nFor the room:\nThe room is small, there isn't a coffee maker, the bathroom door doesn't close all the way, the channel selection sucks, and our view is of the sketch parking structure. We didn't pay for anything and I feel jipped.\n\nGo anywhere else. There are a million places to go on the strip
3936	0	a	Grumpy staff, mediocre casino, and there is some fucking construction going on. It starts at 7:00 am like it is necessary and it does not stop until everyone in the hotel is awake early. I will not come back ever again.
3937	0	a	Staying at Linq for the holidays. Since 6:30-7 am they are doing some sort of construction. Non stop noise and banging. This place is not relaxing at all. Vegas, you stay out so late and when you want to relax, the stupid construction won't allow you. We called guest services,they transferred me twice and third time after being on hold for 7 minutes, I talked to some one and requested a manager to come to our floor and hear this noise. He apologized and said we give you $50 credit in food n beverage. I said this credit is not going to help me relax. Keep the credit and get rid of this noise. He said oh, they are not suppose to do construction this early but I guess because of holidays. After all noise remained the same and they suggested we change our room. Insane holidays at LINQ.
3938	1	a	I walked down here to see how this casino looked and where it was. Apparently it replaced the Quad and is a huge improvement. It's a classier looking casino that features the High Roller: an enormous ferris wheel that has provides seating for a unique dining experience. The stores outside between Harrah's and the Quad is now between the Linq and the Flamingo.
3939	0	a	"I wish that I could give a rating in a negative amount of stars. This place is an absolute shit hole with the worst customer service I have ever encountered in my life. I would not stay here again even if they paid me to. \n\nI looked on Yelp before I made the reservation here. Since most of the complaints and bad ratings seemed due to the construction at the time, I called the front desk to make sure that construction would be completed by the time of our arrival. I woke up to the sound of construction this morning. I work in construction so usually things like that don't bother me too much, it is just one of those things that has to be done. However, I am not talking about some guys hanging from scaffolding and banging hammers. I am talking about heavy equipment and large peices of metal being banged around first thing in the morning.  I'm really not sure what they're doing out there, but from the sound of it I would guess that they are errecting an actual sized replica of the statue of liberty. \n\nWhen we first arrived and could finally check into our room, completely exhausted after traveling way too early in the morning, we were absolutely disgusted. Not only are the pictures online taken at angles that make them seem a LOT larger than their actual size, but our room was dirty. The carpet had not been vacuumed, there was hair on the bathroom floor, stains on the pillowcases, and some absolutely disgusting I-don't-want-to-know-what on the side of the bed frame. \nWhen I called down to the front desk to inform them of our problems, the woman who answered spent 10 minutes arguing with me before she sent up the housekeeping manager. I was informed that the person who told me that construction would be finished had been wrong and maybe I had called the wrong number because NO ONE there would have EVER said that. Then I was informed that these rooms were just gutted and remodeled, so there was NO WAY that there were stains on any of the pillowcases or that the room was as dirty as I said, but she would send the housekeeping manager up to check. Apparently the motto \""The customer is always right\"" has been replaced here by \""Blame it all on the customer\"". \n\nAfter the housekeeping manager came up, saw the room and fed us some story about a trainee cleaning it, we were offered a different room. Not a nicer room for all of our trouble, just a different room. With a worse view. The manager comped our \""resort fee\"" for the three day stay (amounting to a whopping $70 savings). (I'm not entirely sure what the resort fee is for in the first place, since half of the amenities listed on their website seem to not exist.) At this point we asked if we could just get a refund and go to another hotel, or even just to transfer to another property owned by the same company. Apparently since we booked through Travelocity, that was not an option. We called them, they were rude and less helpful than the hotel, but I'll save that for another review. \n\nSo now here we are. Being held hostage in one of the crappiest hotel rooms I have ever had the displeasure of staying in, because no one can seem to figure out how to give us a refund, or an upgrade, or a transfer.  The room is about the size of a shoebox, with no windows that open to the outside. I'm not usually claustrophobic,  but I pretty much want to crawl out of my skin while laying here and I have a stuffy nose from the lack of fresh air. There is absolutely no insulation in the walls. I just listened to my neighbor pee. Also got to listen to him having sex last night. I feel like maybe I have to buy him a drink now or something. The \""remodel\"" that they spoke of was a piss poor attempt at a lackluster cosmetic makeover and the bed is about as comfortable as passing out on a stack of newspapers. And there is no coffee maker. FOR THE LOVE OF ALL THAT IS HOLY, WHY WOULD YOU LEAVE HUNGOVER PEOPLE WITHOUT COFFEE IN THE MORNING?????? \n\nI could continue,  but if you have read this far and still have any desire to stay here, then you are just dumb enough to deserve to stay here.\n\nPS- The neighbor just peed again. I have to know that, so now you do too. I'm really hoping to be dressed and gone before he has to poop."
3940	0	a	You can rename and put lipstick on a Pig, but the fact is its still a PIG. Look at the 600+ reviews on their previous business page for The Quad Las Vegas Resort & Casino. It tells the story. They may have remodeled part of it but the fact is their management team is less than stellar and their housekeeping is atrocious. Watch out for unadvertised extra fees and credit card hold charges without advanced authorization. Its one thing if they actually cared and tried to learn from reviews and customer complaints but the fact is they just dont care. If negative reviews existed, this hotel would be the poster child...
3941	0	a	"WARNING!!! This is IMPERIAL PALACE, NOT a new hotel as they may lead you to believe!!!\n\nWith that being said, I don't even know where to begin with the flipping list of complaints and how the IP duped and hijacked our vacation from the start......\n\nNo cell phone service= no data or communication as you please.....esp if you are ATT....\nTherefore you MUST pay 20$ a nite for the worlds worst internet service.....and can ONLY connect 2 items (phone, com, iPad, etc). Downloading ANYTHING is strictly forbidden and closely monitored= no Netflix, cannot order food, play ur games normally, etc.....\n\nConstruction= me SUPER annoyed during my Vegas vampire hours (starts at 6am). If u complain about this, they will ONLY offer to move u to another tower that is the old IP staunch.......ewwwwwwww\n\n\nRoom service? I think NOT, ONLY from 6:30 am to 1:30 pm.....unbelievable \n\nHungry and happen to want food outside that miserable time slot, then get dressed, or stay n ur Jammie's as I did, and be prepared to go hunting for your food= spending more $ at the flipping IP YOU did'nt even want to b at.....gettn pissed now!!!\n\nI wanted to order food from a service, but IP specifically c\u20acck-blocked that effort too......so now, ur hungover, sleep deprived, no room service, and gotta get ur lazy ass up to spend some more $$$ at this sht-hole.....food / effort / patience alone will cost u more than ur 3 nights here.........\n\nWant to complain or speak to the manager? Prepare yourself.......seriously, because this guys strategy of dealing with unhappy people as myself and my friends will only make ur temperature rise........really high.

3943	0	a	"Just some quick thoughts on my stay at the \""new\"" Linq Hotel & Casino, a place I will highly not recommend.\n\nFront desk staff was the worst of my stay - and my first impression. Here are a few things that set my entire New Year's Holiday week off in the wrong direction:\n\n1 The registration desk was fairly small and no clear signs on where Platinum (or higher) members were to go to take their advantage of their membership.\n\n2 I attempted to check in early and was immediately told it wasn't available. Understandable, but asked to check in anyways and be contacted when available like I have been in 3-4 of the other Caesars properties. I was looked at like that has never been done before and was denied. \""Just come back at 1PM and see what we have available,\"" she said.\n\n3 When I went back at the requested time, I asked for a strip view. Granted, they weren't completed with remodeling, but instead of a courtesy \""I'm sorry, those rooms aren't available,\"" I got a very defensive response: \""Ha! No, we have no rooms on that side.\"" Then I asked for as high up as possible and smoking and was interrupted with a \""No. All smoking rooms are ONLY on the 7th floor.\""\n\n4 Then I was told I had to put down $200 deposit for my complimentary room. This is common for whenever I stay at the Caesars properties. I never want to do this and request that do not charge me and I will handle all room charges on my own. The clerk and I went back and forth on this until she called the manager over. I advised Caesars Palace never does this to me, and he said they were two different properties. I advised, same company to which he threatened to cancel my reservation! Having no choice, I accepted the $200 deposit. (Which, by the way, was not meant for room charges as I learned later when trying to use some of that. It was just some blank deposit that took more than 2 days to be returned to me - as of writing this review, I have not received my deposit back.)\n\nI might be paranoid, but in retaliation from my objections at the front desk, I got the absolute worst room available with construction outside that was so loud, it rattled my window beginning at 6AM and ending pretty late in the day. (I should've been told, or at minimum apologized for, the construction would be both very loud and begun at 6AM. At times, I couldn't even hear my TV thanks to the rattling outside.) Not to mention the view was horrible.\n\nThe room itself was average, at best. The window was not tinted, so everyone could look into other people's rooms and the place was hyper small with an air conditioner from a Motel 6 and a not-so-comfortable bed. \n\nAlso, the smoking room had no ash tray, no lotion, small bathroom, TV with no visible plug-ins and I could hear everything in the adjoining rooms and hallway. Overall, it was, in fact, the Motel 6 equivalent of the other Caesars properties. I got the room comped from my play at Caesars, but for the price I saw online, my jaw dropped on how this was barely worth $29/night.\n\nThe only positives about the place were the staff outside the front desk and the shampoo/conditioner/body wash dispensers in the shower were very nice. But, the first impression and the highly mediocre room will have me never stepping foot into the establishment any time soon."
3944	0	a	"Oh goodness, where to start...\n\nThe rooms were updated and had a modern theme, but the parking structure was not updated and was as terrible as it used to be when it was Imperial Palace years ago.  Also, there were no clearly marked signs to the hotel entrance once you park in a tight space.  Best way to get in/out of the structure was through Koval.  In/out access during the evening is a bit frustrating.  There are \""traffic controllers\""  that have no idea how to direct traffic. \n\nUpon checking in at registration, it was a bit confusing, they didn't have those crowd/lane control poles; instead there was an actual person directing you to the next attendant.  \n\nWhen using the elevator, there is a security guard in a bright  neon vest that has to see your key card to confirm your are a hotel guest.  It's fine, but the process can be slow if there are lots of people waiting.  Other hotels require hotel guests to swipe their cards in the elevators as confirmation before pressing the floor numbers. \n\nOther reviewers mentioned hearing construction early in the morning.  We stayed (for 2 nights) on the 3rd floor, overlooking the pool renovation, so my fianc\u00e9 and I were a bit concerned.  The first morning we were startled by a loud noise coming from the room next door.  It sounded like someone was hanging something on the wall or what not.  The noise went on for 30 minutes and stopped.\n\nRandomness:  during the first night we stayed, we saw some vomit around the elevator threshold on the third floor.  By the time we left (2 days later), it was still there, but dried up.  Eww.\n\nWe only stayed here because it was close to the Mirage for a cheer competition we were in town for in December.  Our total cost was a little over $200, which is decent for being on the strip. \n\nPros: modern, comfy rooms with plenty of space and outlets. \n\nThere are clearly several areas that require improvement though.  Skipping this place next time."
3945	0	a	Looks can be very deceiving. If I were you, I would invest in another hotel to get your money's worth. They offer wifi, free if you pay for the resort fee but other wise, you would have to pay 14.99 for premium. In order to use the wifi, it only allows two device per room. \n\nWe got the best view.. The Great Wall of China. Literally, you're just looking at a wall. I understand that the hotel is still under construction, but that's still unacceptable. The windows are not tinted either, so anyone can see through your room. \n\nWe ended up getting over charge for using the wifi for having more than one devices. Their wifi is so slow too, it's just not worth it.
3946	0	a	Worst customer service ever. \nHotel front desk agents are nice but the shift supervisor (really old lady with bangs and glasses) was RUDE. wont even let you talk or even try to listen. \nOur hotel reservation was cancelled because we didnt show up before midnight. \nWe've been to bigger hotels and we usually arrive past midnight and we dont have problems checking in. \nWe paid for that room so it should have been guaranteed to us for 24hrs. \nThey got paid double for those rooms (i reserved 2 rooms) that night. The amount we paid and who ever got those rooms. \nWe have to wait until 6pm to finally get a room. \nAnd we have older people in our group. \n\n\nWill never ever recommend this hotel.\nAnd that shift supervisor should learn good customer service if she is working in a hotel. \nRude rude rude old lady. She was saying its hotel policy that we call them before midnight. She can explain that nicely and not talk rudely to people who are tired from travelling. \nNo manners. Telling us to stop talking and listen to what she wanted to say. I think we should have tried to be rude to her too. But we are not that kind of people. \n\nA few people witnessed that encounter and they said she was really rude to us.
3947	0	a	"For the price, it is decent; but, it should be A LOT better. This hotel is a 2 to 2.25 out of 5. The rooms are clean and smell good. The service and staff are hit or miss, being either adequate or border line rude. I do not understand how any hotel could ever treat their guests like they do, let alone a hotel/casino on the LV strip. \n***Side note: They have signs stating that they \""do not\"" allow outside food or beverages and they have security guards at the elevators to ensure you do not bring any coolers in. This lowered my rating 1 point off the bat."
3948	1	a	Finally a Freddy's right near my house! Love their steakburgers & grilled hotdogs. Fries are great too. The best best best frozen custard in the east valley IMO. So delicious! Very friendly staff at all locations and good service. If you've never had a steakburger, try Freddy's first. If you've never tried Freddy's steakburger, what are you waiting for???
3949	1	a	Pros: excellent burgers and I love super skinny fries. ( even though you have to eat them really fast so they don't get cold ) cost for 2 with burgers, fries, onion rings, shake and mini sundae was about 23.00. Pretty good deal. I loved it but my husband preferred 5 guys but I am the one writing the review,   Cons: when we got there at 6 on a Friday night there were 10 or so people in front of us. So we were standing next to booths with people eating. Nothing like a butt in your face while dining ! That is poor restaurant design and should be fixed.  Smashburger does it as well as fuddruckers. So fix this part and you will have a successful place. Loved it!

The only thing thinner than the patty was the fries.\n\nChicago style dog did not fit on the bun and and fell apart while trying to eat.\n\nDo yourself a favor and eat at Five guys around the corner and just come for custard.
3951	0	a	Wow!.. This place is beautiful.  They did a great job on the building the patio and the original Minder Binders. Maybe they are not officially open yet or something but...... No servers on this beautiful patio?. Not sure why they would do that. And not to mention the fact there is only about two tables on the patio right now. And $4 for a can of Miller Light?..that is crazy!. I will have to stick with Four Peaks they know how to do it right. I won't be coming back to the New Minder Binders. Sorry
3952	1	a	"Great food, service and atmosphere! Everyone is so friendly and courteous. The alcohol selection is awesome!! \n\nThey are room rentals for private parties. The patio has plenty of room for a group.

A must stop and see in Tempe!!"
3953	0	a	Below average bar food. This place advertises that they are a restaurant but the menu is limited and the food is terrible. I'm sure it would be fun to come with a group on the weekend but do not come for lunch or dinner. $27 for 2 and I would have rather had the McDonald dollar menu. Service was good and staff was nice though.
3954	1	a	first time in, staff was friendly and the owner dale is awesome! super friendly and genuine. this place is a 5 minute walk from home, I'll be back time and again. thanks for the southern comfort chicken tenders :)

(what did you THINK I would say?)\nThe burgers are incredibly juicy and delicious with a lightly crispy buttered bun. The sweet potato fries even had POWDERED SUGAR on them - just perfect. The barbecue sauce is some of the best I've ever tasted, and the service is top-notch. Even the music is chosen so well, from \""My Girl\"" to \""Hotel California\"" to current music with about 15 minutes in between. Not to mention the deep history and restoration of which inside that building. We walked around exploring it for about 20 minutes after dinner.\n\nStop wondering where you want to eat and just GO HERE! You will not regret it :-)"
3956	0	a	Food was terrible. Do yourself a favor and head 1 block south to four peaks. This place will probably be shut down in 3 months.
3957	0	a	Don't go if you have kids, they don't have high chairs and don't plan to in the future. Food was pretty good, building was cool, but the hostess, waiter and apparently management made it clear that they didn't want it to be a place where you'd bring kids. It seems like they would want families to come given that they were 90% empty on a Tuesday for lunch.
3958	1	a	Skip the hostess station. Didn't seem to care if we stayed or not. Sat at the bar. Staff was great, friendly!  Will come back for food, pizza and burger were really good.
3959	1	a	We celebrated my husbands 60th birthday here with good friends, The service was excellent, the food was Delish. We had a large party and the entire staff was wonderful. The place has so many memories we had a blast and closed the place down at the end of the night.Go Go Go.
3960	1	a	The burgers made fresh daily are great, and the pizza is among the best in the valley.\nNice, cozy atmosphere.
3961	1	a	First time at this brand new establishment. We had a group of ten and were treated very wonderful. It wasn't very busy which surprised us all that some of the rolls took so long to come out, but as soon we notified our waitress she immediately took care of it. The food was amazing and the staff was just as amazing. The music is dancy (it wasn't too loud but if that bothers you it might not make for a good ambiance experience for you) and they have kung foo on tv (awesome). I would definitely hope for this place to thrive.
3962	0	a	"The dumplings were good. The service was sketchy. The featured item in the menu was boxed in the middle of the menu was mushrooms cooked on a 1000f oven. We sent them back. They were not good and not hot. They had a sauce on the outside of them that tasted like cold sweet BBQ sauce. The sushi rolls were tastee but we were given the happy hour menu after happy hour. They didn't have the shrimp and bacon skewer. They didn't have the Anchor Brown beer I ordered. We ordered desert and the guy brought out the snowball and left the serving tray. With all this, as we were leaving and stopped by the bar and I asked what was in the big clear Vats with cantaloupe floating in them. The bar tender's responded \""Cocaine\"" I was like what??? The other bartender quickly ran up and explained it was infused saki. Probably won't go back for a while. Will let them shake out the wrinkles."
3963	1	a	I visted on monday .Like this place a lot I see a lot of potential .Brand new .Cons  I ordered things on the menu the girl came back and I was told sorry we are not offering that item yet . Couldn't order food for a while  just Sushi  which took forever and a day to make it on our table. Pros It is definatley better than when it was extreme sushi. The food was very tasty.Get the Pork belly !The house  drink I had was very good . The ambiance is top notch . Feels like fine dining without $$$$$ prices . Our servers a short brunette and a tall blonde gave great service. The music was good and not too loud . Overall I will be back in due time to try things when the full menu us offered
3964	1	a	Food, decor, service, ambience was perfect! Everything I ordered was good! The resting panda cocktail was light & refreshing. Great quality food & presentation! Definitely coming back for more!
3965	1	a	Amazing, Sexy, Food Porn, Divine Delicious Eats- Just fucking yum!\nFoodGasms Galore!\nCute, super cute people!\nChef Shawn Rocks!
3966	0	a	Small portions. Expensive. Limited menu. Not a single thing for kids/teens to eat. $4 for a kids orange juice. Staff wasn't very friendly. $100 tab and we left hungry.\nNOT FAMILY OR KID FRIENDLY.\nWe won't be back...
3967	1	a	Inviting atmosphere, amazing food, good looking and friendly staff..Lucky Foos exceeded our expectations..I think my Husband and I found our new favorite date night spot..
3968	1	a	This is the type of place that makes you feel like a thousand bucks without actually spending it. The happy hour menu has sushi! I mean what more can you ask for in life? Bartender was awesome! Super trendy spot with good music & such a chill vibe. The original cocktails are a must! You won't regret skipping the beer.
3969	0	a	Mediocrity at its best. \n\nWeird, spotty service. The staff seems snooty already...as if they're already a successful restaurant. \n\nFar from it...\n\nWe stood at the front entrance for a few minutes with no one to greet us before taking matters into our own hands. We walked over to the left side of the restaurant where we saw a group of about five people conversing. They finally took notice and sat us. They continued conversing for the next five minutes until one of them came over to serve us. Again...weird.\n\nWe ordered some happy hour items: wings, tacos, sushi rolls. Nothing had pizazz. Nothing was impressive...very boring and blah. \n\nThat's enough out of me. They didn't want to give me the time of day, so I won't either with a long winded review. Just not impressed. \n\nShould've gone to sushi-mon.
3970	0	a	"This place has decent ambiance and decor, I liked the music playing, and our server was well put together, friendly, and on top of things. So why the two stars? The food is where this place falls flat on its face. \n\nWe went in on a Monday night. There was one other couple seated at a table and a few people at the bar. Other than that, it was a bunch of staff mulling around with nothing to do. Ghost town.\n\nI was starving and ready to hop all over the menu. We got the Warm Root Salad (which wasn't bad, but also wasn't warm), two miso bowls which were just average, and two sushi rolls which were just plain not good. On one roll the rice was very compacted and dry, to the point where it was almost inedible without adding soy sauce, yet somehow the second roll was soggy and mushy. My lady companion is from Hawaii and knows her sushi. She said it tasted like the rolls sat in the fridge all night and then they just topped them with fresh fish, which I have to concur. The mushrooms in our miso bowls were clearly dried and then rehydrated. The quality of ingredients was just underwhelming. \n\nAlso, I ordered a Moscow Mule, which didn't taste bad, but it also didn't taste like it had a drop of alcohol in it. I wasn't going to say anything, but when my server asked how the Mule was, I answered honestly, \""It tastes a little weak...\"" Her response was, \""Oh...I'll have to let the bartender know.\"" But that was it. No offer to remake it, comp it, or anything. $10 for a weak drink is kind of lame. \n\nOur bill was about $60 and I still left a nice tip because our server was nice, but I see no reason to return here. I was still kind of hungry when I left and would have ordered more if the food were better. Maybe it was an off night, but with no customers and very mediocre food, I don't see where all of these great reviews are coming from or how they'll be able to keep their doors open."
3971	0	a	"This is my first time to lucky foo and as an avid foodie and after seeing them on Instagram I wanted to give them try. \n\nFrom walking in it looks like a cool place, modern seating updated fixtures and a chill atmosphere. \n\nWe were allowed to seat ourselves which was fine and wasn't really a problem. The problem was the lack of attention and service that we received. It took at least 10 minutes till someone asked if we had drink orders in yet. And overall all the servers seem uninterested in helping. Working in hospitality I think I just had a higher standard especially for a nice place like this. \nWhen you had as little customers as they had only 5-6 other tables is when servers should be trying to take extra care of their customers not check on them every 15 minutes \n\nI think that if they just went over their manners it would go a long way. A simple please, thank you and your welcome goes a long way. The only server who actually responded to my thank you with a your welcome instead of a k was \""James\"" also the only server to introduce himself \n\n\nThe food is pretty good the miso ramen was the best I would recommend it! The portions are alittle small side \n\nOverall I think that this negative experience  would make me not come back, but I think everyone has off days but overall when you work in the service industry regardless of how you feel you gotta suck it up and put your customers first. Something management should really focus on. \n\nI'll be trying it again in a few months hopefully it'll be better next time"
3972	0	a	So I had high hopes after seeing the pictures online and they continued on when I entered. The place had a fun vibe to it. Cool pop art all over the place, vivid colors.  We were prompt greeted, and given a menu to look at while we waited for a table.  The menu had lots of cool looking fusion items on it and I was so excited.  So we settled on the Hawaiian roll, the fennel role, shirt rib ramen, and the chicken fried rice.\n\n  First thing that came was the ramen it was 12 dollars and about a 3 rd the size of what I would get at monta.  The meat at least was tender good cook on the egg, and the broth had good flavor although a bit too salty. They did give us two extra bowls since we were sharing which I appriciated.  Then the fennel roll came out the rice was so sticky and the peices stuck together.  It was also bland.  Kinda tasted like tuna salad.   The Hawaii roll came out and it tasted like a bland California roll with some mango on it.  These rolls were around 14 dollars. Way to much money for poorly executed rolls.  Then finally the fried rice, way to wet and not harmonious at all.  Just to many things happening without any balance.  \n\nEven though we really didn't enjoy our food nearly enough, the staff was great.  I will say this is not a place to bring a kid, more an adult vibe.  I am tempted to go back just to try the lychee panecotta, but scared of another lovely sounding item not coming together.
3973	1	a	Yay! They finally put a great restaurant in this location! I was a customer twice back in the Extreme Sushi days and that was enough to last me a lifetime. Lucky Foo's is such an upgrade and an awesome new addition to this center. I really love what they did with the place. So much better than before! If you haven't been yet, you should check it out. \n\nAlready they were off to a great start with the major improvement in the atmosphere. Then we ordered and WOW, their menu blew me away too. So many interesting dishes and drinks to choose from. I can't wait to go back and try more! Everything we ordered was great but a few favorites were the Pork Belly Yakitori and the Charred Edamame. That Pork Belly just melts in your mouth. You must try that! I also loved the fact that they had so many choices for Sake. I ordered the House Infused Apple Sake and it was so good that I ordered another. Also worth mentioning... the Caterpillar Roll and Philadelphia Roll but I prefer to recommend things that are unique because you can order these items at any sushi bar. I'll try more of their menu and update this review after I have a few more visits under my belt but for now I was way impressed. \nThey even have this cool app called Rockbot that you can download to choose what music they play. I had fun with that. \n\nAs an extra bonus, there was a familiar face there. Much to my pleasant surprise I was able to locate a chef that I had lost track of named Koong. She's a chick whose sushi game is on point! Now I already know this restaurant knows what's up since they hired her to work here. No wonder I loved my food!\n\nIn closing, I will definitely be back since now it's my mission to become the duchess of Lucky Foo's by getting the most checkins. Excited about my next visit! It's nice to have that feeling after visiting a restaurant for the first time. I need to explore more of their decor since I'm studying interior design. The visual stimulus here was off the chart! I was invited to check out the other rooms but we didn't have time this visit. I will definitely be back for that, plus to hang out more because I really love this place.
3974	0	a	Walking up to the restaurant I did not expect the interior of the place to look as nice as it did. It was a very relaxed atmosphere with a mix of modern-asian decoration. The staff did an excellent job of greeting and helping us find our table for our party to get settled. The real reason for the 2-star rating was the disappointing serving size of the food. I ordered the pork belly ramen and it is truly about 2/3 smaller than your typical serving at other ramen restaurants. The dishes ranged from 15$ and up which is why I expected a much bigger order. The ramen bowl was salty and the flavor could have been more intense. Our table also ordered some cut rolls which actually met expectations.\n\nThe chef came out to our table and introduced the Foo Foo Dogs saying that he invented it and said something like the sauce was made with Tonkatsu..and the hot dogs were sausages from a place in Japan. They didn't taste special. \n\nThe service was great and the people were nice but the food needs to be improved.
3975	0	a	Service was good. The server was nice but clearly didn't have much product knowledge. The food was terrible. We tried the miso ramen and to be frank instant packaged noodles taste better. The rolls were mediocre and the dumplings were soggy. I would not recommend this place.
3976	1	a	Lucky Foos has amazing food and the service was superior. I would recommend going for their happy hour so you can try many items.
3977	1	a	Went in for a quick afternoon lunch we order the tiger roll and really enjoyed it (enjoyed it to much forgot to take a picture). Then ordered a mountain miso soup and I would say it probably won't cross my mind to order it again!\nOverall the experience was good and will probably go back and try a few new things.
3978	1	a	What an awesome place! Warm atmosphere, great food, great hookah and super friendly staff! The owner goes out of his way to make you feel at home!
3979	1	a	Finally a place that serves legitimate Russian Cuisine in Las Vegas.  The Food was delicious. The ambiance of the place was awesome  The price was right.  The  service was spectacular.   The owner (Alex)  went out of his way to make you feel special.  I can see coming back to this place over and over again.   Definitely a must try it out place.
3980	1	a	I have to admit finally it tasted like home, delicious russian food and mediteranian, great quality hookah and long lasting. Karaoke night was a blast for our company and we definitely had fun)!!! I have to say I will not only come back but feels like Im a resident here) two thumbs up and much success for these ambitious owners)!!!
3981	1	a	Green Dacha is my favorite hookah place in town . Me and my friends always show up early just to be able to get a seat because it gets packed. The service is always awesome . Their food delicious . I 've had nearly everything from the menu . \nIf you are new to the area or just visiting I would highly recommend going there . The crowd is friendly , the staff is great and the hookahs are always amazing !
3982	1	a	Great atmosphere, superb service, and GOOOOOD FOOOD! I usually expect the healthy choice in any restaurant to be a compromise.  Not at Green Dacha! I ordered the chicken breast plate, and honestly this was the best I've ever had it prepared - even the rice was seasoned and tasty as is and needed absolutely no condiments or sauce! Will definitely come back to try the breakfast.
3983	0	a	I come from NY and grew up on Russian food. After moving to Vegas four years ago, I was very disappointed with Vegas' lack of East Euro food. \n\nWhen I heard about Dacha I was excited and went there to eat. The service was good, very clean inside and even the music was enjoyable.\n\nThe reason for the two star rating is because of what happened with the food. The food itself, Russian stew and Russian salad, was very enjoyable. I pretty much ate it all. However, about two hours later I started getting sick and by nighttime I was vomiting for hours. \n\nI'm used to eating this food from the family and I have a strong stomach (have not vomited in 12 years until now). Not sure what rubbed me the wrong way, possibly a spice was used that I'm not familiar with. Not sure what it was, but certainly not running to eat there again.
3984	1	a	This place is awesome\nI never thought that Russian and Israeli food can mix, but I was wrong.\nEverything taste very good, the ambiance was cool and we felt like home
3985	0	a	I give it 1 because no high chair \nWe order the food well done but was bloody!! \nI just like the palinma
3986	1	a	Their special hookah was awesome. The food was decent.The ambience was very good and you feel like home\nFinally you can definitely visit the place for HOOKAH!!!
3987	1	a	I was looking for a nice hookah lounge to sesh at on my trip to Las Vegas for New Years. Green Dacha grill and hookah lounge surpassed my expectation.\n\nThe Food\nI ordered the chicken Kiev with a side of ranch and it was very tasty, they have one of the best ranch recipes I've ever tried. \n\nThe Hookah\nI ordered their house blend OMG which was a mixture of many different berries. The clouds were thick and the flavor was rich.\n\nThe Atmosphere\nThe interior design of Green Dacha  is aesthetically pleasing, a lot of work was put into this place. Couches were very comfy. \n\nOverall, great experience.
3988	1	a	Delicious Pelmeni, Verinike, Borsht, Bread, Beef Kabobs, Potatoes, Salad, and the Neapolitan was a delicious dessert cake w hot tea.
3989	0	a	Apparently they are doing a pre grand opening event by invitation only... My response is WTF WHAT KIND OF FAST FOOD JOINT DOES THAT???!!! we were turned away at the door. They just lost customers, we won't be back.
3990	1	a	"I only ordered the chicken. It was excellent, juicy without a hint of oiliness or greasiness, crispy outside, tender inside without being \""mushy.\""  Sauces and fries lend themselves more to personal tastes, so even though I sneaked some off my wife's plate, I won't comment on them but I believe pretty much anyone who had the chicken I had would give it the highest marks. You order at the counter and they bring it to your table. Price was $1.09 per piece and in my opinion worth it."
3991	0	a	Disappointing. I really wanted to like this place because our teenagers love it.  It was lunch time and it was handy.  It was sooo busy and I just knew it would be great.  It was barely so-so.  Yes, really. Not so much.  KFC has much better flavor.  Hard to believe. The sauce is not that great and like others have mentioned the fries were worse than frozen from my oven.  Don't waste your money or time.
3992	0	a	This place is a new kind of pathetic low for the fast food industry. My family and I went last night (11/24/14) to pick up a quick dinner for my brother only. We were all blown away by the incompetence of the staff AND management. We walked in, and promptly ordered a simple chicken sandwich for my brother. That's all. We then took a seat in their waiting area by the register and proceeded to watch the cashier gal (didn't catch her name, she wasn't wearing a nametag either) goof off with her co-workers and kitchen staff for a solid 15 minutes (it was not busy at all; we were the only ones in line at the time). \n\nIn those minutes, we watched our simple order be sent back to the kitchen THREE times for whatever reason (I don't even want to know). We then watched an employee place his order after us and receive his order before us. And finally, while being annoyed by the LOUD cashier girl goof around with her co-workers, we watched a presumable MANAGER actually see them goofing around and disregard it completely.\n\nBy this point, we were about ready to ask for a refund and leave, but we finally got our order after waiting 15 minutes. After that, the rest of my family decided to eat at the Wendy's across the street, where our large order was completed in under 5 minutes. WENDY'S has a much more competent staff than this place.\n\nThe food was good according to my brother, but not worth waiting for while employees played butt-grab with each other for 15 minutes.\n\nWill not be coming back. Would not recommend this place to anyone.
3993	0	a	Against my better judgement I came back here.  The employees here are what truly make this place a sinkhole of awful with their attitudes.  The food is below average, but if the staff weren't spending all of their time hanging out as if this was their own personal teenage hangout, maybe it would be better... maybe.  Dozens of better places IN THE AREA, and I mean fast food wise.  This was my second and without question the last time I ever come to this place.
3994	0	a	Ordered delivery. Took an extra long time despite not living far from it. When the delivery driver got to my door, she regretted to inform me that whatever sauce there was in my bag, she accidentally spilled inside. To make matters more annoying, she didn't bring proper change to break my $20 bill so I ended up tipping much more than I wanted.  And to add insult to injury, the food just did not taste good.
3995	0	a	Pizza is definitely not NY style. Soft crust not crisp like NY pizza. Mediocre pizza at best.  Crust tastes like frozen pizza crust. I wont be going back.
3996	0	a	"PIzza was good.  Delivery was slow.  Delivery driver didn't know how long it took, expressed surprise when I told him it was over an hour, and then he dropped a container of ranch dressing on my front porch. It exploded. He looked at it, said \""oops\"", shrugged his shoulders, and left.  I will not be ordering from here again."
3997	1	a	Just ordered from GrubHub, delivery was a little late but that was cool since it was pretty far away. Ordered a Philly Cheesesteak, flavor was great. Just wish for Christmas I would have got more cheese whiz on the top of the sandwich. :(
3998	0	a	Seriously misled by the yelp reviews and rating. Did everyone eat the same pizza I had? Because it was awful. I would rather eat Little Caesar's terrible pizza puck for a quarter of the price with double the flavor, and a bagged salad from Safeway. \n\nOrdered the Bronx Bomber with a bunch of meats, all really low quality. Giant rectangles of squeaky ham squares marbled with big visible veins of fat should have been a cut to a quarter of that size (and wouldn't hurt to order up from your meat dealer, because when you buy low the taste reflects that). Meatballs tasted old with an odd mealy texture and metallic tang that dominated the flavors and left a terrible lingering aftertaste. Sausage rounds were forgettable. Pepperoni was okay but flabby and not crispy, like everything on the pizza. And it's not because the toppings were packed to tight, that's for sure. Weird crust too, bland and floury with zero flavor and no rise. Despite the flabby toppings and cheap cheese, the crust was somehow burned too? All for the low, low price of $17!\n\nGot an antipasto salad too with the house dressing, couple handfuls of romaine lettuce for $6 with salami, more awful ham I discarded, pepperoni, provolone, and onions. Again everything was chopped way too big. Don't get the house dressing either. All oil and dried spices. \n\nI was super excited to have a new pizza joint five minutes from my house, but that excitement was misplaced. Tossed the leftovers.
3999	0	a	pretty terrible. ordered delivery through grub hub for a chicken kabab meal with two sides and penne bolognese with garlic bread. the pasta was not bad but they forgot the ranch side salad with it and had to come back to deliver it. the garlic bread was dry and had burned corners. \n\nthe chicken kabab meal was pretty gross. the chicken itself was okay once microwaved but the pita bread was soggy due to being placed right next to the chicken. the tabouli and Greek salad were like something out of a bad comedy movie. the tabouli was not tabouli, see picture. I'm still trying to figure out what the orange pieces on it were. I tried some and it just tasted like slightly pickled cucumbers and tomatoes. the Greek salad had no dressing but did have melted cheese on top. \n\nif you can, (I'm aware of the limited amount of decent delivery food places in tempe) avoid this place. or at least don't order the salads or tabouli. you've been warned.
4000	0	a	Not a good experience.\nFirst of all, we had a choice between sitting inside with live music that was ridiculously loud or sitting outside on the patio with no fans or misting system in Arizona.\nSecondly, their vegetarian menu items are limited to a cheese pizza (which appeared to of come out of a box), or a pretzel.\nNext, my Reuben sandwich had approximately half a teaspoon of Russian dressing and absolutely no sauerkraut. When I asked the waitress about this, she checked with the kitchen who informed her that they didn't have any sauerkraut, but they sent it out without it anyway. Not a good decision.\nWhile the beer flight was good, my wife's iced tea had all indications of having come out of some sort of mix.\nThe final straw was when the lady at the table behind us lit up her cigarette. I challenged the waitress as to whether smoking was allowed and she said it was, despite being in clear violation of Arizona state law.\nThe bottom line? While I may return for the beer, my wife most likely won't be back anytime soon.
4001	0	a	Looking forword to a brewery on the west side, what a disappointment. There was no beer or drink menu. We asked our server what kind of beer they had...She could not tell us. The food menu had very little options. Our server took our drink and food order. My husband's flight came out, but I waited 15 minutes for my drink. Waited again for our food She lost our order. Our server .came back again and asked us if we wanted dessert...We told her we never received our dinner!! After 3 times we finally received our food...not good. Will not be back. Not enough T.Vs either. What a waste of 2 1/2 hours
4002	1	a	Okay was going to try and be cute (I said try) and make a picture that read I don't always drink beer but when I do I do it at Saddle Mountain Brewing Company. But not only am I not cute but apparently I have no usable skills either. But to all of the people on my face book page if you are looking for some great food, great beer and some good music visit Saddle Mountain Brewing Company and if you are not looking for the above mentioned go there any way and support your local Brewery.
4003	1	a	Happy to see  a new place open so close to home, great food, but they need to improve service. Too many servers standing around chatting.
4004	0	a	Food good.  Service, not so much.\nWhy does a brewery make two customers wait nearly ten minutes for a beer?  Confused servers, that's why.  When they finally figured out who had what table and brought us our beers I thought ours troubles were over.\nWrong.\nOrdered an appetizer when we ordered lunch.  20 minutes later lunch comes out with no appetizer.  The server looked at me like I was nuts when I asked her about the app.  I even had to ask her to look at her order pad to see if she took the order to make sure I wasn't insane.  She delivered brutal service and was tipped accordingly.  \nFood was good .. My friend commented on how good the burger was.\nThey've been open a week ... Still work to do, I guess.
4005	0	a	"We tried this place on 10/31.  We had to wait 15 minutes for our beer order to be taken--it was taken by the hostess since no server had come by.  We then had to wait about 15 more minutes to get the beer--and that was with 3 bartenders.  I ordered the green chile pork and my husband ordered the basic hamburger.  We had to wait over 30 minutes for the order--then 10 orders came out at once--a 6-top and 2 deuces.  The 6-top and one deuce put their orders in after ours.\n\nI asked the server if the pork was shredded--she wasn't sure.  It is served in chunks--however, she didn't know the word \""chunks\"".  The tortilla that comes with it is 14\"" big--the server said that's the way they do it in California.  It is unmanageable and it was \""wet\""-- probably due to being wrapped in foil.\n\nMy husband's fries were room temperature and his hamburger was lukewarm.  He asked for steak sauce and was informed by our server that this was not a steak house. The server brought out another order of fries--they were hot and delicious. I questioned why the fries were \""steam-tabled\"" and she said it was because people want fast service.  A 30 minute wait is fast service??\n\nThe beer was good, the food not so good.\n\nThe servers spend a lot of time walking without doing anything.  Since the wait was so long from the kitchen, I assume there is a problem in there as well.\n\nI sent this review to the owner the same day--no response.  If the owner doesn't care enough to respond--which is the polite thing to do even if he didn't like the comments--then I doubt we will be returning."
4006	0	a	"This was our first visit, we normally go to Augies but figured we'd try this place. I was excited when I saw a packed parking lot, and even more excited when I saw there was plenty of seating.  We were given menu's, sat ourselves on the end of a community table and reviewed the menu. After a few minutes we knew what we wanted to drink and eat. After about 10 minutes no waiter had stopped by, we asked someone else at the table if they had been helped, they said \""no\"".  We waited a few more minutes and left. When leaving the hostess asked why we were leaving, their excuse was they're new. I'll continue to go to Augies and never give this place another thought. \n\nThis is my first ever review."
4007	0	a	The food lacks creativity and inspiration. \n\nThe wings were pricey $10/10 they were drumettes so they were kinda meaty. The wing sauce has an identity crisis, it's half Franks and half Sweet Baby Rays BBQ sauce, a lousy combination. My $10 burger did not come with fine shredded lettuce as the menu indicates it came with a flimsy piece of green leaf lettuce. The red onions were very scant, nor was I asked how I wanted the burger cooked. You can probably get a better burger at Dead Robin....The fries were dry and did taste like fish some. Her $13 Rueben had a shred or 2 of sauerkraut and the corned beef seemed to be rubbery like it was boiled all day and had no flavor at all. \n\nService was good and the place is nice. It's very unlikely we will return.
4008	1	a	Really good food.   Enjoyed the French dip sandwich,  excellent! My husband had the pastrami sandwich  and was so tender and had nice smokey flavor.    We will definitely be back.
4009	1	a	The service was great and the burgers delicious. Well def be back, glad to have a brewery in Goodyear.
4010	0	a	Went here with my parents. Very small and cramped.  Your sitting shoulder to shoulder with people you don't even know. Service was slow. Everyone was nice.. but slow. The waitresses chatted a lot with their own friends instead of taking care of their customers. My mom's food was delicious but my dad was very unhappy. He specifically asked for certain things not to be on his burger and they did it anyway. I think this was partially on the waitresses since they don't write anything down you say. Also, asked for our check and it took them ten minutes to get it to us and no the waitress gave it to us with no pen. Took her a while to come back with a pen since she was socializing.  Just overall not happy with the experience.
4011	1	a	Really like what's happening here.  Improved service .. Food is well above average .. Honestly, the beer is just okay.  Not much character to it ... But Saddle Mountain is a good place to be.
4012	1	a	Thankfully another craft brewery in the much too dry West Valley.  The beers were pretty good, not stellar but not a waste of time (or cash either) but what I really enjoyed was their smoked pastrami sandwich - very tasty for sure and unique.  Wife really enjoyed her lunch as well.
4013	0	a	My fianc\u00e9e and I went here with our daughter. I got fish and chips ($12), as well as the Amber Ale ($4.xx); The lady got a Ruben ($13), and the little one got chicken strips ($5). The beer was pretty good. I will probably go back and get a growler of the ale, it's nothing too special; however, it's smooth and refreshing; making for a good session type beer. I'm certainly interested enough to try all the other beers they have to offer.\n\nThe food was certainly lacking. Perhaps I'm spoiled by breweries places like Four Peaks -- where there is a bit more love in the food -- but it just seems like there was a lack of care or passion in the food.\n\nThe fish that came with the fish and chips was reminiscent of Long John Silver's; certainly a step above, but still not so great. The fries were pretty good and the tartar sauce -- relatively surprisingly -- seemed to be house made and was decent. The coleslaw was god awful. It was bland and essentially tasted like they had done barely anything to the cabbage/carrot mix. \n\nI didn't try my fianc\u00e9e's ruben so I can't speak too much to it; however, it was unusually fatty -- even for pastrami. The meat was cooked inconsistently; parts of it looked like roast beef. All in all, it was not a $13 sandwich.\n\nThe kids chicken strips was your standard bar-type chicken strips. I don't think this would bother most people, but I was expecting a little more from a micro-brewery. I wouldn't think it is too difficult to make up a nice batter with some of that lovely beer, and deep fry some fresh chicken! I suppose it shouldn't be too big a deal as the kids meal was only $5, but I would pay more for better. \n\nI'd go back for the beer, and maybe munch on some fries if I get a little drunk, but I probably won't dine here again.
4014	1	a	Best burger I have had all year!! Tasty, juicy, awesome!!! The atmosphere was friendly and lively. The beer was ok but the the burger was too good for me to notice.
4015	1	a	"We have eaten at the Saddle Mountain Brewing Company several times now, including a four-course \""beer pairing\"" dinner last night. The menu is not extensive but it is nicely varied, offering something for everybody. The beer is the real star =, however; this is a microbrewery and all beer is brewed on the premises. The styles range from mild Pilsners to robust Pale Ales, from light to dark, and from slightly fruity to very hoppy. The menu does suggest beer pairings for the entrees, although you can certainly drink whatever style you want. The wait staff is friendly and helpful, and the atmosphere is congenial. All-in-all it's a great addition to the Goodyear, AZ dining scene!"
4016	1	a	I absolutely adore Dr. Claudia Garcia!!! She has been our children's pediatrician for over 4 years now. We started seeing her when she was with Foothills Pediatrics and now she has ventured out on her own and we have followed. She always explains everything in detail and has amazing patience. She explains things to the children as well. I however, am not happy with the front desk. I called to get some answers about my children's prescriptions and the phone just rang and rang. I called to leave a message and got no return phone call. Finally they called me regarding a urologist referral for my son and then I got to ask my questions. I was so frustrated!!! However, that will not keep us from taking our children to such an amazing pediatrician. We love and trust Dr. Garcia to the fullest!!! Before her, my children had never been to a regular pediatrician. They only saw a Dr. when they became ill. So finding a pediatrician was very new and terrifying, we were lucky to find such a great doctor on the first attempt. Thank you Dr. Garcia for everything!!!
4017	0	a	"If I could leave no stars I would. Beware- do not take your child to Dr. Claudia Garcia when you actually need your pediatrician to examine your sick child. \n\nI called My Kids Doctor on a Monday  afternoon at 12:30 asking to make a sick appointment. I was told I didn't need appointment to just walk-in before 3 pm. I took my child who was running a 100.8 fever and complaining of severe stomach cramps to the office as a \""walk-in\"". I arrived at 2pm and was called back to an exam room at 2:45. We then sat in the exam room until 3:30 when I finally asked the nurse how much longer it would be before we would see the doctor. Meanwhile my daughter is dryheaving and crying. The Nurse tells me she would check with the doctor, she comes back and tells me it will be another 45 mins to an hour. I explained that we had been there since 2pm and she stated she was sorry but the doctor had to see her appointments first then her sick walk-ins. I asked if sick children take presidence over healthy ones and she simply said no. Wow! By now my child has vomited 3 times. I asked the Nurse a second time to get the doctor and again I was told we would have to wait our turn. I have never encountered a Pediatrician will no moral ethics or compassion. I mean their speciality is children. If you are not equipped or staffed to handle sick appointments than do not accept them. But allowing a patient to wait(a sick patient at that) that long is just unprofessional. Need less to say I left and took my child to another Pediatrician. Please don't make the same mistake I did with trusting the care of your child's health to Dr. Claudia Garcia."
4018	0	a	I called on Friday morning to fill a script for my six year old son.  I never received a call back.  I called again on Monday and spoke to a nurse.  They were too busy to send a script over to Walgreens, but if Walgreens sent the request over via fax, they would handle it.  Actually, Walgreens sent the fax three times and never got a response.  It took days upon days and hours of calls just to fill a simple script for seasonal allergies.  After waiting to see the Dr. for 2 hours today, we decided to get request records and find another pediatrician.  We were told it was $6.50 for the records and handed them a $10.00 Bill.  After being told they didn't have change, the staffer physically ripped up the records they had printed right in front of us.  The service is poor, the staff is inept and rude, they have no concern for your schedule, cannot be counted on, etc.  Our experience with this Dr. was terrible.
4019	1	a	Hands down phenomenal experience.  I was a little hesitant to hire a moving company because of the horror stories that I've heard about movers damaging furniture or holding your stuff hostage in the truck until you cough up more money.  But after looking over their website and reading more about them, I felt better.  I was in a bind and they, luckily, were able to squeeze me in the next day.  \n\nThe day arrived and to my surprise, they were really jovial and upbeat, even after showing them that we had a heavy adjustable bed on the second floor an two never ending closets filled with crap. Another surprise, true to their word on the website, they really will jog when not handling your belongings. \n\nAfter about three hours of loading, we drove to our new home and they were still as upbeat as ever.  My wife stood by the truck and directed them to where all of the boxes and furniture belonged.  They were done in a little less than two hours.  I know for a fact that it would have taken myself, my wife, and our family all day if we had to do it ourselves.  \n\nIt's been a full day and we've unpacked all of our boxes and nothing was damaged.  I'm still in shock as to how smoothly everything went. I cannot think of anything that they could have done to make the experience any better.  My only regret is that I won't be moving again for a long time, but I am definitely recommending them to anyone that is moving.  Seriously, there is absolutely nothing to worry about with these guys, they were perfect.
4020	1	a	Fantastic Karate Studio. Each of the instructors are very sincere and willing to help students of any skill level. Lots of variety within the classes, a large mix of both kids and adults. Prices are very reasonable compared to other studios. I've tried both the Jiu Jitsu classes as well as the Chun Kuk Do and both are excellent! Highly recommend for anyone looking into martial arts.
4021	1	a	Love the instructors. Very encouraging. They make everybody feel welcome. I would recommend this class to anyone interested in martial arts.
4022	1	a	These guys know what they are doing. Great work and the price is right!! Highly recommend
4023	1	a	These guys are awesome!! They came all the way to my house in Queen Creek. They fix my iPad Air and iPhone. They were both cracked terribly. But now they look like new!! It was great deal and they added tempered glass for a discount. They were super friendly and I didn't feel weird having strangers in my house. These guys are legit! They use good quality glass compared to the other company i used. I would definitely use them again!! If you need your phone or ipad glass fix, call these guys! Serious, you don't need to look anywhere else.
4024	1	a	The food is to die for. Try the fried chicken. Best in town. All the sides are amazing as well they really have such great flavor. Can't wait to come here with my fiance and friends as this is my new go to spot. Awesome patio and bar and the service is great too.
4025	1	a	"I had dinner and drinks at \""The Upton\"" in Scottsdale last night. A very cool spot that had been the \""Petite  Maison for years ( near Scottsdale road and Camelback).  The food was awesome. A very unique blend of master chef created items that are in many ways \""American with a comfort food feel\"".  The parking was great and the inviting patio was filled with a great casual  atmosphere.\n\nThe drink menu had uniquely \""in house\"" concoctions that would please anyone with an adventurous  palette. Amazing\n\nFinally... The staff was awesome. Truly \""on top of it\"" and great to talk to as well. \n\nI recommend this to anyone that wants great food, amazing house music and not to have 40 TV's dominating the agenda with raucous sports fans yelling. So much In Scottsdale has become just that. \n\nIm heading back.  Great spot"
4026	1	a	Phenomenal food, great, imaginative cocktails with a well crafted wine list, and an atmosphere that manages to be both casual and intimate.  I highly recommend the outdoor seating area in the back and the house-made ramen which was the best I've ever had.  If I lived in the area The Upton would would absolutely be my go-to restaurant. \n\nThe Upton is a delightful slice of authenticity in the fake plastic palm tree that is Scottsdale.
4027	1	a	We went here one evening just after it opened.  The inside was very crowded, I didn't even see a free table inside.  They seated us at a nice table outside.  The waiter recommended a few items on the menu, so we gave them a shot.\n\nI ordered the fried chicken. I was sold on ordering this because the server said it was infused with duck fat.  This chicken was super rich and moist.  I'd definitely suggest getting it.\n\nOthers at the table ordered the chicken, tacos, and a sandwich.  Everyone seemed to really love their food.\n\nI'd definitely suggest going!
4028	1	a	You have to check out The Upton! My sisters and I came for dinner and we loved it. Great service and excellent food. My favorite appetizers were the ribs and the burrata. Order both. You won't be disappointed. For dinner we ordered the fried picnic chicken. So good! For dessert, try the smores. This fabulous new restaurant nestled in old town Scottsdale is a must try! Don't be surprised if this spot becomes your favorite neighborhood go to!
4029	0	a	Drinks were mediocre, a couple of the menu items were good, others were quite bland. One of the owners stopped by to ask how everything was and we told him. He graciously said he would comp all of the food, but when we got the bill only two items were taken off. Not sure why he said one thing and did another. Won't go back
4030	1	a	Visiting AZ and found this place by chance. Glad we did. The food and service was excellent. We ordered way too much food but we had to since it all looked so good. The mason jar chopped salad was great and the jar was a cool touch. The pork tacos also stood out to me when they melted in my mouth. We also loved the plantains that looked like waffle fries. I highly recommend. Oh yeah and it was so good we will go back tonight with the family.
4031	0	a	"I never write reviews but I felt like my experience here called for one. My husband and I were really excited to try this place for brunch on New Year's Day, but we left feeling completely disappointed and unsatisfied, if not somewhat disgusted. I will say that the cocktails and crispy confit duck wings were delicious. However, the chicken fried chicken sandwich and pork tostada, the two reasons we selected this restaurant in the first place, were awful. The chicken fried chicken was anything but. What was served instead was mushy dark meat chicken formed together in a patty like mold, breaded and lightly fried. The texture was so off putting and impossible to eat as a \""sandwich\"". It was like fried chicken tartare slapped on an English muffin. Even worse was the pork tostada. The pork was drenched in liquid smoke. The taste was so artificial and it lingered in my mouth for close to an hour after we left. We had to go to another restaurant for a drink to wash the taste from our mouths. \n\nI understand this is a new restaurant and they are still working out the kinks. Their menu is very promising but the recipes  need some major work. And unfortunately, though their dinner menu sounds fabulous, after this terrible experience, we won't likely be back to try it. \n\nSadly, not a good way to start 2015."
4032	1	a	Had the angus beef hash for brunch, delicious! The Bloody Mary was to die for! Definitely coming back.
4033	1	a	My wife and I had an early happy hour at the Upton after a movie. We shared almost all of the offered happy hour items, including the pork tacos, the shishito peppers, the steamed pork buns, and the burrata. All were done perfectly and priced very well for the size of each serving. \n\nWe found Chris Waddell and the staff to be friendly and helpful as well.\n\nWe will definitely be back!\n\nMarc and Kristin Bailes
4034	1	a	The folks at Chef Zen are THE NICEST people! I got this recommendation from May at SK donuts in L.A.  So glad I drove out from Henderson just to try the cheese croissant rolls here as they are the best I've had in Vegas, comparable to the ones I've stood in long lines for at Portos in Glendale.  My teenage daughter ordered the honeydew boba and I gotta say it was OUT. OF. THIS. WORLD. AMAZING!  I'm not a big fan of honeydew, but this one had such a bright, crisp, refreshing taste to it without tasting artificial whatsoever.  Honestly, the best smoothie I've ever had.  I also tried the cruller, twisty donut, and picked up a jar of ube (filipino treat) and everything was super fresh and wonderful!  Paolo and his mom took great care of us, taking the time to tell us about each of the wonderful treats they had.  Will definitely be coming back to this bakery again and again.  So worth it!
4035	1	a	PSST-HOY!\nColor me surprised-I didn't know this place was here.  Waiting on a friend for breakfast at the pancake place next door, I checked out this new Filipino eatery that has taken the place of Dee's Donuts.  Albert and his brother, Chef Paolo, are manning this spot that offers donuts, empanadas, malasadas, pan de sal, pancit, boba, turon, leche flan and more.  All the Filipinos can rejoice!  They also sell the popular Filipino sweets pastillas, red bean haupia, and polvoron, which comes in the regular version as well as red velvet--wow, that's a first for me!  Polvoron is a powdered milk candy that comes individually wrapped in white paper.  I got to try the macadamia version and it was delicious, melting in da mouth:  salamat! Paolo also gave me a mini pina colada muffin (cupcake without frosting) that he was testing, fresh out of the oven:  masarap!  Not the right time if I wanted pan de sal: sayang.  Albert says those fly out the door because they only make 6 dozen per day and were all gone already.  However you can pre-order for the next day for most items.  Empanadas were ready at 8:00am, but the malasadas and the popular cream cheese croissants don't come out of the oven until around 10:00am.  I'll definitely have to come back to try those out, as well as their turon (deep-fried banana rolls), pancit, empanadas, pastillas, etc.  Pinoy power!
4036	0	a	Meh.  It's not really great. Expensive drinks. I made a mistake of not asking about how much things are since they're not posted. Two thai ice teas, one bottle orange juice and one donut came out to be $18. And another disappointing thing was they ran out of cup lids the day I went. \n\n\n\nWould not recommend going, nothing special to warrant the price.
4037	0	a	"Got a little UYE together for all of us to go try this new Lo-Lo's location for the first time, just up the street from their previous location.  We had Robyn N., Norm R., Linda, Mike C., Jackie R. and myself for this visit, and we all enjoyed each other's company.     :-)\n\nI ordered the \""Famous Soulfood Platter\"" with a chicken breast, leg and wing.  It comes with a big corn muffin and choice of 2 sides.  I went with Cheese Grits and Homefried Potatoes.\n\nTHE BEST:\n\n*  Were able to park by Lo-Lo's building... no having to deal with manditory Valet parking that they fire up when things get busy.\n\n*  The dining room here is nice, and comfortable.\n\n*  My chicken leg and wing were delicious, as were the cheese grits.\n\n*  Food side portions were generous.\n\n= = = = = =\n\nTHE REST:\n\n*  The table service was slow and disorganized, with various servers who had no idea who was supposed to get what showing up at the table with our food over a long period of time...  and this was with the place not very busy.     :-O\n\n*  My chicken breast was very dried out, and so was the corn muffin.\n\n*  The home fries were very dry too, and I didn't care for them. \n\n*  It was a VERY EXPENSIVE chicken lunch at $18.50 with a drink (forty-some dollars for two of us with the expected tip, which they spelled out on the check!).  On top of that the server tried to overcharge me several dollars more!     :-O\n\n= = = = = =\n\nAs good as two of the pieces of the chicken were, this will be a last visit for me to this Lo-Lo's location.     :-("
4038	1	a	Have you been to the new spot? No you haven't? You have to check them out now!  \n\nNot only do they have a new place, but a new menu too, with sooo much to offer, this time around I went for the fried green tomatoes, those were delish just what I had been wanting, crave them sometimes and now it's nice to know Lo Los can fix that craving too! Also ordered the Lo Los punch, which is red Kool-Aid with a kick, oh that baby was sweet!\n\nEven with all the new items on the menu, I had to order the #8, a perfectly fried chicken breast and waffle, I don't even like fried chicken but I crave Lo Lo's!\n\nLove the new spot, love the new menu and love the good food!
4039	1	a	if you haven't been here you need to go!!! off a friend of a friend this place was and is off the chain.Drinks come in  huge mason jars they even have kool-aid and a DJ yup I'm coming back for sure!!
4040	1	a	Virtual clap to the new innovative location. I've been a frequent diner since Lolo's first started and boy is this a huge in step representing success. The new location is very trendy with a sports bar type of venue. As soon as you walk through the door your'e immediately greeted by a friendly hostess. I chose the bar area which is built for seating inside and out. Since the weather was nice I dined outside. The full service bar offers not only Lolo's famous fixins but some tasty adult beverages to help wash them down. Now if your a sports fan there are big screen TV's to keep you entertained that can be seen inside and outside the venue. What is nice is the full size patio is perfect for large parties. There is even a fire pit with seating around it for those cold AZ nights. \n\nThe menu has more to offer. You can still get all the same great favorites along with some new options. Yummy appetizers, mouth watering burgers, crisp salads and much more. The only issue I have with the restaurant is what should I choose. With so many delicious things to choose from I want to be greedy and order it all.\n\nI highly recommend this restaurant for not only dining for a great meal but perfect place to take out of town guest. The location is perfect as it is right in the heart of old town scottsdale.
4041	0	a	Very disappointed
4042	1	a	Do you like fried chicken? Yes? Do you like waffles? Yes? Go to Lo Lo's or reconsider your life lol
4043	1	a	Wow wow wow! Yes that is three in a row. Having never been a fan of the whole chicken and waffle thing, we decided to try this place anyway. I always thought it was a strange combo but hubby seems to love it and who doesn't like fried chicken?\nI had the fried smothered chicken and worth every bite and I can atleast boast that while I wanted to eat the whole thing I showed great restraint and took half home. The homemade gravy was to die for and the moist chicken outstanding. I hate cornbread but honestly the best I have ever had is here. The Mac and cheese while excellent can never compare to my husbands, but with that being said it was worth every bite.\nHubby of course had chicken and waffles with a side of dirty rice. He was equally impressed! Both of us now list this place as a must return to.\nWhy only 4 stars? Perhaps because they close earlier then we would have wanted and there isn't one closer!\nCertainly worth the trip and drooling just thinking about going again!
4044	0	a	I had tried Lo Lo's before at their last location in Scottsdale and thought how great it was.  I decided to bring my friends to the new location.  Needless to say, I won't be back.  I was so disappointed in our experience and I wasn't the only one.  It was very busy the day we went- Oct 31st, 2014 - However, it looked as if the restaurant had not planned for that.  There were not enough staff on and the staff they had looked confused.  We sat at the bar and did not get noticed for about 20 minutes.  We had to ask for menus.  There were people around us complaining about how long it took to get their food.  The staff seemed as if they did not care.  There was only one bartender and she seemed to be in her own world.  We waited almost 45 minutes for our food.  I asked for a refill on coffee and that took another 25 minutes and I had to ask twice.  The kicker was they did not give me a new cup and she poured old coffee and when she realized it was bad she said she would get me new - however put the same old cup back.  When the new coffee came another person took my old cup and poured coffee into it... \nEven the guy next to us was complaining how slow the service was.  They never apologized and as we were leaving I saw a woman complaining to the manager about her poor service and he was YELLING at her back.  This was very unprofessional.\nNeedless to say my friends were not impressed and I won't be back...
4045	0	a	"We placed a to-go order in advance.  We called at 11 am and arranged to pick up at 1:00.  When we arrived at 1, we had to wait an entire HOUR for our order to be ready.  They hadn't even started it!  They blamed it on their \""lunch rush\"" but the service was absolutely appalling.  Another couple had been waiting a long time for their order as well and were really frustrated when we walked in.  We finally had to flag down a manager who had only been working there 3 days and she didn't know what to do.  She ended up giving us a discount but it really didn't make up for the fact that our order was an entire hour later than promised.  All of the employees looked flustered and scattered.  They need to work out their systems.  I know this is a new location but I would imagine they would have moved the staff when they moved the restaurant as it's only 2 blocks away from its previous location.  There was no direction at all.\n\nThe food overall was decent but I would not go back due to the appalling lack of service."
4046	0	a	We were at Jamba Juice and decided to stop and get something to eat, had really been wanting to try this place since they opened. When we walked in the hostess said we couldn't bring outside drinks in. I had just bought a smoothie so we walked out. I won't be back to try this place, that is an extremely stupid reason to turn away business.
4047	0	a	Worst experience ever! We went in excited to try the q new location. Our service was ok( she seemed new  and not experienced)  the food was terrible. The childrens mac and cheese comes with bacon. Was never told. My husband order a dish with rice was not cooked. My pasta was overcooked and gross. When we complained the manager scolded the waitress in front of us. Then told us he would take care of our bill and we would pay for my daughters and a beer. When received the bill it was 32.00 for a kids meal and beer. We had the most expensive childrens meal on the face of the planet. I will be calling corporate tomorrow. I tipped the server out of pitty. Will never be back!
4048	0	a	"They now have a new policy: they won't let you order takeout over the phone without giving them your credit card number. That's right: You have to tell them your credit card number, have them write it down in a busy kitchen with all sorts of pieces of paper flying around before they tack it up where anybody walking in off the street can read it plainly, and then PRAY that nothing happens to it.\n\nThis is ridiculous, especially if you were planning on paying in cash. It was explained as a \""Well, what happens if you order something then don't come in for it?\"" situation. BS. If someone orders then doesn't pay, you simply don't accept orders from that phone number anymore, rather than treating EVERYONE like a potential criminal.\n\nPS: Lest anyone thinks this is a \""New Customer Only\"" thing, I'd ordered takeout twice from this same location using the same phone number, came in and paid for it, then went home without incident. But now I'm not to be trusted??? In that case, I can trust them to get along without my business."
4049	1	a	Fantastic all around!!  The service is great and the chicken and waffles I had were delightful. The pieces were plump with an ok amount of crunch. The waffle was large but thin which is the way I like it. It's a very popular place with the tables filling up quickly on a Saturday morning. Very impressed and will definitely return for breakfast next time I'm in the Phoenix area.
4050	1	a	I ate at Lolo's for the first time tonight, and it was great. My friend and I got there at 6pm, prime time on a Saturday night. They got us a table fairly quickly, even after telling us there would be a 25 minute wait. Our waiter was prompt, attentive, and got us our food quickly. I had one fried chicken breast, one waffle, and a side of mac n cheese. All of the food was delicious. The fried chicken is crispy, not greasy, and still moist inside-- basically the perfect fried chicken. My friend and I were both really impressed by the new restaurant. The atmosphere is very lively, and it's a beautiful space. My only complaint is the parking is a little inadequate for how popular and busy the restaurant is. I will definitely be back.
4051	1	a	This place is awesome true southern food! The waffles are the best I have ever tasted sweet and crispy on the outside and soft in the middle. The fried chicken is perfect, it's all good! Highly recommend this place.
4052	0	a	Since the first one I wrote disappeared, I thought I would try again.  \n\nFirst, I have to say that the food at Lo-Lo's is excellent.  I've enjoyed the few times I've made it to the old location.  Now on to the new one.  First, the new chairs are very uncomfortable to sit in.  When we were seated, they tried to put us in the bar area first.  We were there early afternoon, and the rest of the place was not crowded.  The music in the entire place is way too loud for a restaurant, and worse in the bar area.  So I asked to be moved.  I don't like having to shout at the people I've having a meal with.  Our wait for the food was not too long.  But getting someone's attention for anything was a bit hard.  Turn the music down and tell your people they are not there to talk to each other.  Also, when I mentioned the loud music I got an attitude from the server.  I think if I need Lo-Lo's chicken again, I'll get it to go.
4053	1	a	YUM! This place is good. Fried pickles, Rotisserie Chicken, cole slaw!\nI did not try the fried chicken and waffles but saw many having it and smiling so it must have been good. Recommend!
4054	1	a	This place has a nice layout. Outside seating is nice to enjoy the weather in the afternoon, and watch the cars pass by while eating and conversating. \n\nService was bery pleasant. Servers were nice, happy, sweet, and helpful towards our orders. \n\nFood was good! I tried something new, and it made me nervous. When i took the first bite, it was savory and flavorful. \n\nIt can  get loud, but it was peaceful this time. \n\nSo i would say this is perfect for food dates, and hangingout in general enjoying food. \n\nWould i go here again? Yes! This is my 7th time. I recommend this to anyone. I gave 4 stars only cuz i didnt feel it was a five star kick!
4055	0	a	I was really disappointed after reading the great reviews.\n\nVery average.  Denny's would have been as good.\n\n The fried okra was bland with no seasoning.  The waffle was OK, the chicken breasts were bland and dry.  The sweet tea was fruity not sweet. The chili tasted as though it came out of a can and then had hot sauce liberally applied.  The food was hot though.\nThe service was quick and so was the check.  The check had items on it that we did not order.  I thought the prices were really high.  $37 for two at lunch without cocktails.\n\nAfter the reviews, I had to try it but will not be back.
4056	0	a	This is a chicken and waffles place with valet parking.  The utter pretentiousness would normally have turned me around, but chicken and waffles was on my bucket list,so I persevered.  \n\nI sat at the bar, and the bartender was friendly enough.  They have nice fruit juices.  I ordered the plate with everything, chicken, waffles, eggs, and grits.  The grits and eggs were well-prepared, the waffles are served with hot syrup, but the chicken isn't very good.  It tasted old, like it had been sitting around for awhile.  Check the bucket list, no reason to go back here.\n\nBTW, if you still want to go, and you, too, are put off the pomposity of valet at the soul food place, you can park your own car twenty feet from the door, but I'd skip Lo-Lo's
4057	0	a	For breakfast stick to chicken and waffles
4058	1	a	"After several years, I finally got to go to the Lo-Lo's Chicken & Waffles in south Scottsdale (at their new location a bit north of their old location).\n\nI think all of the rave reviews I'd heard from so many people ramped up my expectations. In truth, Lo-Lo's is a good family restaurant that has built up a loyal fan base that freely recommends its fare. That's not a bad thing at all.\n\nI had a good, down-home meal and finally got to find out what grits are--nice. My eggs-over-easy with cheese and onions were tasty. The fried chicken crust was crunchy and tasted great, but the pieces were a bit on the small side. The waffles could have been more crisp.\n\nThe minor issues cited above might have dropped my rating to 4.51, but that still would round to a \""5.\"" What dropped them below 4.50 was the slowness of bringing and refilling our water and the long wait for the food. I think we visited at the tail-end of their busy, post-church Sunday afternoon, but they should have been ready for that.\n\nOverall, it's a good time and I'll visit again at some point."
4059	1	a	In town for business co worker recommend this place. I ended up going back for dinner the next day and taking some home... Just really good food
4060	0	a	Over priced for Medicor food,   service is really slow,   took 45 mins to get food on a Monday at 11, {and after asking 3 times}  the only thing was good were the names of the food.   Made me lauph for a bit,  but sadly,  that's it.  There's nothing really unique or special about  this place,   service was sub par,  waitreses were air headed,  food was OK,  but not worth the price.  Rather go to Dennys or waffle house and pay alot less for same taste.  Aaaand be able to get it in a timely manner.
4061	0	a	I went at 2PM and it took close to an hour. The were 7 people at the reception who for 15 minutes or more were leaning on a chair at my table or had their butts up against the table. Finally one with V pocket dungarese noticed me and pulled the one leaning on the chair away from my table. No acknowledgement. Monica the manager? was explaining an installation a gentleman was doing.\nThe place was noisy with a sub-par sound system. My table was not clean. The food was boring. I had ordered desert to be brought to me when I finished the Ivan's chorizo, eggs, potatoes. After having waited at least 15 minutes after finishing my waitress came by with a pile of dirty dishes and pulled out my check.\nI said the service was terrible, the seven people in front of me part of who leaned on my  table and to take back the bill and remove the desert she had forgotten. There was a couple siting to my left who also had finished eating and sitting unattended for an extended period  There was all sorts of banter in front of me but no time for a customer. The picture taken was after I they moved away from my table.
4062	0	a	What a joke ! I have never had such flavorless dry chicken and waffles before. I don't even know how its possible to not season chicken and how waffles could turn out tasting as delicious as paper napkins. Could only eat half of our order and threw most of it out. This place has a long ways to go, yikes.
4063	0	a	food is soooo good\n\nService is soooo terrible\n\nBut since the food is so delicious we will be back
4064	0	a	Disappointed. Food was mediocre and service was slow. This is a southern place and the chicken gravy was brown!!! Meh.
4065	0	a	Food is great. Service is absolutely terrible from the valet, to the kitchen and management. \n\nThey had 1 guy parking and retrieving cars and another just standing there doing nothing. I had to wait to enter the restaurant until the one valet guy addressed the needs of 5 people that were leaving. Really, I Have to wait to actually spend my $$$. \n\nWe ordered an appetizer that never came and had 1 libation in 40 minutes of time at the table (the water we asked for was never brought either). \n\nThe manager came over and asked if we wanted the appetizer. Dumb solution as a manager. Of course I don't want it now, my food is at the table after a 40 minute wait and I am eating my chicken and waffle now!!!!\n\nPoor leadership yields poor service. This place needs help or the Business will fail. \n\nOne of the worst experiences a paying customer can have. \n\nToo many other options in town to waste my time with this place.
4066	0	a	"Locally owned and operated, Nice clean, bright new standalone location in Scottsdale.  Staff was friendly, welcoming, and appropriately apologetic for the insanely slow arrival of food from the kitchen, which was clearly overwhelmed on this surprisingly packed Monday night when the college kids are still gone for the holiday; Tempe appearing to be virtually dead and Scottsdale very quiet - but LoLo's big bright new location: packed.  Figuring the place must truly newly opened as in perhaps the first week or two at a brand spanking new location, and seeing my friendly host and server and the rest of the staff scrambling throughout, I made allowances and made not a complaint about the 75 minute wait for my (massive) soul food platter, but on learning this location had been open for going on 4 months, only the friendliness and apologies of the staff  - and seeing others all around me suffering similarly kept me from leaving payment for the first quart jar of sweet tea, giving up and walking out.  \n\nHalf-sweet tea was just right (so you can imagine fully loaded!), and lord knows when it finally did arrive, the serving was generous: 3 LARGE pieces meaty chicken neither greasy nor dry: good!.  The collard greens nicely done and perfected with a self-administered shot of hot pepper vinegar: very good. The house mac-n-cheese rich and cheesy but barely warm on arrival; The massive sweet cornbread muffin topped with generous mound of whipped butter probably the highlight of the meal, I knew I'd be packed but was jonesing for a slice of the house special red velvet cake that I'd had long ago at the tiny old downtown location - and so saved the massive chicken breast and half the mac for tomorrow, but this was not the red velvet of old: red yes, velvet not so much. Not \""bad\"" per se, but a tad on the dry side, and in the midst of the half I was eating, planning to save rest for tomorrow, there was a mildly off-putting slightly \""bitter\"" flavor to a couple of bites sufficient sufficient for me not want the rest  and ask to have it taken off my bill.  \n\nI've enjoyed the old downtown Phoenix location in the past and I look forward to being able to speak similarly of this location in the future. From the packed house tonight, this location is already a success, but these fine hard working folks will need to iron out some wrinkles to maintain it. \n\n(Note: edited 1/10/15 to correct wait time from 90 to \""only\"" 75 minutes to get food)."
4067	1	a	Everything that's been said about the chicken and waffles is pretty much on point.  I go here for breakfast and in addition to the chicken and waffles, I have had the breakfast fries (chili cheese fries topped with an egg and green onions) which were awesome.  I have had the sweet tea, and though it wasn't as sweet as I had expected it was still good.
4068	1	a	I had a fun time !My server was awesome! and the meals comes in a excellent variety and Im own my way back for another excellent serving of spirit meals and excellent hospitality.
4069	0	a	Giving them a 1 star is generous.  Despite reading the horrible service reviews before going we decided to try it anyway.  Shame on us!\nWe waited for a few min without being greeted behind someone applying for a job. Employees are unfriendly and rude.  We were asked to throw away our drink before allowing to be sat.  I asked for a cup to pour our drink in as we just bought it.  We were Denied that. Unfortunately service isn't their forte. I'm unsure why they are in the hospitality business.
4070	0	a	I would love to write a review on the food but after our hour + wait to get in, when we were told 40 minutes.  We have now been sitting in our booth for an hour.  My coffee I initially did not get after ordering,  and my second refill took 30 minutes after asking twice.  We have to much time invested into leaving now but... Damn this really is not the way to have people bring in the New Year... Oh and the hostess was extremely sarcastic and rude when we asked how much longer after an hour had passed.  Great now an espn camera crew is in the kitchen .. Wonder if they are eating my food... Forget breakfast, I should have ordered dinner..... Still waiting and I even finished writing this review.... 1 hope 15 min in and still waiting on food...
4071	1	a	Best soul food restaurant I've visited in years!  Definitely get the soul food platter. The catfish & greens are on point. Nothing like eating great food with old school selections in the background.  Best place to visit in AZ.
4072	1	a	Well if you never tries this you have to come and experience the novelty of chicken and waffles ..the food is always good but the service can get congested at times ..the downfall to the new Scottsdale location is parking is horrendous. .Gilbert location coming soon this yeah
4073	0	a	I been going to Lo Lo's Chicken & Waffles since way back when the place was a whole in the wall & the owners where actually part of the business. Now the owners are so concentrated in making so much money they have failed to realize their business is going down the hole! I'm very disappointed in the services for the past few visits, today I am passed disappointed I'm infuriated in the poor quality of the food! Uncooked chicken! (Disgusting) I asked for pecans in my waffles, I literally got 10 crushed pieces of pecans (Unacceptable if I'm paying $1 extra) I ordered corn bread (Disappointing, COLD!!!) I'm not a complainer but I expect to receive what I pay for, now I see how you became rich and it wasn't from selling fried chicken. I suggest the owner pay attention to the quality of her business instead of counting her dollars and spending them Houstons Steak house.
4074	1	a	This is an awesome crossfit box! The trainers are knowledgable and friendly. And the workouts are challenging. I have been to tons of boxes and this is by far my favorite!
4075	1	a	If you need a long distance moving company then you should contact Trico Long Distance Movers. Last year I had to make a long distance move and didn't know who to call or trust. My friend told me about these cross country movers and they were all you could ask for in a moving company. They were on time and loaded up the truck faster then I ever could have imagined. They were also very careful to not to break any of my valuables and to pack the truck in such a way that they would not get damaged on the drive. When we finally arrived at my new home they unloaded it and even asked where I wanted everything put. There were no hidden charges when it came time to settle the bill and I did a quick check of my belongings and there were no damages to report, They are highly recommended if you need a long distance moving company.
4076	1	a	Long distance moves can be both a hassle and stressful. When planning our move across country, my husband and I were careful to select some of the most reliable cross country movers available. I had many questions about the service, all of which were answered to me via phone. I was guaranteed that absolutely no damages would occur during this long distance move. There were no hidden charges, and the movers were punctual. They showed up on time, and in uniform, with smiles on their faces. They made excellent eye contact, and were very receptive to what my husband and I were asking the movers to do. Trico Long Distance Movers were able to follow our instructions when we were around, and they were focused and on task when we were in other rooms. I would definitely recommend Trico Long Distance Movers to any one of my friends or family, because I was completely satisfied with their service.
4077	1	a	I love Which Wich!  I have written a review on the one located in the park road shopping center.  When I saw the sign go up for Which Wich coming to Rivergate, I was so excited that I could have them more often!  We went to WW yesterday for lunch and they were busy, I believe the second or third weekend to be open.  While all of the WW we have been to are small and cramped, this one seems to have a little more space and more outside seating which is a plus.\n\nI love their process of ordering.  It may seem overwhelming if you have not been, but you pick a bag based on the meat or specialty sandwich you want.   Once you select the bag you mark everything you want, put your name on the bag, and hand it to the cashier.  They will then call you up to get your sandwich in your bag.\n\nYesterday I got my favorite, the buffalo chicken and Kevin got the gyro.  Both were great.  I love how they have plenty of options compared to the standard sub shop.  Also, their shakes are good - have had the Oreo shake before.\n\nTwo Complaints:\nThey seemed over staffed, which is good for the sandwich making crew, but they had 4 people on the floor to help out those coming in with questions and to check on people eating.  I really did not need to be checked on 4+ times while having a Wich.  I think once the newness dies down, they can have the proper number working.  \nThey have a loyalty card for getting so many wiches and then you get one free at all of the other locations.  We finished one last time at another location, but they did not have any out at this location to start a new one.
4078	1	a	This was my first experience at the Which Wich and I was favorably impressed. Two things a sandwich shops needs, a. be organized b. have a great tasting sandwich. Which Wich scores on both.\n \nYou grab a bag, and fill out the type of sandwich you want, what bread, toppings you want, etc. Then hand it to the cashier and wait for the sandwich. They were pretty busy, but the line was moving and they had plenty of seating. a. Organized. Check.\n\nThe topping selection was very wide, much more than typical. And for the sandwich taste?... Excellent. I had a Turkey on wheat, hot, with hummus spread, avocado, tomato, spinach. A small was plenty large for me. This was an excellent tasting sandwich. b. Check.\n\nMy daughter got a turkey club, and and vanilla milkshake. Also excellent. \n\nI also got the house chips. They were crunchy, not greasy, and spicy with just the right amount of salt and pepper.
4079	0	a	So far, not a fan...  In their defense, I tried them not long after they opened.  Maybe they were still working out the kinks.  I had heard from friends that the food was great, so we wanted to try them.  Tried to order online, but the newish store was not in the online ordering system yet.  So in I went...  Was unpleasantly surprised that I had to write my own order down.  Wouldn't normally be such a bad thing, but trying to wrangle a 1 year old and fill out order bags for 4 subs was NOT fun...  Then I stood and waited for a half hour (not exaggerating) while they made our subs and there were only 4 people ahead of me in line.  With at least 6 employees making subs, that seemed like a very long time.  Again, factor in the impatient 1 yr old...  They called one of my son's subs out, then three other people, which didn't make sense, since I watched them hang our entire order together.  When I finally had our order and got home, I discovered that there were 6 things incorrect on my sub (including my meat choice), which seems very odd considering that the ingredients are written right on the bag that they are stuffing the sub into...  Bread was stale-ish.  the other ingredients, although not what I ordered, seemed to be good quality.
4080	0	a	Similar to subway, jimmy johns, it's a chain.  No chain should get above a 2 in my opinion.  The ordering system is lame.  The sandwiches are normal for a chain.\n\nThe selection of vegetables is pretty thin.  It's a lousy sub that mushes in your mouth.
4081	0	a	Just OK.  I had a Dragon Roll, Tempura Shrimp and a drink and it was $20.  I can go to a real sushi restaurant with real service instead of a fast food counter and pay less than that.  The eel on the roll was bitter.  I've never experienced that in all my years of sushi eating.  The shrimp in the tempura was tasteless.   Big disappointment all around.
4082	1	a	This place reminds me of when I was a child. When life was simple,  when such simple pleasures as getting a new yo yo, or getting to spend the night at your best friends house was the greatest excitement in your life. I feel as though this fine dining establishment has captured this through teriyaki chicken and tempered California rolls. \n So next time you are in search of nostalgia or maybe you are about to go search for the lost Dutchman's gold, stop by Yogis and fill your gullet with these oriental delights.
4083	1	a	"It's about time good taste found its rightful place from Fort Mill to Elizabeth Ave. For ages, I meant to try Passion8 Bistro in Fort Mill, but anytime we had the time to go, it was on a Sunday (on which they were closed). It must have heard me complaining and decided to come to me. :)\n\nThe stud decided to take me out to dinner Saturday and it was a last minute deal, so we sat in the large bar area at a high top. The space is quite large with the bar separated from the main dining room with a peekaboo architectural wall and a terrace of tables upstairs. The crowd is lively but more mature than the uptown crowd, so think 5Church but grown up. They have some unique cocktails that are quite boozy. I tried one with a pecan orgeat and rum, and hubs had a rye and apple cider cocktail with lavender that was lovely and perfect for fall. \n\nThe food concept is farm to table, and the menu changes regularly. We started with the butternut squash with walnut oil and fried sage.  Then I had the second course of clams. You don't often see just clams on a menu around here, mainly because mussels tend to be more flavorful. The flavor profile was wonderful- the clams were paired with a smooth arugula pesto, apples and pecans with savory white wine foam and some crispy kale on top. I don't know how they get so much flavor in that foam! \n\nHubs had the braised short ribs with ginger braise over mashed potatoes. The short ribs were the most tender he (or I) had ever tasted. It was pretty incredible. The mash was fine, but nothing amazing. We should note, he also ate all of the small, savory rolls because they were so delicious. \n\nI'd echo what Chris H said about the servers- they were all incredibly knowledgable, and apparently had all tried the menu. it's my pet peeve when you ask about a dish and they hadn't tried it. Our server, Amanda, was up there as one of the best servers we'd ever had. Even the guy that brought us utensils was amazingly friendly and informed. Jessica came over and talked with us like we were old regulars. She informed us that they will be open Sundays for brunch in December, along with lunch service.\n\nBottom line: Amazing service, inventive flavorful menu, great interior = one of our new favorite spots. \n\nPS, I don't care if it's trendy, the term \""fluid gel\"" should never, ever, ever grace a menu. It's both unappetizing and pretentious."
4084	1	a	"The fella and I live near the Fort Mill location, but we're so glad they moved to Charlotte! There's so much more room at this location, and now I can actually see the menu.\n\nWe arrived 30 minutes before our Open Table reservation to have a drink at the bar, which is long and spacious and seats about 12 people; there were also a couple of high-top tables near the front window. They had all local beers on tap, but I started with the bartender's recommendation of a Fig Manhattan (cold, bourbon-y, and yummy), and the fella went straight for a Blanton's neat. Bless the bartender's heart, you could hardly see the bourbon in his glass since the pour was so tiny... the fella was not impressed and grumbled a little bit through the beginning of dinner. \n\nWe moved onto the dining room behind the bar (there's also another one to the side of the bar), and it turns out they can curtain off any of the rooms for private parties. There's also another room upstairs for that specific reason, and there's a glassed-off chef's table that looks into the kitchen and appeared to seat about 10 people. The atmosphere of the entire restaurant/bar is dark and cozy with warm lighting and dark brown wood - perfect for a winter night. Although the atmosphere is intimate and upscale, we still felt totally comfortable in jeans, which I appreciate.\n\nOur waitress, Esther, was incredibly knowledgeable about the menu and had definite recommendations when we'd need a judge's ruling. We started with the pork belly (delicious), and then I got the pork of the day as my entree, and the fella got the short ribs. Thankfully, the chef prepared my pork medium rare, so it was incredibly tender, but I think the fella may have won the night since his short ribs were delicious, and his mashed potatoes were \""like crack.\""\n\nThe staff was full of nervous excitement and chattiness, and I'm guessing that'll calm down a little once they hit a groove, but I appreciated the enthusiasm... now they just need to work on their pours. Overall, a great addition to the Elizabeth food scene!"
4085	1	a	Great food and great cocktails! Definitely get the calamari and try the signature drinks. Love the location in Elizabeth!
4086	1	a	I love Publix. Very clean stores with very a very wide selection of just about anything. They have tons of lunch options and their Aprons program is great for inspiration.\n\nYou will have plenty of people offer to help and/or make recommendations. They are really good with service here. \n\nThe only thing that wasn't cool is I let a guy ahead of me in the sushi line and the lady gave him a discount since she knew him ...which is fine, but kind of weird when I bought the same thing directly behind him for more money. Ah nepotism ... \n\nAnyway I like it better than the Teeter in many ways so I think Publix will be my future grocery store.
4087	1	a	"I've been one of Priscilla's many loyal customers for almost two years now. \nNOBODY else ever cuts my hair; simply because nobody does a better job than her.\nShe's an endangered species, a thoroughly competent and personable professional who takes her client happiness and satisfaction to heart. No \""chop-shop\""here!\n\nFive starts because I cannot give TEN.\nHighly recommended!"
4088	1	a	i love this locations of priscys she has been cutting my hair since i was a young adult and it grows so fast and pretty thank you
4089	1	a	Wonderful experience! The food was absolutely incredible. Brad took great care of customers and Danielle was outstanding!!! What a great night! Thanks so much! Definitely recommend!!!
4090	1	a	Great place for lunch, sit outside and enjoy the view even if you're not golfing. The staff is extremely nice and accommodating. The food is extremely good, our favorite is the BLTA Bacon Lettuce Tomato Avocado.
4091	0	a	A nice selection of higher end suitcases and backpacks if you're looking to purchase something that the airlines can toss around while you blast your way through the skies at 400 miles an hour. They have regular suitcases, rollaboards, spinners and the like ranging in size from small to extra large.\n\nPrices, in the other hand, range from medium to high. I don't know about you, but I'm just not going to spend $180 for a rollaboard suitcase unless it comes stuffed with $1 bills.
4092	0	a	"Travelpro makes some great bags, BUT the \""Lifetime Warranty\"" is worthless.  Don't be fooled; the \""Lifetime Warranty\"" has a very limited lifetime.  I paid a lot for a Travelpro carry-on and after several years the fabric at the bottom ripped.  It was not abused at all.  The local Travelpro service center said this was normal wear and tear and they could repair it for $85.  Really, repair a carryon for $85?  I contacted Travelpro directly and they came back with the same thing, specifically \""If a bag has faulty or weak material it will reveal itself very early on in the life of the bag.\""  I see, so the \""Lifetime Warranty\"" is very short.  I am totally bummed out.  Offering a \""Lifetime Warranty\"" then not honoring it is very bad business.  Next time I will buy a more honest brand."
4093	1	a	As an apartment complex manager I had been used a previous company for warranty work and would wait and wait and wait. Once the warranty expired I changed companies and couldn't be happier. Not only am I scheduled quickly, in most situations Justin is able to get the needed parts quickly and I no longer wait weeks for a solution.  \n\nI will never use anyone else for our appliance repair needs!
4094	0	a	This location is brand new in Downtown Summerlin next to Dillard's. I went in last night because it had been awhile since Id gotten my eyebrows and lip threaded, the lady was quick and it didn't hurt too much more than I'd been used to from other salons doing my brows or lip. Since my skin turns really red when I get threading done it's very difficult to see if they miss spots while I am still in the salon. However she didn't put anything on my skin to soothe the irritation like most salons do, thinking nothing of it I went home and put a little facial toner on my skin only to find my eyelids were burning. I looked in the mirror to see why and saw tiny cuts in my skin. Never in the three years I've been getting my eyebrows threaded have I had someone cut the skin on my eyelids while threading my eyebrows. Not to mention she left one eyebrow much thicker than the other.
4095	0	a	I went to the toy box with my son and girl friend and all of us expected a lot more and it was very dark. All of us thought the prices where terrible what ever you do don't go there it is a waste of time.
4096	1	a	I love this shop. It's true that this is not your traditional toy store, but then again there are big box retailers for that. This is more of a treasure trove of cool stuff you might not find elsewhere. We bought some Minecraft toys for my daughter and a collectible Star Wars figure for my son (this one was impossible to find elsewhere). They're not the cheapest store, but they definitely have some outstanding items to explore. And, the staff here is super friendly and always willing to help you out. Definitely worth a visit.
4097	1	a	Great coffee, friendly and welcoming staff and fabulous coffee drinks.Wish them lots of success. Glad to know there is a new coffeehouse, breakfast and lunch place in the area. Love the latte art on the coffee drinks ! Good job Lauren !\n\nAlso had their tuna salad sandwich and tasted very fresh. It was a big sandwich so  wrapped the rest to eat it later at home and it was my dinner!\n\nBottomline..Love the look of the place and the staff could not be friendlier.
4098	1	a	My wife and I went here on a Friday night on the spur of the moment. Not too crowded yet as they have only started opening for dinner a few weeks ago. Limited menu but everything we tried was superb. Shepard's Pie was fantastic. Served beer and wine. A true neighborhood hangout with a bright future.\n\nDan O.
4099	1	a	Sal\u00fad is a welcome addition to the neighborhood, especially across from my favorite yoga studio. The staff was very helpful and blended my juice fresh for me, which I appreciated. I am looking forward to returning soon!
4100	1	a	If you're looking for authentic flavor, but in a hurry this is THE place! My personal favorites are the Carne Asada Fries and some Empanadas!  The fries are so big that it is definitely a two person job!  Everything is fresh and made to order!  Also has lots of healthy options for those of us watching our figures, so that makes it even better for me.  I feel like I get my cheat in without doing any actual damage.  Good stuff all the way around!
4101	1	a	WOW! That was some good authentic Mexican food. The staff was friendly and the food delicious. The serving sizes are filling and I LOVE to eat! Although I was full I wanted more... You guys got me hooked. So glad a friend recommended eating there. \n\nThis place is located inside the boulevard mall food court. DONT PASS THIS PLACE UP! I am salivating like crazy just writing this :-/
4102	0	a	This is the only Total Wine I've ever been dissatisfied with, the other locations seem to understand customer service but this location seems to forget than there are two parties involved in a business transaction.\n\nIt hasn't failed so far that when I come here I will interact with an employee who seems to get some sort of satisfaction out of being rude.  \n\nI advise anyone who visits to not ask for help from an employee because you'll likely end up on the receiving end of a monologue about why don't want whatever you asked for or why they don't have it or about how little you know about alcohol when they know so much more.  Ugh...this place is just exhausting, I need a drink after coming here.
4103	0	a	What a horrid location. Compare this location to others and you will have a very different experience. \nEmployees are very rude. Manager is no better, was in a hurry to get you out of the store and did not care much for getting to the bottom of the problem.\nIf you do need to go to this store, please do yourself a favor do not speak to anyone who works there (even if you are approached). They will find a way to piss you off.
4104	1	a	Best meditranian restaurant in whole entire las vegas.... great customer service, loved it
4105	1	a	Good Persian food with quality basmati rice. Fast and friendly service. Reasonable prices.  \nI highly recommend it to everyone.
4106	1	a	Ohhh, I wish I'd of done this year's ago!!  Thank you Anita Smith!!  I'm a basic kinda gal.  I lost most of my eyebrows due to hypothyroidism.  (Yep.  Listen to your doc!!)  \nI was so afraid to get my eyebrows done but was desperate.  After a very strong recommendation, I went for a consultation with Anita Smith (owner).  You instantly feel comfortable with Anita.  I now have beautiful eyebrows and feel so much better when I look in the mirror.  Thank you Anita!!
4107	1	a	The food is just like the service AWSOME everything about the service is simply amazing gyros the burgers is breathtaking and the chesse steaks are wonderful  .....
4108	1	a	The food was amazing.... i lived in philly for 6 years and this is the real deal. Everything was delicious!!! I defiently will be a regular.
4109	1	a	I'm no expert on cheesesteaks, but whatever I had it tasted good. The owners are (obviously?) from philly and seem to know cheesesteaks, so I'll have to trust in them what a good one tastes like. The meat was flavorful, but I didn't taste much of the cheese personally. I definitely enjoyed the peppers which brought a little spice to the sandwich.\n\nThe sandwich is large enough to be shared among two people, and their fries have a tasty spice seasoning on them, though I wish there was a little more. I think the only thing I might say is the menu needs some streamlining, and the price to make it a combo was a little bit steep (~3.50), though the sandwich price (~$10) was good.
4110	0	a	I have been to this place one before where my cheesesteak was delicious and thinly sliced.  I went back today to pick up lunch for my wife and I. So I picked up the steaks and drove to my wives work (20 min away) when we opened our steaks  we were so disappointed to find that our meat was the consistency of a burger patty. I do not remember this being the case the first time I was their as I am very particular with my cheesesteak. I contacted the place and was told that their meat is never sliced thin and comes in chunks and they cut it up on the cook top. I was under the imprecision that a cheesesteak is thinly sliced? Well lesson learned l. I don't know if they changed their meat or what but I was offered two free steaks on my next visit which I will not be redeeming. \n\nSo If you are looking for a thinly sliced steak this is not the place to go. I will not be returning to this place and still dispute the fact that their meat was always that thick.
4111	0	a	The husband and I were looking for a nearby place we could order quick food from that wasn't the normal pizza joint or Thai place. \n\nAfter looking at Yelp and the reviews for this place, we decided cheesesteaks sounded great. So he went to go get some sandwiches! \n\nIt's located in a Strip mall, oddly situated near a Strip mall church.\n\nThe food ended up being pretty good... we ordered the Bell Pepper Cheesesteak which is freshly prepared with cheese, bellpepper, onions and the cheesesteak. Very filling and tasty.\n\nThe only thing that we were REALLY weirded out about is that my husbands payment was taken by swiping his card via mobile square reader and he was not even given the option for a receipt, which he wanted for his records. \n\nThat ALONE, is enough to make us question if we'll be a repeat customer. Just seemed kinda shady. \n\nI suppose if we pay with cash, we might return.
4112	0	a	"1 star, because the option of negative stars is not an option.\nI WILL NOT BE BACK.\nNo actual website should have been my first clue, and only having a menu available via Facebook is even worse.\nGuess what? Not everyone on the planet has a  Facebook account!\nI went in the \""store\"" to place an order, and as soon as I walked in, I noticed NO other customers inside.\nIt doesn't even seem like a business to me, more like a failed experiment, and someplace to bring in the workers family, and friends, and kids.\nI ordered anyway, hoping that the food would be good, and when I handed my card to the man that took my order, he raised his voice at the woman next to him \""Where's my phone?\""\nWeird? Yes. \nShe brings him his phone, and swipes my card with his Square reader, and hands me my card, and tell me that my food would be ready shortly.\nAs for Square, I did not sign anything,or provide my PIN, nor was I given the option to.\nOK. I sit. I wait.........................\nAt least the woman that made my sandwich wore gloves.\nAfter less than 10  minutes, the same man tells me my order is ready, and I stand up, grab my food, and leave.\nWhen I got home, I found no receipt in the bag, and start to question this \""businesses\"" professional practices, once again.\nThe cheese steak was mediocre at best, greasy, and the bread was soggy.\nMaybe because I am not \""Straight from Philly\"" I was not impressed with the food.\nI can say, that i have spent some time in Philly, and have had MUCH better cheesesteaks there.\nThere are much better cheesesteaks in town, and I recommend trying any other place than this one."
4113	0	a	"After posting a less than favorable review on this business, the owner felt the need to reply to my original review saying that he will \""pray for me\"".... which isn't something a professional business owner should say to his customers, especially when word of mouth is one of the best proven methods for advertising.\n\nThe food was actually quite good enough to consider eating there again, but sadly, based on his awful attitude and lack of empathy for my less-than-stellar experience, he made me decide not only to NOT eat there ever again, but to make sure none of my friends do either. \n\nFor a business that hasn't been open that long, you'd think he'd have a better understanding of what customer service (and YELP) is all about."
4114	1	a	"Straight From Philly is awesome! Scott, the owner, is super nice and chill and accommodating. He's actually born and raised from Philly too. I came here with a group of glucose deprived friends, several of which are actually watching their diets but decided to cave after hearing how good this place sounded. It did not disappoint. \n\nVenue: Straight From Philly is somewhat hard to find. It's on the northwest corner of American Pacific and Stephanie. As of now, there isn't a big sign yet because it's still so freshly opened. Follow Furniture World and Bank of Nevada. If you see these businesses, you're in the right area. The restaurant itself is pretty small. Just a few tables. \n\nFood: All 5 of us got some rendition of the philly cheese steak sandwich. The deal on Tuesday, when we went, was 3 free toppings. You can choose from mushrooms, bell peppers, banana peppers, jalapeno peppers, hot cherry, bacon, and cheese (\""extra meat\"" is not included). The sandwiches are huge. A regular steak without cheese comes out to be $8.05 with tax. The food was delicious, fresh, and of high quality. We watched Scott prepare the meat himself. They were big slices of steak, and he chopped them right up on the grill. I ordered the philly steak (which comes with grilled onions) along with 3 free toppings of mushrooms, bell peppers, and banana peppers. Did not regret it one bit. The bread was nice and soft, the proportion of meat to bread was hugely in favor of meat, and it tasted great. We also shared an order of regular fries, an order of garlic parmesan fries, and asked for atomic sauce on the side. The regular fries were really good - nice and crispy and well seasoned. I wouldn't order the parmesan fries again. They weren't really anything spectacular; just some garlic parm sprinkled on top. \n\nIce cream: To celebrate the grand opening, for a limited time with any purchase you get free Thrifty's ice cream! I'm not sure if the flavors will change up, but today they had vanilla, pistachio, rocky road, chocolate malted crunch, pecan praline, and strawberry cheesecake. Scott was really generous with the scoops too. \n\nI will definitely come back. And this quaint little establishment is not open on Sundays, so bring your appetite the other days of the week. Thanks for bringing a bit of Philly to Vegas! :)"
4115	1	a	Tucked away on Stephanie, the sandwich is very good and the fries are terrific. No prices on the menu is odd and they apparently charge for add-ons - onions, sweet & hot peppers. Worth a 2nd try.
4116	0	a	Went for lunch with 8 of us.  We requested indoor seating.  We were seated in a room with garage doors that opened up the west side of the room to the outside patio.  We were bothered through the entire meal by pesky flies.  Our meals were brought to  3 of us as the rest waited over 15 minutes before being served.  I ordered the three tacos.  They were served in soft shells.  The chicken taco had dried chicken sitting on too much shredded lettuce.  The shrimp taco had mushy shrimp also with too much shredded lettuce.  The beef taco tasted too spicy and had very little shredded beef.  Those who ordered the classic burger said it was plentiful but nothing special.  I recommend staying away from this place.
4117	0	a	This place is the worst,  they deserve NO STARS but Yelp wouldn't allow that. Terrible service,  bad food. DON'T GO!!!
4118	0	a	Awful.  Went for a teachers recognition event. The food was tasteless.  The wings were not cooked enough and still raw inside. There was fried stuff that looked like it came from Costco. The pasta was tasteless and overcooked. Most people filled up on salad. It was a paid event. I should have just bought a gift for my child's teacher. I will take my business elsewhere.
4119	1	a	Went in for the first the first time today. There's an indoor/outdoor area that was nice. The service was good and the food was tasty. I had the kale salad with chicken and the chicken egg rolls. Both were yummy. Only reason it wasn't 5 stars is that the decor was very boring and it looked empty and there were way too many flys around. Will go back to try it again.
4120	0	a	The Iguana Macks has upgraded a bit and changed its name.  This includes a new menu.  Had the Grilled Cheese with Tomato Bisque Soup.  The sandwich was great, the soup, not so much! The soup was orange in color and tasted nothing like tomato. When I inquired about the soup I was told that is normal.  My advice is to avoid the tomato soup. The staff was friendly and courteous, but slow.  The real kicker was when they decided not to honor the frequent lunch card they had just handed out a few weeks ago. Goodbye Iguana Macks....Social Box I won't be back!!!
4121	0	a	The girlfriend and I decided to try this place because we always drive past it on Alma School. We didn't really know what to expect, but had checked out the menu prior to heading out.\n\nUpon arriving it looked like a pretty cool place from the lobby, but once we were seated we realized the place was pretty basic. The booth we were seated at was dirty. Crumbs on the table and the seats. We had to clear them off ourselves. Someone (not a waitress) came and took our drink order because we had been sitting a while without being attended to. Immediately after, our actual waitress came and took our drink order, but I told her it was already taken.\n\nThe girlfriend ordered a Moscow Mule, it was $9. After I tried it, didn't think it was worth that much. On top of that, the waitress asked for a credit card to hold in case they didn't get the glasses back. I get that people steal glasses but come on. \n\nI ordered the Queso Burger and the girlfriend ordered some sort of chicken sandwich. We both agreed they were mediocre at best. In fact, I later told her that the burgers consistency reminded me of a frozen burger I once bought at the grocery store. \n\nThe waitress was nice, and I can't blame everything on her. They're working out the kinks. We just weren't that impressed, and will probably not be going back.
4122	0	a	The bar will not make it drinks are way do high for that area. Lower your drink prices and bring the bread back and live patio music. During happy hour I ordered  ONE appetizer and ONE fish fry on Friday with 2 drinks came to $50.00  will never go back. Drink was not worth $9.00 a piece I should have tasted some booze in that small tall glass. Also are water jar was warm and so was the water.
4123	0	a	Iguana Mack's was a dive with good prices and decent food, the Social Box is an upgraded dive with Scottsdale prices . I'll give it 2 stars because to food was good, but the most  memorable part of the food was the high prices. I have to mention the 9 dollar weak drinks. \nI say it is still a dive since the floors needed sweeping and tables were dirty. Increase the quality and maybe I'll come back during happy hour.
4124	1	a	The food here is really good and perfectly priced for a casual  fun night with friends!  The drinks are generously blended and the atmosphere is engaging.  The servers are prompt and attentive, too!
4125	0	a	My review is strictly based on service. I've been in the bar/restaurant industry for 10+ years and if I ever got caught talking the way these bar tenders were behind the bar, I'm sure I would have been fired. Very unprofessional. They were cussing, joking around and not taking into regard the customers who may be listening. The drink (Moscow Mule) was good. The bar tenders next door at Dos Gringos may be more professional than these ones.
4126	0	a	My review is similar to others I've read for this restaurant.  We went on a Saturday evening to celebrate a Girlfriends Birthday.  There were 12 of us and we didn't have a reservation, so we were happily surprised when they were able to seat us right away.  There was only 1 other table and a few people at the bar.  The waitress took our drink orders fairly quickly, but it took over an hour for her to take our dinner orders and I believe that only happened because one of us asked her to do so.  The food took a considerable amount of time considering there were only a few other people in there.  We were all pretty satisfied with our food.  The appetizers were tasty and my Husband especially loved the egg rolls (which were presented beautifully as well) and we were all pretty happy with our entrees.  Props to the chef!  Sadly however, the service was just awful.  My glass was dry on several occasions and it was difficult getting anyone's attention for a refill and once we were finished eating it took nearly another hour to get our bill.  I just don't understand why there was such a lack of service.  From start to finish over 3 hours had passed which I find unacceptable.  There are some positive changes made to this restaurant decor with the new ownership, I just don't see it lasting if they don't make some radical changes in the staff.  My advice... Keep the cook and fire everyone else!!
4127	0	a	Had the chicken alfredo it was so very bland. No flavor at all. I will say however the clam chowder was great.
4128	1	a	Thank you for honoring the check-in deal, SOBO! My experience here was pleasant. Was actually in the plaza to go to the restaurant next door but noticed this gem so I quickly Yelped and saw that I bookmarked it so my bf and I decided to change our plans. Proving that the exterior is inviting. The restaurant has a warm tone to it at the entrance with a large waiting area with a cute vintage couch and some art. We were greeted and seated right away. The menu is pretty overwhelming, we had a hard time deciding what to order but the fact that we came during happy hour helped us narrow it down. We decided to start with the mac n cheese and cashew calamari. The calamari was my favorite item of the hour. At first we were disappointed that it didn't come with any sauce (we're big sauce people) but upon tasting, it didn't need it at all. Excellent. The mac and cheese was good, but nothing special. Next, we ordered the Meat, Meat, Meat pizza. This too was just okay. A little soggy. I wish we went with the SOBO Bianco though. I liked this place enough to come back and try the other things I had my eye on. Not blown away but not disappointed either. SOBO is a great new addition to the neighborhood.
4129	1	a	Being new to crossfit, I've always been intimidated to step in and try it out. That is, until I found Crossfit Embody! From day one I have found an extreme sense of teamwork. Everyone here works together and doesn't stop encouraging until the last person is done with their workout. Coach John and Coach Jeff's approach to fitness is unlike any other I've seen or tried. They are friendly and helpful, and will push you to your max with an extreme focus on technique to minimize injuries. Each new student is placed in a 6 course foundations class so that you are able to learn step by step techniques and foundations of crossfit at a slow pace and not feel bad for the advanced athletes that already know the basics.\n\nUnder Coach John's direction and dietary suggestions I was able to lose 16 pounds in just 12 weeks and the constant change of workout routines keeps me motivated to continue. If you are looking for a fun and effective way to get fit and healthy give Crossfit Embody a try! You won't regret it!
4130	0	a	I completely understand new places having some growing pains and the introductory period with ups and downs but this place just isn't very good. I work in the business so I know what to expect at a new place (slow service,longer wait times,possible mistakes) but my reason for the 2 star review has nothing to do with those things.. I wasn't expecting a five star cuisine as a know this was a chain. Me and my girlfriend got a $5 off welcome coupon in the mail so we thought we would try it out for happy hour. Waitress comes over seems nervous that's totally fine and expected, I ask what draft beers they have she only knows about 3... I'm not expecting you to have them all memorized but wouldn't you want to have that all written down seeing that your a sports bar? Not a huge deal but a little frustrating having to wait for the back and forth and her finding out what beers they have. Then I ask what their happy hour specials they have. Doesn't know.... Something else I would think they would be teaching in training. These are just basic server things you should know and has nothing to do with it being a new place. Next the food not very good.. I had steak taquitos appetizer steak was chewy and dry it looked like they just slapped a bunch of cheese on top and it wasn't super busy either.. I got the sliders as an entree they weren't terrible but they weren't good either. In terms of the time the food took it wasn't long at all so that's a plus but it just wasn't very good also for happy hour beer $4 is nothing that would keep me going their solely for that purpose as their are better places in the area for happy hour. Overall just not very good
4131	0	a	2 of us wanted to try this place for dinner on a Saturday evening. We were told 20-30 minute wait when they had at minimum of 12 tables open that we counted. Can't foresee trying this place again.
4132	0	a	I called and made a togo order tonight for 10pc wings with blackened cajun flavor. i was not impressed, the wings were not crispy enough and the flavor did not tast like cajun at all, it ws more like teriyaki. When you walk in it was like you were drowing in the ocean. i understand that is the theme but it was really to much. staff was freindly and kind, and the intreaer was clean. this is not a place that i would go for chicken wings though. i might try this place again but have something different.
4133	0	a	First of all, they aren't doing happy hour appetizers... Stupid... Why ADVERTISE a happy hour?\n\nSecondly, the wings are so dry! They aren't that big either...\n\nThirdly, the Garlic Parmesan fries are cold, hard, and soggy, even the replacement order we got... The food just isn't good at all :-/\n\nFourth, it's sooooo sooooo loud you can't have a conversation\n\nTheir saving grace? The people are very friendly...\n\nGood luck staying alive...!
4134	0	a	Wanted to try the new place in the hood and try the wings.  For a dollar a wing, they were quite disappointing.  CK's down the street has wings of similar quality for .40 cents less  during regular hours and .60 cents per wing on happy hour.  I guess they need to pay for the televisions and new decorations in the place.  Beers were a little pricey as well given the location.  Heard that the owner of the property is the father of the guy who previously launched a place there so that may reflect that and affect the prices.  Poor business planning. Not likely to come back.  Should develop a better\\winning approach.  Available for consulting as needed.  Server was nice but overall experience did not meet the hype.  Anyone's guess as to what will occupy this place next.
4135	0	a	"Overpriced and underwhelming CHAIN restaurant. We tried a number of things on the menu and I thought everything was pretty bad, except maybe the fish and chips. The boneless wings were the frozen over-breaded type, hard as a rock. The \""jumbo wings\"" were nothing special and at $1.00 apiece, a rip off. Wing sauces nothing special. Red Lobster meets Bahama Breeze meets Applebee's. Happy hour specials were nothing exciting. Tried to charge us $5.99 EACH for a side of onion rings and fries that were supposed to be included with our wing entree order. Even if they weren't included, $5.99 is a LOT for a side of onion rings and/or fries. I won't return, even though I live close by. Disappointing."
4136	0	a	"Ordered the sampler appetizer and asked for double boneless wings instead of shrimp bc I hate seafood. Waited quite a while for the food. When it came out I questioned whether I got double chicken wings bc it looked like a normal order but the bartender insisted it was \""based off weight and shrimp is lighter.\"" Upon starting to eat, my food was cold. Not even warm, just cold. Keep in mind- the restaurant had a total of 4 parties!! No reason to get cold food!! The bartender said he would get me a new order which I thanked him for doing for me. When I got the new order, he forgot I asked for no shrimp.. Here's the kicker: I GOT THE SAME AMOUNT OF BONELESS CHICKEN WINGS as I did when I asked for no shrimp even though the second plate had shrimp. The food was mediocre at best. Over priced. Bartender didn't know prices or if food was on happy hour.. Will not be back."
4137	0	a	Horrible horrible horrible save your money and go to the circle k across the street and get a hot dog it's better!!! Ordered their sampler was saturated with butter and that's saying a lot when a fat girl complains about butter, was Paula Dean in the kitchen??? Ordered a steak medium it was over done and charred!!! They took it off the bill and said they would give me a coupon really email me if u want to coupon not going back!!!
4138	1	a	Super friendly staff. Friday night happy hour until 7. Got the Hurricane drink and it was delicious . Super nice bartender. Atmosphere was great. They played great music. They were super busy so we sat at the bar and got great service. The chipotle raspberry wings were amazing.
4139	0	a	Service was horrible. Took forever to get a server. Wings were undercooked. Won't come back
4140	0	a	Went there with a few buddies the other week on football Sunday. Wings were ok but extremely over priced. Waited a longtime for the order as well. Bucket of beers was reasonable. \n\nIt's going to be tough for them to complete against Native New Yorker when they do $.49 wings on Sunday. I would of paid half the price for better wings if I would of gone there.
4141	0	a	We here for lunch on a Friday afternoon. Very clean and bright. There were a few people at the bar and they look to be having a great time. We were seated in the back of the restaurant and the seats were a little uncomfy. \n\nThe waiter came with a smile and took our drink order. I had the Citrus Ice Tea which was pretty good. Mrs. Had the regular tea which was decent. We then proceeded to order the Firecracker Shrimp. There was a little too much batter and it wasn't as spicy as anticipated. But we ate it. The sauce that accompanied it was great. \n\nI then ordered ten wings with the Garlic Parmesan sauce and also the Trifecta sauce (combo of three dry rubs). Mrs. Order the boneless wings with the salt and vinegar sauce. When the wings came out I was surprised to see little to no sauce or seasoning on them. Having dry rubs before and not really being able to see the seasoning, I figured I would be able to taste it. Wrong!! It was like I was eating chicken straight out the fryer. They were pretty blah. And the boneless wings...too much breading no flavor. Her side salad was great though. \n\nIf I go back I would definitely get a wet sauce and try it at happy hour.
4142	0	a	We have been here about 5 times since they opened and every time we come in something changes at first they had happy hour food now they dont because thr the kitchen can't keep up. Sad thing is their food isn't bad. They need to get their act together or they won't last just like every other place in this location
4143	0	a	I was SO excited for this place to open. I've only been in once, but I was pretty disappointed. The service was great, the inside is good with lots of seating and lots of tv's to watch sports, but the food?? I was not impressed! I first ordered the buffalo chicken bruschetta, we had to send it back because it was so bad (we still had to pay for it when we didn't even eat any of it) I then ordered the steak taquitos, better than the bruschetta but not still not great, it was so bland and boring. My husband ordered the wings, which he enjoyed and said that they were a great size. Next time I'm definitely sticking with be wings!
4144	0	a	Bloody Mary was good! Service was a bit slow at times.  Food is warm to touch. Needs to be hotter, temperature wise. Would be a good idea to have stickers on the wing orders so that we can determine what flavor we r eating.  Overall atmosphere was fine. Needs color on the walls a bit plain.
4145	1	a	I actually haven't eaten here yet,  just order to-go. The wings are great and the fact that I can play with flavors and mix them,  is awesome.  The salads are also a good size,  I definitely recommend the steak, although it's a wing place,  the butter parmesan sauce on the sirloin is delicious. You do have to keep in mind it is a brand new establishment,  working out the kinks. I do recommend it to a lot of people.
4146	1	a	Wings are excellent! Tried fish and steak too, steak was ok but not the greatest! This location needs to work on service! Too long of wait for attention from wait staff!
4147	0	a	"My husband and I really wanted to like this place. From the outside it looks like it may have potential. Upon entering the door our first impression didn't change that much until we were seated. We immediately noticed tables were not adequately spaced for even the smallest of people to comfortably sit. We went on with the evening and ordered our drinks and the sampler. A few minutes later another table is sat behind beside us. My 1 year old sleeping in my lap and I were then pushed out of our chair so someone else could sit down. My son and I no longer had a place to sit so my family moved to a different table on our own. Shrugging off the table move we continued waiting for our food. The waiter refilled our drinks timely but left the empty glasses on the table. My sons food came first. We had ordered a cheeseburger with all the fixings. To our dismay the burger had nothing but meat, cheese, and bun. A little while later our food came and after the whole evening seemingly going shitty we were hoping the food would be enough to salvage the evening. We were wrong. The food can only be best described as \""meh\"" with a side of disappointing. The honey bbq dressing was runny and not appetizing. The breaded shrimp was mainly batter and the popcorn chicken could've broken a tooth. The fried pickles while sub par compared to what you can get in the Deep South heart of Texas were the highlight of the sampler. We took the check after the sampler. We really wanted to like this place. Unfortunately, my husband and I give them 3 months . We were asked to come back and give them another try. If they are still here in a year we may give it another shot. But until then we will be eating dinner elsewhere."
4148	0	a	Two words come to mind that best describe my experience: thoroughly disappointing. The ambience is great - the decor is good and the waitstaff were nice enough. If I could end the review there this would be a 5 star review... but oh, the food. \n\nI ordered a staple, Pad Thai. I'm not sure where they went wrong but it was terrible all around. Instead of choosing your protein (as is common with the dish), this chef is confused - they include chicken, shrimp, and something else I couldn't quite make out; the flavor was just 'off' from what Pad Thai should be - that's as best as I can describe it. The spice level also left much to be desired - I ordered 'Thai Hot', the spiciest they have and the dish packed as much punch as a wet noodle, no pun intended. Lastly, the consistency of the noodles was just wrong - either it was too soggy or too wet and the noodles were round instead of flat so it didn't feel quite right in the mouth. \n\nAnd the price? At $14.95, this was the most expensive Pad Thai I've ever had; I wish I could say it was worth it. \n\nOn our way out (based on what I could see), I noticed that they didn't have a single Asian/Thailander working in the kitchen - it just seemed like a bunch of Southerners trying to mimic Asian cuisine; maybe that's why the food didn't have an 'authentic' taste. Maybe I'm being way too harsh/overly critical, but I'll tell you this - this is the first review I've ever given less than 4 stars; that's saying something. \n\nI really wanted to love this place, I did (especially since we live across the street from it), but based on tonight's performance, they're going to have a really hard time winning me back. \n\nOh and did I mention they don't have a lunch service? A Thai place with no lunch - that's like McDonald's with no breakfast.
4149	0	a	"My wife and I were very excited to see that Basil would be opening new doors within the Stonecrest Shopping Center since we had such great experiences at the Uptown (Church Street) location.  \n\nWisely we waited about two weeks until they got the \""bugs\"" out with their dinner service but couldn't resist and decided on take out.  Wife got the Shrimp Red Curry where I got the Basil Duck.  The Red Curry was very diluted where is was almost like curry water and the taste was just \""off\""; the shrimp were nicely cooked and love that they remove the shell of the tail for easier eating! My duck was also \""off\"" on the normal flavor but our first time doing take out at the new location was masked by our excitement of them being closer to us! \n\nThen we actually did a weekend dinner trip with our two young kids. My wife and I got the same dishes and they were again \""off\"", actually the two dishes were awful at best! I am trying to be nice here but the Red Curry was so salty that it was nothing like we ever had.  The Basil Duck was very dry and rubbery (gave new meaning to a rubber duck!).  The kids shared a fish dish which they enjoyed and it was the best thing we ordered.  \n\nI saw the owner there and noticed that he was visiting various tables within earshot and heard him apologizing to them about their food.  Service was good but they brought out our rice way too early where the bowls of rice were cold by the time our dishes were delivered.  \n\nBeing a glutton for punishment, I did a simple take out again when they family was away; ordered the Pad-Thai...  I cannot say enough how disappointed I was!!! It had no flavor and it was very very dry!\n\nWe love Basil so we are going to give it another try in a few weeks; we are in high hopes that they will make improvements to be similar to their Uptown location.  Fingers (chop-stixs) crossed!!!"
4150	0	a	When I arrived in Fort Mill, this place was so hyped I literally thought it was God's gift of thai cuisine. Everyone I talked to raved about the food, the service, and the decor among other things. Having had some pretty legit thai food myself, I braced myself. Coming into the restaurant looks very impressive. A very modern decor with an incredible bamboo-wood-thing ceiling. The lighting is perfect and it's not too loud even when crowded. However, that didn't deter my disappointment in all other aspects of the restaurant.\n\n- Service\nThe service is on and off. They are great when taking your order, getting your drinks/food in a reasonable time, and answering questions, but fairly slow when you need something like another drink, ordering additional items, or basically getting their attention when they aren't intending to come. The owner is very nice though.\n\n- Food\nHere's where the bulk of my smh experience comes in. I ordered the Pad Thai the first time I went and then the Pad See-eu the second time. Both were extremely dry, lacked flavor, and generally just tasted like it came out of the microwave. We had some shrimp and chicken appetizers, both not impressive, as well as some curries around the table which were decent but nothing spectacular. One cool thing is that they have a spice tray which is a nice presentation, but they are just basic spices that don't really add anything distinct (which is something you would expect from a place like this).\n\nOverall.. The only reason I came back a 2nd time is because someone insisted we go, but otherwise I will never come back again.
4151	0	a	I am a fan of the uptown Basil location and was excited to see this location open up closer to home. Overall the meal was a huge disappointment and I don't plan on returning. \n\nWe ordered pad thai, tom yum soup, sweet and sour tofu, basil rolls, egg rolls and lettuce chicken wraps. The chicken in the lettuce wraps had actually gone bad - the smell was noticeably off and we had to send it back. Basil rolls were good but small for the price - just two pieces with hardly any shrimp. Same with the egg roll - we couldn't even taste egg. The sweet and sour tofu was the nights major miss - it had absolutely zero flavor. The sweet and sour sauce added nothing to the dish and we had to heap on our own spices from the spice tray. Pad thai also had almost no flavor as well. \n\nService was brusque and spotty. The prices do not match the food and service and ambiance was considerably less warm than the uptown location. Will get my thai fix at thai first instead.

The pizza took 5 minutes to cook which is way too long considering a regular PH or PJ pizza takes 8 minutes. The bottom was only slightly brown nor browned cheese so the oven must be around 425 or so, they need to crank the over to 575 or higher. The problem running that long is that the center of the pizza was doughy and slimy. This to me is not a good concept, being in the outlet mall they may not survive the off season.
4153	1	a	I am a fan of Fired Pie and this store is a nice addition to the Tanger outlet area considering there is not really anything in the way of actual eateries there beyond snacks. The store is new, the staff is new so give it a chance. I love the concept of building my own salads and pizzas just like at Chipotle or Subway. Looking forward to going back! Pizzas were very good though and the roasted veggie salad was a perfect blend. Looking forward to improvements on the comfort level of the staff with the product and the place will be great!
4154	1	a	Build your own pizza while watching them do it in front of you.\n\n- Very  in expensive\n- great quality\n- very generous with the toppings\n- pizza was ready in almost 5 minutes\n\nDefinitely recommend for anyone that likes pizza.
4155	1	a	Yelp gets freaky was a FREAKIN Awesome time from start until this PREGGO finished. The security was extremely friendly & compassionate with everyone that walked up. The vendors were professional & everything taste amazing. Unfortunately I was not able to drink any liquor but the liquor vendors were nice enough to give me chasers on ice = Score. \nMy plus 1 says the liquor mixed drinks were awesome & she thanked me tremendously for bringing her with. Did I mention the costumes & the candy/Yelp bag station where I got an awesome snack bag to munch on during my ride home. \nThanks Nikki & Yelp for such a good time.\nThe DJ was off the chain I almost shook my baby out LoL
4156	1	a	This was soooo much fun! I had a blast! The food was great, the host was awesome, the DJ's were truly on point and the free beer was amazing.\n\nI had my favs and some disappointments. \n\nThe worst food goes to Emeril Lagasse! Yuck! Spit it out!  \n\nBest food goes to Pint Central!! Way to go!!!! The avocado-fries amazing idea but; the bacon wrapped chicken and fresh mozzarella forget about. It was out of this world good! Owner told me his mom hand pulls the mozzarella and then they cook it the whole thing on the BBQ.\nhttp://pint-central.com/\n\n\nTapSnap had a great concept and probably the most interactive booth! \n\nThe Uber Booth was pretty cool, who doesn't like corn hole. Hope I Win the gift credits!\n\nThe dj's played sick music all night and really deserved applause. \n\nNicky W. and the Beards BeCause did a wonderful thing. \nhttp://www.beardsbecause.com/index.html\nhttp://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=E43QxgV87Ij6KxMCHcijKw\n\nLenny boy brewing co.  Took the best beverage and I kept going back for more. The guys were great and very informed. \nhttp://www.discoverlennyboy.com/\n\nHate, I missed the summer one, it will be the last. \n\nLooking forward to the next one!
4157	1	a	"Another great party! I love Yelp, and I love Yelpers!\n\nWe got there more than a half-hour late but luckily things were just getting awesome. So many cool people in crazy costumes, and more awesome vendors showcasing their amazing food and drinks. I rolled the dice at the \""Eight\"" table and got six! So I got the hottest pepper there is with the sushi. And God it was hot!! I'm Korean, and I've had hot Indian, Mexican, all types of Asian food but that was the second hottest stuff I've ever had in my life. It was painful for a while. The point is that I had to chug down at least five shots of whatever I could get to even start feeling better. Luckily, that made me feel better. A lot better. LOL\n\nThe DJ was really good too. Oh, did I mention that the temporary associates were great as well? I think their names were Dan and Hugo? Sounds familiar... Anyway, great job Nikki! You did it again! Thank you!"
4158	1	a	What a cool experience!!! The vendors were great! Thank you for such a fun time!!! One suggestion would be to add a cash bar somewhere so I can get a whole drink to hold but other then that perfect!
4159	1	a	This was my first Yelp event and I had a great time! Delicious food, great drinks, fun atmosphere... I met a lot of great people. Cannot wait to go to more Yelp events in the future. Great job Nikki and staff!
4160	1	a	Did the factory ever get freaky!  There were so many good costumes!  From fishnet scarecrow, to one of the best ET costumes I have ever seen, and hot damn that jellyfish can sting me anytime!  The eats were fantastic even though I pussed out on the carolina reaper pepper.  The drinks were flowing and big ups to D9 for giving adult sized cups!  Too bad I had to leave early otherwise the electric boogaloo would have been broken out.  Well done cutie mcdimpletons!
4161	1	a	Another awsome Yelp event!!!
4162	1	a	First off, big kudo's and thank you to Nikki.  This event was 100% HOMERUN!\n\nThe weather was perect, the set up was perfect, the vendors were all happy and having a blast.  It is amazing how personable they were, taking their time and proudly explaining their dish.  \n\nSince there are 46++++ reviews on this totally fabulous night, I will not go into detail on the food.  I just wanted to drop in and say ----- some of the vendors are former Yelp event host and some are not, some I have heard of, some I have not......  But, this event has made me aware of some totally awesome joints in the Queen City that I would have never known about!!!!!!\n\nThank you Yelp!!!!!   and Nikki :-)
4163	1	a	SO MUCH AWESOME!! What can I say that hasn't already been said... I'll keep this short and sweet :) Everything was so well planned and executed by our lovely CM, Nikki W. and vendors! The weather was on point to spend a night out at the NC Music Factory noshing and imbibing the night away. My fave... The sliders from Street Spice!! I'll be stalking that food truck soon... Huge shout out to Nikki for putting together this awesome night and all the businesses that came out to dish out their goods!
4164	1	a	John Shimer is the best. Honest and will take care of you! You cannot do better.
4165	0	a	I've been there three times now, and most likely won't be going back.  The food is decent but overpriced (IMHO), and the service is slow, which is okay if you're just killing time before a Suns game, but not so much when you're on a work lunch break.  \n\nI first got a turkey & cheese sandwich.  Well, I should say I paid for turkey and cheese, but they forgot the cheese (which they charge extra for).  The sandwich was literally bread and turkey, period.  The turkey itself was good, but overall the sandwich was incredibly plain (and $9 bucks for the half sandwich after tax).  And the wait was about 10 minutes.\n\nThe next time I went to check out their breakfast.  I was the only person in the restaurant, so you'd think it would be quick.  Nope.  It must have taken 3-4 minutes before the cook even came out.  Then another 8-10 minutes to cook two eggs, a slice of ham, and hash browns, and another couple of minutes to get someone else to wrap it all up and hand it to me.  \n\nThe last time I got a bowl of chili and a hot dog.  Over $9 bucks, and another ridiculously long wait, made more aggravating by the fact that there were 2-3 employees just standing around.   When I got back to my office and opened up the bag, realized they didn't give me (or offer to give me) ketchup, mustard, or anything else for the hot dog.  \n\nIt's too bad.  I really wanted to like this place.  I predict it won't last very long, but hopefully I'm wrong.
4166	1	a	The sandwich was great had a Ruben and my fried had the pastrami sandwich. .I think the Ruben could have used a bit more pastrami. .or I guess the next time I'll order the bigger whole sandwich.   Lol. .my friends half pastrami was stacked..little pricey with the Ala cart menu..definitely not a place to eat every day or you'll break the bank. .
4167	0	a	This is the worst Duncan Donuts I have ever been to. The girl taking my order did not know how to ring anything in and had to ask how to do everything. It took over 5 minutes to ring in two sandwiches and two coffees. I asked for cream cheese on my sandwiches and they charged us for two 8 ounce cream cheeses which came out to over 5 dollars extra. There was no more than 2 ounces smeared on each of the sandwiches. When I received our iced coffees, they were luke warm. I live within two miles of this location and by the time I got home there was no ice left. The hash browns were cold and the bagel on the sandwich was hardly toasted, very doughy, and stale. They also gave us the wrong bagels and had to remake our sandwiches. Instead of trying to make their mistakes right, they acted like we were an inconvenience. Do not go to this Duncan Donuts. There are two much better coffee shops across the street.
4168	0	a	Went inside thinking it would be faster! NOT\n5 cars went through drive through and 7 orders inside (2 people left) over 30 minutes waiting to place order; glad you have good drive through business.\nGet it together, you have 1 cashier she has to get the donuts plus run register. While 2nd cash register sits idle by.\nWon't visit this place again.
4169	0	a	I've been going to this one frequently since it opened as it is just around the corner and has a drive through.   Pros: great coffee and donuts, tasty sandwiches.  Cons: dreadful drive thru service.  At least 6 times out of ten, they screw up the order.  Wrong items, wrong quantity, or they are out of ingredients ( no biscuits, sprinkles).  And they don't wrap each donut individually if you get less than 6 so the frosting sticks together.  This location needs to get competent staff.
4170	0	a	Unfriendly staff and horrible hot coffee the iced coffee is good apparently they can't sell coffee because they are always giving it away for free I like free stuff but you get what you pay for and I would go somewhere else for coffee
4171	0	a	The juices are pretty tasty, but their customer service is poor and this is why they don't deserve more stars. Located in an upscale area they refuse hundred dollar bills.
4172	1	a	Definitely 5 stars for every single aspect of this business. \n\nWe are vegan, gluten-free and very health conscious. This is the only juice/smoothie/a\u00e7a\u00ed place  in Summerlin that provides all of our needs and, despite other reviews that I read, the customer service is always very good.
4173	0	a	saw this place on facebook and heard from a friend it was open. there was no address on their website or on google only on facebook which i didn't learn until after i had tracked the place down. they also have no phone number. they have been open for about a week but apparently no one knows yet because the place was almost empty on a weekend night. they have a great selection of video games and systems to play all around the bar but i had to track someone down to figure out how to get games. the door staff was unhelpful when i got there. but they do have a ton of games to pick out of and it is fun to play the ones i don't have. ordered food and the pizza was as expensive as the restaurants on mill but it tasted like bad bar food. i had 2 specialty drinks and both were great too. bartender was funny. will go back and try it again and update my review because the place is cool and it doesn't charge to play games but because kind of a letdown and unhelpful staff my first trip was a bad one.
4174	0	a	"I'd give it a one star, however, I think the concept is a cool idea. BUT...it could've been done better. \n\nThe \""re-grand opening\"" was a total loss...it was packed...however their system failed them and they were VERY slow at getting drinks out! If you wanted a beer, then great! but a mixed drink...forget that! My friend had to wait almost an HOUR for her drink! Plus, when they gave her the drink, they just walked away...it's like they were giving them out for free! Sheesh. \n\nWe were not happy...plus there was barley any room to move about....ehh oh well..not going back...."
4175	0	a	"First let me stress, this is a place to play games! They are uninterested in giving quick, adequate service. I have given this place several chances...I've been there five times before writing this. I am now convinced that the owner hired his gaming buddies and did not actually hire bartenders..most look pathetically helpless behind the bar and are unable to answer basic questions as \""what beers are on tap?\"" I've waited about an average of twenty minutes standing at the bar while they are 1/4 full to have my tab closed out, each time being reassured that \""this never happens. I've received better service from more crowded bars on mill and I can honestly say that this place has consistently given me terrible service over several visits."
4176	0	a	I love the concept, but this place is so frustrating! Hire a freaking hostess! Above all get bartenders who can MOVE! Get ready to wait an hour for a bartender to look and you and ignore you some more. The extra back bar doesn't have that much so they're no help. Get bartenders who effing move it and problem solved. Heck have shot girls/guys walking around or something! I'm at a bar! I'm social awkward! Give me booze fast!!!
4177	1	a	If places like this were around right when I turned 21, I would be a regular. As a working parent, I don't get out as often but this place is a little slice of home. It's got all kinds of games, and plenty of space to socialize with friends. The selection of games here is absolutely awesome and they're free to play, so that's cool. This is a wonderful concept and I hope more people give this place a shot. It's a gamer/geek bar, so don't expect the best food or drinks, but what they have is good. All these people giving it one or two stars are being way too nit picky. Come here for the games, stay for the good times with friends. You definitely won't regret it.
4178	0	a	Update: I went back. It seems like prices have gone up and portions (drinks and food) have gone down. Menu options have been removed and it basically just serves fried bar food now. Drink menu expanded but since they take half an hour to get (which was ALMOST as long as the food toook) it's not really worth it. The first time I went they were short staffed now it looks like a skeleton crew on a busy night not okay. Staff was rude when I asked about why my order was taking so long. Will not be going back for food or drinks but I will probably go play games because that part is free. I would spend mmoney there if they made it worth it but they really dont.
4179	0	a	Great environment. Almost impossible to get to a game unless you're there from open to close. Drinks are creative but too expensive. (Understandably with free gaming) foods inexpensive but it takes forever to be made; much like the drinks. I love the staff, except the cook. Thanks to the cook last night, I'd eaten two undercooked near raw chicken tenders before my girlfriend pointed it out. The waitress was kind enough to refund and replace my food, but the food poison I had all night while I was up all night vomiting....has left me not wanting to go back. Replace the cook or get a couple of them. Either way, giving your guests food poisoning after they drop over 200 dollars at your bar is a bad way to keep business.
4180	0	a	they have good craft beers on tap. that is literally all they have going for them. it was hardly busy, and it took the bartender nearly 10 minutes just to look at us. the whole concept is great, but this place is disorganized, and the staff are unprofessional and inhospitable. will not return.
4181	1	a	Jason, aka Big J, has been my organization's DJ of choice for several years. He spins for our fundraiser and for special events during the holidays. Our guests always enjoy the music. He keeps the energy going and tailors the music to our diverse crowd. I've so appreciated his work, and how easy it is to work with him. Even my staff comment on how much fun they have with him as our DJ. Looking forward to more events with him soon! I highly recommend!
4182	1	a	I'm a realtor and my client bought a property and didn't receive the key. I called this company and they showed up right away, opened it up and rekeyed the lock. 5 stars!
4183	1	a	Great job! Very fast! They helped me out when I was in a bind. I gave them a call at 830 and had my keys in an hour.
4184	0	a	"Not exactly why this place needed a new Yelp page but anyways I am transferring my review from the other page so that people are aware of what to expect from this business...\n\nMy fianc\u00e9e and I had perviously purchased a mattress here and got a decent deal, so we knew what we were in for upon deciding to return toady. That being said, they are worse than dirty used car salesmen when it comes to being pushy. However, today was an exceptionally awful experience. We went in to look for a cheap mattress to stick in our guest bedroom. We were soon greeted by Todd and the sales pressure began. After listening to him ramble on for what seemed like days, he took a break to let us mull over his mass amounts of nonsense and went back to the sales desk for a minute. We decided that we weren't interested in any of the mattresses that they had and made our way to the door. As soon as Todd saw that we were headed out of the store he first yelled, \""MAM!\"", which we ignored and continued to walk towards our car. He then proceeded to literally chase us out of the store while we made our way to the vehicle.  We continued to ignore and (thankfully) made it to our car in time to avoid him. For a second I thought that he was going to come and knock on our car window because we didn't want to buy a damn mattress. LOL\n\nYou've got to be kidding me\n\nWe are never coming back"
4185	0	a	I just purchased over $3,000 worth of furniture from this place. My complaint is not with the furniture, but with the extremely incompetent people and generally shady-ness of the store. Of course, they promise you the moon to get you to make a purchase, then fall short of delivering on any of those promises. Ordered a bedroom set and mattress the Monday before Thanksgiving. I was told the mattress would be delivered on Friday. I just barely received the mattress 10 days later. I am still waiting on my bed frame. Almost sent ALL the furniture back due to crappy customer service and being lied to several times. But the manager called me today to set up delivery time. He told me previously that they would wave the delivery charge for all the hassle. Today he pretends like he has no idea what I'm talking about. Please, steer completely clear of this place! I will be call the BBB as well.
4186	0	a	We ordered 3 bedroom sets and 2 mattresses from this place.  We were told we would have our furniture within 7-10 days. The delivery guys have been here 3 separate times now, to drop off random pieces.  The first time they came, they brought the wrong sized beds.  Now, almost 3 months after we bought our furniture, we are STILL waiting on a dresser.  90 days is a far cry from 7-10 days.  \nBUYER BEWARE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
4187	0	a	Ordered furniture on 12/15/14 for my wife on Christmas. They said that 90% they could get it by Christmas. It's 01/02/15 and I still don't have my furniture. They also tell you they will deliver at a certain time and it doesn't happen. I have many family members who buy furniture and will not be recommending this place to anyone. I understand they couldn't get it buy Christmas but it's almost been a month since I ordered the furniture. There is a reason why people go to the big furniture stores, it's because for the most part they can deliver on there promises. This store did deliver on one of there things, THAT WOULD BE THERE WORSE REVIEWS!
4188	1	a	HIGHLY RECOMMEND: Best vegan tamales ever!! Actually everything is good!! Everything is homemade and the owners are super nice!! First tried them out at the farmers market at Tivoli Village on Saturdays then realized they are right behind my house!! Super convenient and did I mention delicious?!?!
4189	0	a	"Brand new store.  Just opened.  It's Microsoft's answer to the Apple Store.  However, I didn't notice anything resembling a \""Genius Bar\"" (though the place was so crowded I could have missed it).\n\nBasically just lots of Microsoft products for sale.  You could get them all at Amazon easier, and probably cheaper.  Without a service bar of some sort I don't really see the point.  I was able to see a Surface Type Cover on my smartphone for 25% less than they had in this store (and, in fact, I ordered one...saved $30 compared to this store).\n\nIf they have a service bar then add one star.  Otherwise, just go to Amazon and order what you want."
4190	0	a	Went here thinking I'd check out the new Microsoft store. What a colossal waste of time. Everything in here is available in any Best Buy or Fry's Electronics store. Why does this store even need to exist? I Walked through the store and was completely ignored by all the employees there - seems like their brains had blue-screened and their personalities won't be activated till the next service pack. The XBox seemed to be the most advertised item as I saw it everywhere. Funny that the XBOX posters proudly announce that it's bundled with Assassin's Creed Unity - a game with more freaking bugs than Lindsay Lohan's crotch. Hell - even the usual mallrats that seem to overwhelm Apple stores stay away from this place. 50 SHADES OF FAIL!
4191	1	a	It truly is a beautiful park between the green and the mountain. However, being yelled at from across the way with my dog off the leash would've been much better had she handled the situation by coming up to us and saying that dog needed to be on a leash full-time rather than talking on the phone. Other than that, it's a great place. It's a minor strike because I would come back again but I won't because I want my dog running without a leash.
4192	0	a	Absolutely AWFUL Service!!! Good luck getting an appointment!!! I got a groupon for a massage a couple of months ago. Over the past couple of months, I have called this business at least 4 times and left voice mails and sent 2 emails to schedule an appointment. Nobody responded. When I sent an email confirming that I would report them to groupon and the BBB if they did not contact me within 48 hours, I finally was able to make contact. She suggested Sunday Nov 2nd but I told her I was going to be at the Dunes that weekend and we agreed on October 26th. I turned up for the appointment. I was 10 minutes early. Nobody was there. I waited 25 minutes, she did not turn up. There was another lady who was also waiting for a 12pm appointment and said she too has had problems with this business in the past. I cannot be responsible for the fact that Jeanette, the owner is not able to schedule appointments competently. I have spent so much time and effort trying to get a massage. I don't want to waste any more time chasing and don't feel this business is worthy of my money. I can only imagine receiving a malicious, harsh massage because of my persistence.
4193	0	a	This place is awful.  I bought a package for massages which they have refused to honor and refuse to refund my money.  They either double book, don't show up or show up late.  Do not go here.
4194	1	a	"It's been quite a while since I've been pleasantly surprised by the simple quality of the food provided by such a random little restaurant. I have to admit my expectations were pretty low when I decided to give Fresh a try. I figured it would just be another spot that served \""healthier\"" meals; meaning smaller portions at higher prices. Yes, the prices are a little high. But the payoff is a fantastic little panini or wrap, made with higher quality ingredients, that kept me satisfied for hours.\n\nIf you're looking for a bite to eat before an event at the stadium or arena, Fresh is a fantastic alternative in the vast array of traditional fast-food and full-service restaurants that make up Westgate."
4195	1	a	Dragged in here by my healthfood crazy girlfriend. I was looking forward to a nice thick steak or a rack of ribs at Westgate before a movie. She got really excited when we passed it so i reluctantly agreed to eat here. You know what? Not half bad! I had a Mediterranean panini that was pretty tasty. We'll come back,I'm sure of it. Still woulda liked my med rare new York strip...
4196	1	a	"Dear Linger Longer Lounge - I love the atmosphere & the concept. I have often frequented the Vig on 16th & Vig Fillmore where I am trusted as a repeat patron & fairly vigorous tipper.\n\nThen you present me with a new concept - \""Linger Longer\""... \""A neighborhood comfort zone where you always have a friend\""... But there is a hitch - you don't trust me to pay my tab? Is Linger Longer a faceless club or a neighborhood comfort zone?\n\nPlease pick - faceless club or comfort zone... Comfort zones don't make you hand over credit cards (not run a credit card, but hand it over)...\n\nSo here is my guess - the neighborhood approved a comfort zone & you opened a club..."
4197	1	a	Cool, new bar in Central Phoenix.  We stopped in last week to enjoy happy hour - $3 wine, beer and bar eats...what a deal!  This place has a great atmosphere and I love the game room too...we'll definitely be back to have some fun.
4198	1	a	Usually every starbucks I have been to has pretty great costumer service, I was so excited about this starbucks opening up since is right in between my work and home. Well I have got to say that this is by far the best Starbucks I have been to, costumer service completely blows my mind here and I love how helpful they are. There is one guy who explained to me the iced coffees and a lot about one of the machines and I was in heaven learning about all of this! For sure one of my favorite spots!
4199	1	a	I am a big fan of this drive thru. It is the fastest in town!!  The service is top notch and the people are always happy and fun. Obviously management is very good. Not saying other Starbucks aren't good too, I just am in favor of this location.
4200	0	a	"Stopped by to have a drink with friends on the patio to watch the ice skaters. We had a couple local drafts and \""cranberry mimosas\"". Drinks were ok, but the girl hanging holiday lights around us was kinda rude. She even asked some people to move from their table so she could string up a row. Didn't even say excuse me when bumping a few other patrons. Could've found a better time to do this instead of a busy dinner hour."
4201	1	a	I stopped in the Corner with a friend while walking around and watching the ice skating. The Corner is a great fun place in CityScape. It's next to the ice skating so I'd recommend you check this place out when you need a break.
4202	1	a	"If someone would prepare vegetarian meals like this for me every day, I would never eat meat again! I ordered the falafel appetizer, classic burger and we all split a bottle of wine. Everything was delicious, the burger was a \""real\"" burger portion size and I chose the beet salad side. My friends ordered the living bagel (amazing) and faux tuna sandwich (wonderful.) Such delicious little place!"
4203	0	a	Looks great- like a page out of a loft kitchen in Dwell magazine- but often what looks good may not work for the intended function. As a restaurant, the space was not utilized well- a tiny waiting bench area, a bar counter that takes up more space than it offers in function, a small lounge of two chairs and a sofa that- I guess? is for waiting, that could host tables where customers could eat. It makes for a chaotic entryway where people stand or sit around in confusion.\nThe cold, stylish lines of the renovated-warehouse-chic dining area are not kind to sound: one can't hear their friends across the table because of the clatter of commerce and other customers. The result, you both have to speak louder. Then that bounces around, and everyone has to speak louder- and so it goes. It could be fixed with sound dampeners on the ceiling or walls, which could easily be integrated into the look. It's restaurant 101, really.\nThe food. No complaints, really. I didn't enjoy my lunasagna, but that is more of a personal aversion to limp zucchini, and the red sauce of the sundries tomato base was too strong somehow and didn't blend well with the nut cheese on top. I wasn't alone there, one of my group had the same opinion and couldn't finish his.\nThe bill of my group was much higher than I'd expect, and I wonder if when the hipness wears off people will realize they can make the small portions of raw food at home much cheaper, and in a quiet setting.
4204	1	a	This was my first event as a Yelp Elite and it was absolutely wonderful! The winery itself was gorgeous. I actually had never heard of it before the event, but now I'm so happy I know about it. I definitely plan on bringing friends and family back. Mingling with everyone was so much fun, and the cheese and breads were wonderful. Having Gaucho there was especially exciting! Thank you so much Rachel for planning such a fabulous event!
4205	1	a	"What a great first \""elite\"" event! Rachel was nice enough to invite me although my elite status isn't official quite yet and what a wonderful event to share with all you eliters! I was so excited to have a reason to try a new winery and this place was not short of my expectations. The red lit building gives away the edgy, cool look as soon as you set eyes on it and the interior mimics the red abstract theme from the top floor to bottom! The ambiance is amazing: wine barrels line the bottom floor, the red walls give warmth and a fun vibe and the art is awesome! The wines were dry and I usually enjoy sweet wines, but they were nice to sample! My favorite was the \""Malbec\"", which had a spicy zing to it, but was not overwhelming. I really thought that it was the perfect blend! The Merlot, Petite Sirah and Red Blend were pretty dry. I'm not a wine connoisseur but I really couldn't taste the difference between the three, though for being dry wines, they were smooth. The sauvignon Blanc was good, though I couldn't taste the citrus undertones. I did miss decorating a wine glass, which would have been awesome, as well as the raffle for a bottle of wine, but we did arrive about 45 minutes late, so it is good to arrive early to these events, or so I've learned! Friends urged us to try the Gaucho Parrilla Argentina food and it was awesome. The staff was very helpful and nice and served us even though there was 10 minutes left to go of the event. After reviewing their website, I've come to the conclusion that I tried the Rosemary Braised Beef: \""Horsey sauce and caramelized onion\"" and I believe the Chanchito: \""pork tenderloin, pickled onion, mushroom and arugula.\"" The Rosemary Braised Beef was pretty good. The horse radish flavor was subtle but you definitely tasted it every bite. The Chanchito was my favorite. The flavors complimented each other and was a unique way to dress up pork! I cannot wait to try more food from Gaucho! This event mixed together people, wine, food, and art and made an amazing night out of another free Yelper event! Another thanks to Rachel!"
4206	1	a	I had never been to Pittsburgh Winery before, but they have a beautiful venue. And every wine I tried was very good, even if they weren't all my favorite. The guys at the bar were very patient and attentive as we made our decisions. \n\nThe vendors were all so nice. I am now a big fan of Wheel & Wedge and Great Harvest. Wheel & Wedge made some brilliant pairing choices, my favorite being the Tomme Delicious with the Merlot. I had no idea I loved merlot, but I know now! I ended up buying both the cheese and the wine. The people from Great Harvest were so cute, it was their first event and they didn't think to bring anything to sell, and everyone was asking them about it. They seemed very grateful to be there and were mildly surprised at how interested everyone was in their company. Their bread was fantastic, I tried the kind with the plethora of seeds, and it was hearty and delicious. Nice people, I'll definitely look them up. And Gaucho Parrilla is now on my to do list. Those guys know how to have a good time. Lol. I loved the braised beef with the horseradish sauce, caramelized onions, and mushrooms. It was heavenly. \n\nI'm not great at socializing, and we didn't feel like doing any wine glass painting, but my +1 and I had a blast anyways. It was a great atmosphere and Rachel C. really knows how to throw a party. Can't wait to see what's next!
4207	1	a	After last night, I've decided to quit the day job I've enjoyed for nearly a decade and move onto my heart's real passion - painting wine glasses and eating bread.  \n\nAs far as ambiance, it doesn't get much better than Pittsburgh Winery.  I'm a sucker for a blood red wall, and they have them in spades.  Flanked by wine barrels and caf\u00e9 tables, they really do have a great space that I could see expanding beyond events and into a regular restaurant establishment.  Not only was the setting lovely, but the vendors were perfect.  Great Harvest - I love you and I can't wait to buy a big loaf of orange/cranberry bread and eat it until I bust.  Thanks also to The Wedge & Wheel and Gaucho for their fare and the fabulous Rachel C. for another INCREDIBLE event (and the pretty new wine glasses)!
4208	1	a	Yay! This was my first Yelp Elite event. My guest and I had a great time sampling the succulent appetizers from Gaucho, tantalizing cheeses from Wheel & Wedge, and hearty bread from Great Harvest Bread Company. Pittsburgh Winery was a great choice for the event as their wine was a great accompaniment to the wonderful flavors of the food. My date and I also enjoyed decorating wine glasses that will serve as decoration at my upcoming house party next week. I look forward to attending future Yelp Elite events and meeting others that have a passion for good food, both here in Pittsburgh and beyond.\n\nThank you, Rachel, for hosting a fun event.
4209	1	a	I am so happy to be a part of the yelp community !! Gaucho's chef made an awesome speech during this event where he praised us yelpers for promoting local businesses, although that is exactly what we do I never really thought of it in that perspective! Made me feel so proud to be a yelper! Shout out to Aj S. For encouraging me to start yelping!! \n\nThis event was awesome!! I've never been to pittsburgh winery and was so excited to check it out!! What an awesome place! From the front door, to the stairs to the cellar, the vibe is relaxing and unique! The red lightning was so different and made me feel like I was in a speak easy almost! Such an awesome set up- can't wait to bring my wine-o friends and family to check it out! \n\nNow on to the wine. Honestly my taste buds haven't matured to the level of wines they had, I'm more of a matured beer drinker than I am wine. But that doesn't mean I didn't enjoy it! I tried them all. As far as reds go I leaned toward the red blend but the Sauvignon blanc was my fav! I bought a bottle - the bartenders encouraged me to have as much as I wanted to there and then they would recork it for me when leaving! How awesome? They were also super knowledgable of the wines and encouraged me and my guest to try them all! \n\nThe cheese from wheel and wedge were very unique and pretty good- although I am not the biggest fan of cheese , it was fun trying new kinds that I haven't tried before. \n\nI loved great harvest bread company! The cranberry orange was my favorite- soft and packed with oranges and cranberries, so yummy and perfect for the holidays! \n\nGaucho was the favorite of the evening! I've been meaning to go there forever so I was super excited to sample some of their dishes! The chef was so friendly and had such an awesome personality. The roasted pork with arugula, crimini mushrooms and picked onions was my favorite! So tasty and the pork was so juicy and flavorful! The shrimp and rice dish was awesome too! I loved the beef horseradish dish too, super good! Can't wait to go there! \n\nAwesome event!! I had such a great time! Thanks Rachel C! can't wait for the next one!
4210	1	a	Rachel thank you so much for another fantastic yelp event! It was AMAZEBALLS! The wine was delicious, the food was fantastic. I can't say enough good things about this event. I was kinda bummed that I didn't get to paint a wine glass but I've got enough wine glasses for a small army and certainly didn't need another. The wine is very good, I'm so excited that the Pittsburgh winery is finding their footing! We stopped In a few months ago to sample some wines and check out the event space. For anyone who is looking to plan an event, this space is fantastic. All the red and the wine vats make it very cozy and welcoming. Plus I love that they have a small stage for live music! A wonderful night! Thanks again!
4211	1	a	What a fun event!  I brought my husband along as we are both fans of the Pittsburgh Winery.  We didn't do much sampling, we both tried the petite syrah and the red blend and then bought a glass of each.\n\nWe thought Gaucho stole the show as far as the vendors went--although the food from everywhere was great!  We are glad to have a Great Harvest in Pittsburgh, as we were big fans of the one in Omaha.  Wheel and Wedge had some interesting cheese offerings and we will be checking out their Public Market space the next time we are there.
4212	1	a	"Lovely, lovely venue!  The Pittsburgh Winery is flat out beautiful.  The d\u00e9cor is so swanky from the colors to the lights to the wine barrels that line the walls.  Completely loved the atmosphere, so knowing when we arrived that this is where we would be spending the Un-Wine and Relax event I felt pretty darn excited to be there!\n\nOnce underway, Yelpers made their rounds to the three vendors: Wheel and Wedge that offered up a variety of cheeses, several breads from Great Harvest Bread, and a trio of samples from Gaucho Parilla Argentina.  Let's not forget the star of the event the wine sampling by the Pittsburgh Winery.  We decided to start there.  I sampled about two then decided it would be best just to buy a bottle.  We decided on the Red Blend which boasts California grapes. This was a good choice, but it was a bit on the pricy side.  Afterwards we made our way over to the Wheel and Wedge to sample a bite of cheese.  Very tasty!  I love cheese.  We didn't get to try the Great Harvest's bread selections, but instead headed back to our table to do some socializing, one of the many reasons I love Yelp Elite Events!  \n\nAt the tables there were wine glasses available for decorating.  I opted out of this, not because it didn't look fun, no it falls more into the category of \""I draw worse than a kindergartener.\""  So once the line settled down at Gaucho we went over to try some of their offerings as well.  My favorite was the pork dish whereas the hubs liked the horseradish beef dish.  They were good and I had an interesting talk with the one worker from Gaucho.  I also really enjoyed that everyone involved in the evening stood on stage to tell you more about their businesses.  \n\nAnother great Yelp event, thanks again Rachel C for organizing and delivering a fun filled time, all the vendors and their generous offerings and of course the Pittsburgh Winery!  See you at the next one!"
4213	1	a	Nice to have a new interesting restaurant nearby. Great relaxed atmosphere. Still working out some kinks. Highlights included the tuna carpaccio, the beef tartare and the arugula salad. Need to expand the wines by the glass offerings. Looking forward to another visit soon as they get more things worked out.

Every bit the trendy spot, but comfortable with several seating options and a soundtrack ranging from Taylor Swift to The Doors, the experience at Hearthstone begins with vibe and featuring a staff already exceedingly well trained and exuberant in their discussion of the food and drink the large menu is the sort that could just as easily seen in Chicago, Los Angeles, or even New York - a wide selection of shared plates, snacks, cheese, and charcuterie alongside a few 'entrees' and desserts.  \n\nSeated at a raised leather booth, overlooking the kitchen where Massie and his team worked non-stop in front of wood burning ovens turning out pie after pie, it was in a selection of housemade charcuteries, spreads, and bread from Bon Breads that the meal began and with both the rillette and ricotta truly standout alongside truffled honey as well as reduced balsamic cream the \""FGJ\"" only found its footing after being allowed fifteen minutes to warm up, the texture then smooth enough to spread athough the accompanying brioche had long since cooled down.  Sipping the well balanced and whimsical \""Honey Badger\"" as I awaited round two, it would not be long before a flatbread and two sides arrived and with a well blistered crust bolstering the flavor profile of cracked pepper, onions, and pork beneath an egg added tableside the only thing that prevented me from devouring the whole \""Carbonara\"" immediately was the quality of the sides, a creamy low-bowl of polenta teaming with butter poached lobster while the squash was a perfect taste of autumn - a substantial plate for $7 and perhaps the best bites of the night.  \n\nAt this point quite sated it was an unexpected surprise that the team opted to send out a few more items to try and although I cannot say the tuna did much for me as I generally find the fish to be quite boring, the scallop tartare was absolutely silken in texture with a bold hit of acid up front and light heat on the finish.  Rounding out the savories with a salad far more interesting than I'd have guessed and charred octopus no less fabulous than that at Carnevino atop an admixture of brine and smoke it was onward to dessert that the meal progressed and although the apple tart was already sold out the highly recommended pudding and seemingly overplayed 'lava cake' both showed strongly, neither exceedingly sweet and the cake especially remarkable when the crowd-pleasing center poured forth with a flavor of pure roasted peanuts and bananas rather than some sugary concoction that could have unbalanced the whole plate.\n\nDeclined any form of a check and thus presenting an uncomfortable situation where I emptied the limited cash in my wallet in order to compensate the stellar service I'd originally considered reserving my opinions for a second visit, but evaluating the cuisine and experience as objectively as I can I'll simply say that Hearthstone has the potential to be very special, particularly given its location.  As yet still finding its footing and offering a menu that seems a bit 'everything to everyone' it will be very interesting to see how Light Group tries to bring locals out to Red Rock for such a large and aggressive concept, but with plans for daily specials and prices trending far lower than similar spots on the strip I'd suggest that the average couple could easily compose a great meal here for less than $100 by focusing on small plates and come away very happy, the well-culled charcuterie selection and a cocktail also presenting an option for those looking for an after-work hangout or a light bite before a night out."
4215	0	a	What has happened to Summerlin?! And thank you hearthstone for following suit to terrible service and false expectations. Overbooking mutiple tables on reservations and the food has to be something amazing to make up for this. Always excuses and everything left to the imagination because someone with a reservation 30 minutes after us walks in way before us.
4216	0	a	What happened to quality in Summerlin?! We spend 1000's a month on dining out and this is what you start us off with? 730 reservation only to watch someone at 8pm with a 8pm reservation name drop the Firtittas and get right in? So bad that I had to say that I personally trained the Firtittas and Satinis and voila we got right in. This food had better be amazing to make up for this and Elgin is one amazing server to take the brunt of this experience and still make us want to come back. He should be promoted.
4217	0	a	This place is a waste of time and money. Literally they wasted 3 hours of our night. Thank goodness we made up for it with friendly conversation with ourselves. \nThe portions the five for the sharing plates and flatbreads are enough for one, however for 28 dollars you would think the Waygu Beef short ribs would be bigger than two measly squared pieces. The flavor and texture was good, but when I spend that much I want more than 4 oz of meat. The pasta dish was I'd guess a half cup for 24. Again not worth it. The biggest problem was the way they handle business. They told us they could get us right in on a Saturday night but needed to bus the table. It took 20 minutes to bus the table. After 8 of us were done eating, they finally brought out our entrees (beef and pasta) for those who ordered it; we felt the need to share our discontent with the server who then got the manager. Rather than the manager being cordial he was a straight up pompous douche. He spent 20 minutes giving us excuses as to why they took 3 hours and how it is standard operating procedure. \nDo not go here. Nothing would make me happier than to see something else in its place the next time I am at the Red Rock.
4218	1	a	First impression was breathtaking. This place is absolutely beautiful. With the low reviews we still wanted to give it a shot. To start things off our waitress told us she didn't know that ham was pork lol & wasn't sure if the beef short rib meat balls were pork or beef. . Reviews read that portions are on the small side & priced a bit high.  I think it's true, but well executed. Only downfall was we found a huge chunk of white plastic in our mushroom pizza.. Didn't stop me from finishing it though. The situation was handled professionally and we were offered dessert and the pizza was on the house. Overall a great edition to the city and I'm 99% sure will be back.
4219	0	a	Ate a $19 flatbread pizza and was starving after I ate it all. Nice ambiance, bit I was hungry. My suggestion is to take a pass on this restaurant.
4220	1	a	Good food good drinks! \n\nMeatballs are a must have. Beef tartar was really good too. Chorizo stuffed dates, yes plz! \n\nTried the salmon entree and it was delicious. My girlfriend got the beet salad and she loved it. Staff was super friendly and service was good. Def coming back.
4221	0	a	"Arrived to Hearthstone Kitchen & Cellar at about 5:30pm. The hostess asked if we had a reservation and when we said no they quickly said that they were \""fully committed,\"" but could put us on a waiting list. We were completely fine with the wait until we started looking around and there were A TON of open tables. After asking about the open tables the girls repeated that they were \""fully committed,\"" and we could not be seated at any of the open tables. Disappointed, we decided to go eat at one of the nearby restaurants. Our car was parked in the Red Rock parking lot so we walked back through Hearthstone and (not to our surprise) they STILL had a bunch of tables opened. \n\nKnowing the restaurant business turning away business is always a bad thing to do. I give Hearthstone 2 stars because the decor was right up my alley. Maybe one day I will be lucky enough to get a table and be able to update my review. As for now I would rather stick to my favorite restaurants."

4223	0	a	"Went here for a business dinner this week.  \n\nThe look of the restaurant is trendy and okay but in no way inviting for an extended meal.  Tables for a party of more than four are high-tops with exceedingly uncomfortable bar chairs.  One of our party has had knee replacement and couldn't have her leg hanging from the stool/chair for and extended time.  We asked for one of the lobby stools to be brought over for her to rest her foot on; the wait staff was unable to accommodate this and told us it would have to be a manager (the manager never showed) but the wait staff kept coming by to find out if the manager had satisfied our request (we were there nearly 3 hours it never happened).\n\nEverything in the restaurant is hard surfaces which leads to a very LOUD room, the only saving grace to this was the staff didn't increase the volume of the music with the volume of the patrons.  As it was it was so loud you could only hear the person immediately next to you, forget about having a cohesive group conversation with the 7 people we had there for dinner.  The wait staff is done \""team style\"" which is good in theory but leads to a lot of disconnect between what we asking for versus what we were being given.\n\nRegarding the food:\nIts billed as rustic American cuisine; however, its very French and Italian - sorry but this gave me a chuckle as I was reviewing the menu.  \nCocktails -  \nMojito - she returned it as undrinkable\nRed Sangria - she said it was alright but rather weak in flavor.\nBottle of red wine - unsure of what it was but the others started doing internet searches on its value and rating which led me to believe they weren't overly impressed with it.\nAppetizers - \nAbe Froman flatbread - was told that it was good but way to heavy with fennel for my taste.\nCarbonara  Flatbread - was alright, I've had better.\nRoasted Artichokes with Black Truffle Yogurt - this was pretty tasty and we all seemed to enjoy it.\nDinner - We had several with duplicate food orderings.\nRotisseri Chicken & Roasted Fingerling Potatoes with Jalapenos  and Roast \nBroccoli- Chicken was okay, moist not dried out, could have done without the charred thyme stalks. Potatoes were tasty but randomly seasoned.  Was told that the broccoli was not worth ordering again.\nWagyu Burger Special - he said it was good but only ate half of it so I was left wondering.\nWagyu Short Ribs - he seemed to be satisfied with his.\nPesto Shrimp Pasta - was told it was good but she felt over priced.\nDesert - \nPeanut Butter Lava Cake - everyone said this was good but they couldn't have more than a couple of bites.\nApple Tart - was very good according to all.\nBlood Orange Sorbet - was really looking forward to this and sorely disappointed, tasted like it was made with Tang and red food coloring.\n\nAll in all I'm glad someone was able to put this on their expense account.  I don't see that any of us that live here will be returning for another meal."
4224	1	a	Delish! A big thank you to the GM for making room for us at the bar in front of the pizza ovens. We came by on a Saturday night without a reservation and it was packed. Every seat was filled, including in the bar/lounge area.\n\nService was a little choppy. Everyone we interacted with was pleasant, but sometimes few and far between. Management was great. The food was delicious:\n\n-Deviled eggs\n-Baked ricotta (MY FAV!)\n-Pepperoni flatbread\n\nWe also had some cocktails, champagne and a moscow mule-type of cocktail. The baked ricotta was my favorite! It came with crusty bread slices and a little pot of honey. The perfect starter.\n\nEnd result, I will definitely return!
4225	1	a	So my boyfriend and I came here this evening, thought we would try something new and off the strip. \nFirst of all, the atmosphere is very hipster/ NYC ish. Love it! \nWe got a charcuterie board with salami, pepperoni and pecorino cheese with stone ground mustard and truffle honey. I could have eaten the honey by itself with a straw but I didn't wanna be that weird person lol\n\nThe baked ricotta was hands down the best thing we tried. It came in a deep dish and was still warm from the oven. Again with truffle honey\n\nShort Rib Meatballs were delicious and paired very well with the goat cheese underneath.\n\nThe DOC pizza was the only thing I didn't care for. It was  good, but lacking flavor. Crust was very thin and flimsy. Buffalo mozzarella needed some salt to set off the flavor. The pizza itself didn't have much sauce either. But I ate it because I love pizza and I refuse to send food back.\n\nThe Wagyu Short Rib Burger was delicious. Perfect portion and had a side of fries. Fries were GF free too!  \n\n\nService was fantastic! Ryan A was our server, did a menu walk thru and gave recommendations. If you come in, sit in his section, he was very knowledgable ! \n\n\nAt the end of our meal we decided that we would rather drive all the way up from deep henderson to eat here than deal with the hustle and bustle of the strip. \nAmazing find!
4226	0	a	I went to Hearthstone last night with my family for my birthday. Food was good, service was absolutely off point. First off we started with one server and then 29 minutes later had another server. Second round of drinks took three times asking about them and 40 minutes to actually get. Manager did come to table and apologize and took care of those for us. That's fine. Good recovery. Hoped things would get better. They did not. We ordered the roasted potatoes, we asked about them a few times and never got them. Ended up asking them to be removed from our bill. The wrong flat bread was brought to us because our waitress pressed the wrong button. Then the Bronzino we ordered with our entrees to share was also never received because it was never written down when we ordered it. It was a mess. Which is really sad because the food was pretty damn good! Apart from the jalape\u00f1o hummus. This was bland. There was no jalape\u00f1o flavor and needed salt. The wood fire clams were very good, but are served in an amazing broth and no bread to sop it up with. I did ask for bread because it was a very tasty broth. Plus the items are shared so you can't really pass the bowl around to eat with a spoon. We had a lot of other items that were all good. Drinks were very good, however I got the Pimm's 50 first and then the blackberry drink and then another Pimm's 50 which didn't look like the first one I got, so there was some inconsistency there. \n I know this isn't the most eloquent review but I just want Hearthstone to know that the restaurant is beautiful inside. The menu is lovely and the food is very good for the most part. What ruined it for myself and my family was the service and all the mistakes made last night. We didn't even stay to look at or get dessert, and I'm a pastry chef, I love to check out other desserts and menus. We just wanted our of there. Will I go back? Yeah, sure, not anytime soon though. This place needs to get their service in order first. Which is really unfortunate because the food is worth coming back for.
4227	1	a	I was greeted immediately by very friendly hostess. The staff looks amazing and seems to carry themselves very well. My server was very informed on the menu and had some amazing recommendations. The baked ricotta with drizzled honey was fantastic and definitely my personal favorite, after the PBJ foie-gras. This is a new restaurant and I believe an excellent addition to Red Rock Casino and the Summerlin community. The great food and service definitely made my night enjoyable. Will definitely recommend and be back again
4228	0	a	"Huge disappointment! When we first walked in to the restaurant I had a really good vibe. Friendly hostess at the front and really nice decor. Our reservations were at 630pm and the rest of our party got there around 645. I'm hoping our main server was new because she seemed afraid to talk and was very unorganized. The second server that was helping was very confident and friendly. \nMy husband and I ordered the pizza special which was duck and prosciutto pizza, the wagyu short rib burger, the meat and cheese platter and the jalapeno hummus. We were a table of 12 so when everyone's food started to come out at different times at first it was understandable. About 30 mins into the meal glasses were empty and sat empty for a while. No water or alcohol to help ease the pain of waiting over 2 hours for our main course. One of our friends dishes was completely forgotten, our burger was not ordered and another friends cheese dish was not brought out (they only gave him bread, no cheese).  To add to the unorganized mess, our $21.00 yes I said $21.00 wagyu short rib burger was a total waste of money. They did a really good job making the exact replica of  the animal sauce at inn n out burger and it was overcooked. I would rather pay half the price for a black truffle cheeseburger a couple doors down at the yard house. The duck prosciutto pizza which was $19.00 had a few little pieces of duck that you could barely see/taste and a little tiny slice of prosciutto on each slice of pizza. Again not worth it. \nTo end the 3 hour long dinner the male server asks how things were and I told him it was OK. I normally don't like to complain but he asked me for my \""honest opinion\"" twice more (I guess because he saw we only took a few bites of our $21 burger and not even trying the fries) so I told him in a nice way what I thought. Mentioning everything from the forgotten dishes to the 2 hour wait for our main course and the ridiculously priced burgers.  He tells us \""oh yes I heard about the forgotten dishes and the two our wait for food\"" and apologized to our table offering a couple of free desserts. We kindly declined because at this point we didn't want to wait another hour for our dessert to arrive. When we received our bill the only thing that was taken off was one of the forgotten dishes. No manager came over to speak with us or anything. There are more negative things to add to this review but it is long enough already. I had really high hopes for this restaurant but will never be going back to this place."
4229	0	a	Went here with high expectations. Sat at a really cool bar counter right in front of the stove ovens. Great ambience. Really gorgeous restaurant. First we ordered oysters... Delicious! Then we\nOrdered the fp & j  (foie with pnut &jelly) and a charcuterie board. Thought it was a little tacky you had to pay extra for bread/ honey to come with your meat and cheese board, I have never seen this before but it was only 1$ so hey, whatever.. So we added on truffle honey and bread and purchased a bottle of wine all at the same time. \nThe food was fabulous! Cheese was perfect temp. Foie was so yummy. But no bread...we were Sat right next to the kitchens expo so I felt guilty bothering here but had to inquire about bread a few times, 10 min later our server shows up with 4 tiny pieces if bread. I ordered more right away. We had cheese, foie and rillette all requiring bread. 10 minutes later our bread order came, I ordered another right away. \nKeep in mind we never got our bottle of wine. After the 3rd round of bread we cancelled the wine and told the server politely that we paid 15$ in bread and have waited over half an hour for wine and we weren't even able to finish our charcuterie board. She sent a Manager and they offered complimentary apps and we're really nice and apologetic but by that time we were over it. They comped our charcuteriebut our Bill was still about 100$ for the foi, some oysters and a glass of bubbles. \nWe most likely won't return. Any place that charges for bread that takes 10 min to get to your table and wine that takes 30+ min is not my cup of tea.

Started out with descent service and two attentive servers but after the  $90 worth of food for two people was delivered, nobody showed up to check on us until we asked for the check 35 minutes later. No time for us to sell ourselves on dessert before our movie. Guess that's why they have such a bad rating. Good luck with downtown Summerlin opening next door with 36 food options!
4231	0	a	"The food is good but the reservation process is horrible and neither management nor the hostesses really care about your patronage.  We have tried a number of times and every time just to get a table it's so painful.\n\nFirst time we had a reservation at 630 and they didn't sit us until 730 the hostesses were completely indifferent when mentioned. Worse yet when we finally did get in one hour late there are plenty of tables available.\n\nSecond time we tried to make reservation by calling ahead but it went straight to voicemail which indicated leave a message and someone will call you right back one hour later still no call back.  We arrived and mentioned this to the hostesses (both exhibiting a16 year old mentality with no clue) and basically got the \""oh duh\"", \""the phone doesn't ring to us\"" response. \""Sorry 1 hour wait\"".  Wow.  We walked in looking for a bar spot .. Found a manager asked to help us..  Told him the entire situation .. His response was he asked us to sit on a couch for dinner. Thats not dining.  No thanks.  He wasn't even concerned about the experience we just had.  We told him we were going to the competitors. He said okay thank you.\n\nThird attempt more of the same.  We spent some time talking to the hostess about our poor experience.. who said her father was a VP of such and such and that's why she got the job there. She admitted to having no experience and believe me it showed. She admitted they purposely stack reservations just to try and create a hype. Ridiculous.\n\nBottom line if you want to go somewhere where they don't care about you this is your spot considering there are dozens of other great restaurants in the area for both service and food (T Bones, Honey Salt, Echo and Rig, Wolfgang Pucks, Vinter Grill, Flemings, etc), the Light Group should really get their act together here. \n\nWe'd recommend staying away and leave it to the tourist to be forced to eat here with sub par experience."
4232	1	a	We took my wife's mom, who was visiting from Cali, for a nice dinner. That's exactly what we got. The restaurant setting was very comfortable with leather lounge sofas, bar seating, wooden tables and booths. It had a modern, yet rustic feel. Modern rustic perhaps? Great interior design. And 80s music playing in the background. Also a ton of TVs. We had 2 servers. Both were pleasant, knowledgable about the menu, and were always accessible. Excellent service. The food: we ordered a couple of shared plates...ricotta bake with honey, wild arugula salad, and lobster polenta. Oh man, the lobster polenta was so creamy. AmaZing. I also ordered the entree Rotisserie Chicken with arugula salad. It was tender and moist and had great taste. For dessert we shared the Peanut Butter scotch Lava Cake. Wow! I'm full. Good job Hearthstone. We love Red Rock and most certainly will be back for more.
4233	0	a	I was disappointed.  Service was very slow:  it took over 45 minutes for the waitress to get hummus to the table and it was over two hours before we were served our entrees.  The jalapeno hummus had no kick to it at all:  it just tasted like regular hummus, nothing special.  The chickpea salad had too much of a vinegar flavor for my taste.  The roasted chicken was OK, but the juice that was served with it was sweet instead of savory, and I didn't care for it very much.  The presentations were nice, but the flavor didn't hold up.\n\nWe were seated at a table with chairs, and after the first hour of waiting for our food, the seats were very uncomfortable.  Our table was next to a carving station where they cut up the whole suckling pigs that are an option on the menu.  While some people might enjoy watching a pig get carved up, we did not.  And the smell of the roasted pig detracted from our experience.\n\nHearthstone was loud, had poor service, and mediocre food.  We won't be back.  There are too many other great places in Las Vegas for great meals.
4234	1	a	Came on a Friday night so this place was buzzing. Great upscale ambience, spacious dining room, friendly service. Lots to choose from on the menu and prices are not crazy.\n\nMeatballs, burrata jar with truffle/honey, beet salad with goat cheese....All really amazing. Good cocktail menu, nice wine list and a great bar scene. The place had lots of tvs so I would definitely come back for a game.
4235	1	a	Stopped in with my wife, cool vibe and casual with great food. We shared octopus, tuna carpaccio, steak tar tar, crabby toast, Fb&j toast, lobster polenta and a peanut butter lava cake w butterscotch pudding and roasted banana brown butter ice cream...., yum!!
4236	1	a	This place is the craft cocktail place in Aria. Just opened and the mixologists know what they're doing :) A relaxing and fun vibe. Not pretentious and can I emphasize... Relaxed? This is a good spot on the Vegas strip.
4237	0	a	Don't bother coming here. The drinks are expensive and they charge you per ice cube. Yes they charge you for ice.
4238	0	a	The most arrogant and expensive bar I have ever been to. My friend was refused water. This is serious he is s diabetic and always needs water while having a drink. The female bartender was not friendly and to think after we ordered 2 expensive drinks would not give us water. Also, chairs were moved and we had to move one back and were given stares like we had done something really bad. Seriously, I have been to bars all over the world and this is not Monaco or San Tropez where they can have an attitude and do not.  Go to the Lift Bar bartenders are a class act and friendly and polite.
4239	1	a	Great spot right in the heart of Aria. Comfortable atmosphere, friendly staff and delicious drinks. My favorite is the Blackberry Bliss made with Gin, bomb. Definitely my go to lounge in Vegas.
4240	1	a	My favorite drink is the blackberry bliss. The feel of this place is great the staff is very knowledgable about the variety of cocktails. The venue is crisp looking and compliments Aria's modern style.
4241	0	a	Terrible service. The cocktail waitress (Theresa) could not handle the 1/4 full lounge. The place was almost empty and all the tables were reserved. The Bar manager stood in the corner with a scowl and texted on his phone the whole time.  It's one of those places that is unwelcoming and thinks it's a cooler hipper spot than it really is. The staff is too hip to take care of the customers. Drinks were weak and the over priced, of course. After ordering my rum and coke with lime, she brought it with no line and then I asked her for the lime and she still never brought it. My friend ordered a beer and she brought the bottle with no glass. Theresa should find another line of work.\n\nUPDATE:  The manager wrote a reply to this review asking for me to please email them.  Made it sound like they care and would like to follow though so I sent an email to this person, Joanna and I never got a reply.
4242	1	a	Nice..casual..great service (vegas great)..\nEast access..sweet setting..cool people. .rocking music..and off course..great looking service
4243	0	a	4stars to DJ !!! \nI got hyped by the music that DJ played for us.\nHe played songs that are mixed from old funk to pop songs.\nTransition between songs is really smooth. \n\n0 stars for the bar. Cocktails were not worth the price.\n\n(4+0)/2=2 stars
4244	0	a	"Located inside Aria, this is a fancy looking cocktail lounge with great music. I liked how everything was so nicely set up. Someone would come by every now and then to clean up your table and to reorganize things nicely as they were each time. \nThe reason why I gave them 2 stars however is because of the cocktail. I tried 2 of their signature cocktails, but I felt like they really weren't that good especially considering the price. Perhaps it was supposed to be a savory cocktail or something, but it all just tasted to funky for me. I requested for something really sweet, and that was the recommendation I got. \nIf you are looking for somewhere \""nice\"" atmosphere wise, this is the place to go to, but otherwise don't go."
4245	1	a	L O V E !!!!!!!!!! Went there and absolutely looooved the black berry bliss ! Great atmosphere and the staff was super accommodating. Tyra in particular ! She was so sweet and helpful ! I highly recommend ... The bartender was great too her skills were great I think her name was Naedene !!!! This place is great def. Recommend I'll be back in April !!!!
4246	1	a	I visited The Dancing Dog this evening, had an excellent meal, and the service was wonderful as well. The staff are very friendly, and everything on the menu (including the wine) is 100% vegan. I had the vegan fish and chips. I think the vegan fish pieces (there were three) are Sophie's Choice brand, and they are deep fried, so if you are looking for vegan health food, this might not be the dish for you. However, if you want the closest thing I've ever tasted to British-style fish and chips, this would be it. The tartar sauce was tasty and the coleslaw was some of the best I've had anywhere. For dessert, I ordered the chocolate chocolate chip, cookie, which was also excellent. Dense and chocolatey, slightly crispy on the outside and soft on the inside.\n\nI will definitely visit here again the next time I'm in Urbana. Any vegans and vegetarians in town should feel lucky to have this wonderful restaurant.
4247	1	a	I'm so glad that this place replaced Cip's. We came here the day it opened not knowing that and happened to be their first customers! I had the pineapple curry and it was A-MAZ-ING. My husband had the Pad Kee Maw (flat rice noodles) with beef and he loved it. Their spice level is 1-5 instead of 1-10, fyi. Today I went for lunch and had the ginger chicken. It was a little heavy on the oil but that's what makes it good!
4248	1	a	I drove past a few times and said to myself, wasn't that a bar a couple weeks ago? Were they really able to open it up into a restaurant that quick? Yes! And the food is amazing!!!! The staff was extremely welcoming and my pineapple chicken curry gave life! Not to mention the delicious cocktails as well! There is no doubt they will be seeing a lot of me and my husband!
4249	1	a	The service was very good. The have a bar with 3 TVs and my lychee drink was very good as were the fresh summer rolls. My noodle dish was good, but I got a 2 out of 5 on the spice level and absolutely could have handled a 3. It was good by all means though I think the flavors are a bit more bold at Thai Spoon. My husband had the pumpkin curry and again it was good through the one at Nicki's Thai Kitchen is a bit better. It was not very busy but there was a lot of take out orders. I would go again, it would be a great place to watch a game and have some Thai food but it's not the best Thai I've ever had but it certainly was good. I do prefer the food down the road at Thai Spoon, but this place has a full bar and you're not crowded against the next table like you are at Thai Spoon.
4250	1	a	"My first visit to this relatively new Thai offering.  I am so pleased to have this reasonably priced, solid menu, casual Thai restaurant in the South Hills!\nThe service is polite and friendly, as well as helpful if you are not a Thai regular.\nI had the Duck Curry.  My Son had Thai Noodle Curry. \nThe heat levels go from 1-5 and they will caution you accordingly.\nI rate my Curry at a solid 4.  My son is about the same...he asked for more heat after sampling, the wait staff was quick to remedy!\nThey have a full battery, however I had the Jasmine tea, which was a great compliment to the meal.\nI look forward to trying their weekday lunch specials which include many different curries at under $8, including salad!\n\nIf you want a casual, authentic Thai experience that won't strip your budget, I highly recommend \""My Thai\""."
4251	0	a	Do yourself a favor, drive right by this place, turn east on baseline, and drive until you get to Black Bear Diner on the south side of the street. Bad food, bad service.
4252	0	a	Worse service ever!!!!!! Don't bother with this Village Inn. The management is awful. There are too many other Village Inn's in the area to deal with the poor service. The one on Power & Ray is a better option.
4253	1	a	"Great new place in Cave Creek!  CCOOC's website boasts that they have \""the highest quality oils and balsamics from all over the world.\""  Well, I love both and have done many tastings so trust me when I say, they have a great selection of the best oils and balsamics I've tasted! Everything was so true to the label; bold and flavorful. This will be my new go-to place when I want quality o & b!"
4254	1	a	Bought some olive oil and balsamic vinegar while visiting AZ from WA and had it shipped. The postal carrier tossed it on our porch and broke the balsamic vinegar bottle. I called and Rich shipped out a new bottle free of charge right away. Customer service is incredible, and Rich was great! Thank you, we will be ordering from Cave Creek Oil Company in the future.
4255	1	a	This is a fabulous shop - I've bought several bottles from them now, and can say that truly these oils are the real deal, not over-processed, over-pressed, too-young oils; these are rich, and full-flavored, whether deliciously accented with butter, shallot, garlic etc. or pure EVO. The balsamics are every bit as good and while the flavors certainly can stand alone they combine in so many delicious ways! Rich and Martha will let you taste anything and have great suggestions on combos and cooking. Healthy, light, delicious, EASY way to add fabulous flavors to so many dishes. If you have never used a flavored balsamic or EVO I promise it will change the way you cook! Check out the honeys, candles, and ceramics while you are there too - great gift ideas! (Try the avocado lemon oil with white fish with just a light drizzle of balsamic over the top just before serving - so quick and easy, no more boring week night dinners, and you look like a pro!)
4256	1	a	Located next to 5 Guys with several young ladies who greet you with a smile and a handshake I've always liked the idea of SportClips, this new location far more appealing than others with several screens showing college football while you wait.  A bit isolated from Downtown Summerlin proper but far more convenient for parking as a result I are myself coming here often.  Good price, friendly service, and sports - no complaints from me.
4257	1	a	I went in for the MVP haircut and Kristen really took care of my nappy hair. She was friendly, not awkward, and overall made me feel welcomed in her chair. I will return!
4258	1	a	I had the oppurtunity to pop in to this new kid on the block last weekend and I can confirm it WILL be popular.  I think it may have been around 7-8pm on a Saturday so the place was packed, inside and out. \n\nFrom what I could see the seating was ample and the outdoor portion was well thought out.  The parking might become an issue but I think eventually foot traffic will be the main form of transportation to this place.\n\nThe beers.  The beers looked diverse with your typical stout, porter, IPA lineup and I had a chance to try the IPA.  It was actually pretty great.\n\nUltimately I'd like to come back on a weekday to really enjoy the place without the crowds.
4259	1	a	This place is amazing! Friendly staff, live music, awesome food trucks, and most importantly DELICIOUS BEER! I can't wait to go back!
4260	0	a	Ok let's face the cold hard truth! The area and the building themselves beautiful. The layout well thought out, food court less to be desired. With all the traffic of people it was not easy to go in and out of that area. A plus there is lots of parking and places to sit which is great. Now as for as the shopping not so good! The prices not even close to usa, but to be fair I was expecting that with the exchange and are taxes, what I was not expecting was some places had not only the same price like at the mall but higher! They had higher prices then they where promoting a sale and telling you how much your saving but in reality it came down to the same price like place rosemere & Carrefour mall. Very disappointed! It will be full during the holidays but after that during the  hard months of January & February they better bring down the prices or they will suffer deeply. Best stores I found that had good prices hagger, puma & the bay. Only time will tell what the future holds.
4261	0	a	After waiting two and a half hours for my food and calling four times the woman I spoke too blamed me for not answering my phone. The reason I did not answer was because they called the wrong number, which they also typed incorrectly on the receipt which the driver showed me while he apologized for the stupidity of his coworkers. The food was horrible. I fed it to my dog.  AVOID AT ALL COSTS.
4262	0	a	"Currently sitting at 2 (TWO) hours waiting for delivery that I ordered off Grub Hub from here. We got a pizza, wings and a cheesesteak and fries.\n\nTWO.\n\nHOURS.\n\nOn a Tuesday evening with no sporting events or other extenuating circumstances going on.\n\nOn the off chance this is literally the best food I'll ever eat in my entire life, I will never order from here again. They tossed me a 10% discount and said, \""I don't know, the delivery guy got stuck in traffic, I honestly couldn't tell you,\"" when I called to ask what the hell was going on.\n\nWe just got it as I finished that. As I suspected: waxy, microwaved pizza, the worst cheesesteak I've ever had, and soggy, unsalted fries. The fact that they somehow managed not to screw up the wings is a minor miracle entirely overshadowed by how overwhelmingly terrible that food was. Atrocious from beginning to end. Never again."
4263	1	a	No alcohol? Two star Nikki, two star. I'm kidding.:-)\nAnother teriffic event with some amazing food. Nikki did a great job setting this event up and I thought the chalkboard name cards were really cool.\nLongHorn was a terrific host and you could see their passion for meals that they serve. The new appetizers are delicious especially the corn fritters. I was almost full by the time my steak came out and I still had to find room for dessert. And boy am I glad I did. LongHorn serves up some decadent desserts. They were even kind enough to sample out a caramel apple dessert they had not planned on because of the dietary needs of one of the guests.\nOverall LongerHorn was very generous with some delicious new foods and a few giveaways. It certainly left a favorable impression.
4264	1	a	Amazing food & amazing conversation made for the perfect Monday night. The small group setting was really awesome. It was a great opportunity to get some face time with fellow Charlotte Yelp Elites. The team at LongHorn Steakhouse really outdid themselves for the Steak-ation. Service was extremely attentive and took care of every need. David and his team deserve a huge shout out!! Awesome job!\n\nAs always, a huge thanks to Nikki for making this event available to us.
4265	1	a	I was in Phoenix on business and went to Urban Warfit CrossFit 602 as a drop-in. The entire staff was very nice and made me feel welcome right away. I enjoyed the challenging workouts and the facility itself. I will go back there again anytime I'm in the Phoenix area for work. I'd also highly recommend it to anyone else traveling to the Phoenix/Tempe area.
4266	1	a	Urban Warfit Crossfit 602 welcomed me and my wife right away after it didnt work out at another box. From day one they made us feel like we have been going there for years. Roman, Ken, and the other coaches are very knowledgeable and friendly.  Urban Warfit Cossfit 602 has the best community hands down....I've made great friends and reached PRs thanks to the community, coaching and programming at Urban. So come out and join us you will not regret it.
4267	0	a	Very slow. Waited for about 4 min before someone would take our order, and it took 5 more min to get kids smoothie. Other Jambas we're in and out in less than 5 min.
4268	0	a	I'm only giving 2 stars because the employees genuinely look happy to work here (hope you sense my sarcasm). Horrible unhappy unfriendly people working here makes my Jamba Juice experience horrible.
4269	0	a	I usually love Jamba Juice, but this location is lacking. I've been here a few times now and every time there has been a wait. The last visit, there were 4 people ahead of me already waiting for their orders with only one girl making the smoothies. So it was a 10+ minute wait for my order. I ordered a strawberry bowl which comes with granola and topped with bananas ad fresh strawberries. As the cashier was assembling the bowl, he stopped to take someone else's order, handled cash and then proceeded to assemble my bowl again. He did put on gloves but did not wash his hands before putting on the gloves. So pretty much he put on dirty gloves. I used to work in the food industry and that was totally unacceptable. Too bad...looks like I have to go to a farther location to get my smoothie fix.
4270	1	a	Burger21 was a great experience. You can taste the freshness in the meat with every bite. After talking with the owner for a few minutes you can tell his passion for food and burgers. They have a vast selection of burgers, and food. They have close to 10+ different dipping sauces and was very impressed.\n\nThe only item I wished had a little better taste or texture would be the generic regular fries. \n\nHats off to Burger21 and I am glad to add this to my lunch rotation.
4271	1	a	Keepin it simple.\n\nBurgers were great. Absolutely great. And if I rated just on burgers, I'd give this place five stars. But I dont.\n\nI was really bummed they didn't have the cheese ale fries - which I heard was fantastic. Who runs out of cheese at a burger place?!?\n\nService was odd. They were friendly...however having six different people come up to you every five minutes with your mouth full of burger was slightly excessive. It passed the point of being attentive to the point where it seemed they were rushing us out...even though there were only two other groups of people there. \n\nLittle pet peeve of mine - employees with cellphones will always create a negative experience for me.\n\nMoving on...ketchup bar!\n\nToasted Marshmallow - disgusting.  It was a cross between vanilla yogurt and icing. Think and runny.\n\nRagin Cajun - nice with a little kick!\n\nThai Ketchup - it was good! Maybe could use a bit more spice.\n\nChipotle Mayo - It's no Copper Blue's,  but it's pretty good.\n\nIn conclusion,  I must admit I like this new little burger place. But perhaps I'll do To-Go next time.
4272	1	a	Great taste and great family friendly atmosphere. Sauce bar provides variety to spice things up.
4273	0	a	Probably wouldn't come back. A burger itself was 8$, fries were 3$, and a shake was 5$. Such a huge price for something completely okay, with a small portion. Service was awful, burgers came out to us 1 at a time for me and my buddies, so by the time we were ready to eat the person who got their food first was out of luck.
4274	0	a	Epic Fail in Service. Good burger, so not worth the wait. Wimpy fries but the cheese ale sauce is good.\nDon't waste your time. Find a Smashburger instead. \nWhen you have an hour for lunch and you can't eat? That's a big fail. I think the 21 stands for 21 hour wait.
4275	1	a	Yet another really good burger option for the Chandler/101 area!\n\nOver the last few months we've gotten a Smash Burger and now a Burger21 last week. If UR into red meat, how can you go wrong?\n\nI came here to grab something for a late night at the office and Burger21 hit the roof of my flavortown mouth. Sorry Fieri!  LOL\n\nI kept it simple. The cardiac arrest Blue Cheese and Bacon burger for only $7.95 and a Chocolate Malt ($4.95) to wash it down. Both were good. \n\nExpect to pay $12 or so, if you order a soft drink. Don't  those iced cold beers looked good? There's a real high probably I'll be back with some co-workers real soon.
4276	0	a	"I would start by saying I had high expectations. I will also say they deserve some grace as the place just opened but they did make 4 of our 5 burgers wrong. Funny detail my 'shroom burger had 1 slice of mushroom on it. They did offer to remake the burgers but I just couldn't see throwing out all of that food.\n\nAs for the food. Pretty good burgers, juicy, good bun. reminded me of an old fashioned hamburger that you rolled yourself at home. But certainly not worth the price. Excellent fries, very crispy with choice of sauce. But again not sure about the $6 basket. \n\nThe decor and atmosphere is trendy and very \""San Fransisco\"".  \n\nOverall I would have to say go across the 101 to Culver's. Though Culver's a much more conservative atmosphere, you will certainly have a better burger, better service and save 30% on your bill. If it makes you feel better donate the 30% you saved to the charity of your choice."
4277	0	a	Food was just ok but nothing to shout home about. The burgers were kinda bland, the fries were not really flavorful and were kinda mushy. I would not go back.
4278	0	a	Not allergy friendly although they appear to be. We went in on 11/25 at 5:30 pm (not busy) and selected the non gluten free menu. On the bottom of the menu it stated to let your server know if you have a food allergy. My child is allergic to dairy and eggs so I asked the server if their brioche had dairy or eggs. She smiled and said she thinks so. I asked her to check so she said she would ask her manager and left. She came back and said it does. I asked if there were any options without and she said no ,everything has dairy and eggs. Now that may very well be, but in my experience at most restaurants, usually the manager would come out or at least we we would be offered an allergen menu. Here, we were offered neither. Their gluten free menu and their allergen statement are useless without proper training.   Unless you are one of the rare people with a medical diagnosis of celiac, gluten is a sensitivity, not an allergy. In other words, your body won't try to kill you if you eat. \nIt is a shame this place  is not a new option for our family. I will never be back, even without my daughter. I will stick with The Habit, it is easier to find parking anyway.
4279	1	a	Walked in before they were officially open and ended up getting a free meal! Got the burger they had on special for the month (forgot the name but it had a fried pickle in it) and it was delicious...and huge! Ops Manager came around and gave me a pumpkin pie shake as well. Will definitely be going back when I want a gourmet burger!
4280	0	a	No attention to detail on the order assembly...messed up my friends burger the first trip here, forgot my friends fries on second trip and forgot my little girls milk on my first trip.  My Tuna burger was very good.  \nThey just need to work on the expediting and order assembly quality control.\nI will try this place again and most likely add a star to my review if all goes well, because the burgers are quite good.
4281	0	a	I didn't want to give a bad review but think it's needed. I went here few weeks ago on my lunch break. After waiting 40 minutes I informed the girl at the counter I now need it to go (lunch was almost over) no apology for how long it took. I then didn't have time to eat. I get cranky hungry! Not to mention it's pricey, Ecspecially when you need gluten-free. A lot of money to not eat. I decided to email the business to give them a heads up of the service (slow and not sorry). Figured a manager would care, nope. See why employees don't. No email apology or anything. Bummed, was excited for new gluten-free options.
4282	0	a	I struggle with this review.  I have been to B21 a couple times for the turkey club - almost always a delicious burger unless the cook burns the crap out of one side and still serves it!  (That only happened one time though).  So I will say the food deserves 3 stars.  However, everytime I order this artisan burger the bun is a veritable hockey puck.  Inedible!!!   So, in the spirit of eating healthier I just toss the bun aside and eat the turkey patty (yum!)! \n\nThe 2 stars are for the cleanliness of the place.  It's slow most times that I go and the bar with the drinks and sauces is disgusting.  Additionally, the floors are just as gross.  \n\nI agree with everyone - overpriced food.
4283	0	a	I decided to give this place a review after my second visit.  New Years day, no one except employees were there and they still screwed it up.  I order the black and bleu burger for my second time.  This time they forgot to season the burger so it was pretty bland.  The bun appeared to be stale and cold as it was crumbling apart at the bottom making the burger messy to eat.\n\nThe guy at the counter who kept sneezing in his hand and wiping it on his jeans rung my daughters order up wrong so it had to be remade.  I didn't bother telling them about my burger because I knew the kids could not sit still much longer.  \n\nWhat irked me the most (besides the sneezing counter guy) was when I was ordering the food for the kids, I was offered fruit, applesauce, fries or sweet potato fries as their side options.  I picked sweet potato fries for both.  I was not informed that there was an up charge.  I didn't realize it until I checked my receipt.  That ticks me off to no end.\n\nBottom line, if you have a empty restaurant (and I mean empty) and a fully stocked up staff, nothing should go wrong.  This place is in a good area and the prices are high.  I probably won't return because I spent a good amount of money and got very little satisfaction.
4284	0	a	I had been wanting to try Burger 21 since it opened and finally made my way over to the Chandler location on New Years. The store was empty and there was no one at the counter. All the workers were sitting down enjoying sodas chatting with friends. Totally unacceptable. I order two burgers and their chicken strips with a side of fries. I was not impressed. The brioche bun overpowers the meat the in both taste and size. The patty was very thin for it to be a $7 burger. The bun was cold even though the bum was supposedly toasted. Definitely better burger joints out there. This is probably the worst of the new burger restaurants/chain.
4285	1	a	First time here since they opened, the pulled pork sandwich is very good with their spicy slaw, brisket is nice and moist, good service, love the baked beans but the potato salad tasted store bought which was disappointing. Overall good food, will return. Wish they would add some smoked meat to the beans however.
4286	0	a	"My work mates and I purchased lunch to go.  What a mistake. I ordered the hot link combo $8 and the 2 \""sides\"" are about 3 oz each.  The coleslaw was a soggy mess. The potato salad and bun were definitely from Costco.  If I wanted Costco I would have paid $1.75 for huge polish dog & soda .  I ate the link only and potato salad.  I'm still hungry, what a bummer...."
4287	1	a	Glad we came to this just opened BBQ spot! There was plenty of meat on the ribs and the pulled pork carolina sandwich was good too. The cashier recommended the bbq beans and I'm glad she did bc they were really good. Will be back to try more..
4288	0	a	Walked into the Cherry Tree smokehouse today, place was empty except for 1 table at 11:45. not a good sign so far. no real direction on what to do when you enter except to go to the front desk and wait for someone to show up. looks very under staffed. I only see 2 people running around. this is lunch time! any good place for lunch has a lunch rush and prepares for it! i asked for a sample of the brisket and it took 10 minutes just for him to have the other guy slice it and finally give it to me. there was no line behind me when i ordered the sample... and when i finally got the sample i had 10  people behind me. so i ordered my food before i got the sample in hope to help them process these people quicker, but it was just simply understaffed. then sadly i was not impressed by the flavorless chewy brisket. does not even come close to little miss BBQ brisket. finally,  around 12 a lady showed up to help them, just in time for the rush. i ordered the pulled pork sandwich with a combo. what is the combo you ask? not sure. had to get back in line after my order to figure out what comes with the combo and for goodness sakes give me my drink! i thought that was standard. then dude gives me a can of Dr. Pepper. little disappointed that there is no refills. $11.86 for a combo and i get a tiny little bite sized looking corn bread, some cheap chips, and a can of soda. where is the value? my pulled pork sandwich looked like it got the crap beat out of it, then grilled to warm it up for serving. not saying thats what they do... it just looks like the most haggard pulled pork sandwich I've ever seen. so i finally started eating and the pork was dried out, so i rescue it with a bunch of BBQ sauce and it was decent. not flavorless, but needs a lot more flavor. i did eat it all so it was edible. really wanted to like this place but it lacks flavor and customer service. i saw all the poor reviews for this place and had to see for myself. so i conclude that it's over priced and the value is not there. it has potential, so i'll visit back in about 6 months to see how they are doing. good luck Cherry Tree you have a nice little place.
4289	0	a	EKK- Pass this place. \n\nI came into this place for the first time the other day and i was having high hopes for a new, awesome BBQ place close to home- this was not it. \n\nAt first glance, i was surprised to see the menue only has brisket on select days, no mac-n-cheese anywhere in sight and the prices are on the high side. \n\nI ordered a split meat platter- pulled chicken and pulled pork, corn bread and chips. My meat was such a small portion i was shocked- not to mention, my pulled chicken was not pulled, it was roughly chopped and tasted like cheap chinese food quality chicken. the cornbread was filled with jalojenos (which it did not say on the menue!) and the chips were a small bag of lunch sytle lays... The pork was good. I have to give credit when credit is due. \n\nOther than that, the server was slow and could care less that she took forever to refill drinks or that she took a long time to bring the food to our table, bringing the food in shifts with 5-10 minutes inbetween each persons food. \n\nThe cherry on the cake was when we were getting up to leave we say her offering samples to other patrons so they could try the different types of meat before they picked their meals- We would have LOVEDDD this option, bc had we tried a few things before we picked we probably would have been much happier.
4290	0	a	Prices extremely high. Prices were a big turn off. Weird parking areas. Sample of pork bellie seemed like it was steamed. Really didnt like it. Brisket sandwich was dry and there was no smoke flavor. Bbq should never need salt.
4291	1	a	Our new favorite! My wife and I came for a late breakfast and coffee. We ordered the quinoa pancakes and French toast with fresh whipped cream and berry compote and a couple of lattes. \n\nService: Very friendly. I chatted with employee John for a couple of minutes and felt very welcomed. I definitely noticed the great care taken by all staff when taking the order, preparing it, and delivering it. They clearly want your experience to be memorable. \n\nFood: The food was delicious. French toast was slightly crispy and not soggy, which was a nice change. The pancakes were tasty as well. The freshly whipped cream was a nice touch, and the berry compote was very flavorful. Out lattes were some of the most silky I've had. \n\nAmbience: Beautiful bronze tiled ceiling and paint color choices. Nothing really on the walls quite yet but was told there will be soon. The tables and chairs were modern and comfortable. The Wi-Fi was a little confusing though. \n\nOverall: Bead and Berry is a fresh and hip new place for Maricopa. We look forward to our next visit and can't wait to try the keylime smoothie!
4292	1	a	Norman Zheng is a wonderful realtor who is honest, caring, and takes the time to answer the questions, or finds the answers for us.\n\nMy wife and I feel so blessed to have had Norman as our buyer's agent.  Our 9-day escrow closed ON-TIME, which is totally a credit to Norman.  Even though the entire process was sometimes unpredictable and scary, it was made right, thanks to Norman's persistence, patience, and passion for taking care of his clients.  When the wife is happy, the family is happy!  We've closed escrow for over a week now, and our family is very happy today with our home purchase!
4293	1	a	Super fresh seafood in Plaza Midwood - yeah!  They have been selling at the Common Market all summer and now have their own brick and mortar.  We've had so much tasty fish from them in recent months - wreckfish, flounder, shrimp, halibut, tilefish, clams.  The fish is so tasty - you just need a little salt and pepper and that's it. Almost all of it is from the Carolina coast.  Now they're selling Duke's Bread and Dover Farms produce and they're about to team up with Pasta and Provisions!  They've fulfilled my dream of coming home after work and stopping for super fresh local seafood for an incredible dinner. This is one of the best additions to Charlotte in quite some time.  Wishing them lots of success!
4294	1	a	The ambiance is very cool, very quaint and adorable.  I love the feel of the potted plants all around outside.  My favorite of this place is the salsa!  A very simple chips and salsa but they nailed it- just the right kind of spice and flavor, very good.  My second favorite part is the selection of condiments/sauces that they bring to your table.  My husband is a huge condiments fan, I can't wait to take him here.  I didn't go full 5 stars because our server wasn't the brightest- couldn't hear me at all and didn't get my order right.  However, everything was really tasty and very reasonably priced!  Total bill for a friend and I with drinks was less than $40.  I would absolutely recommend this place to friends and family.
4295	1	a	Awesome new spot in Old Town! The retro feel in this Mexican restaurant was super unique. Patio seating with a fireplace is always an added bonus in AZ. The margaritas were exceptional. We had the traditional poke appetizer, good for a couple people. For dinner we tried the braised pineapple pork bowl and the shrimp tacos. Outstanding! They have a nice selection of homemade salsa/dressings to try with your meals, too. Really enjoyed this place and will definitely be back soon!
4296	1	a	I have been here twice and I have loved it both times! The decor is super cool, the staff are super friendly and the drinks are delish! My fav. Is the Mexican Trail Mix Salad sooo yummy and the Brussel sprout nacho thing is out of this world crazy but ultra delicious- you have to try it! \n\nParking is convenient! Will be going back soon!
4297	1	a	A welcome addition to a neighborhood in need of better taco offerings.  Will carve out a nice niche, better than America's but not quite as pricey and crowded as Barrio Queen.  The salsa bar makes highlights the best chips in the area and their seafood offerings are among the best on the menu.
4298	1	a	Great food, super atmosphere, friendly service. The tacos are very  filling , start with two  and  add more if needed!
4299	1	a	Had a really solid meal here on Taco Monday. We had the Brussels sprout nachos which were very unique a tasty. We also had the pineapple braised pork, bbq chicken, and crispy cod tacos. All three were very good, especially for the two dollar price point. Service was great. I'll definitely be back.
4300	1	a	New kids on the block in Scottsdale.....great tacos and atmosphere. Can't miss the bright pink neon sign outside. Brussels sprout nachos looked amazing....if you're into that sort of thing! A great place for taco Tuesday!
4301	1	a	A nice revision of the previous Tavern and I think, good use of one of those classic brick buildings that make up much of the historical development on Mill Avenue. The owners of Blasted Barley wisely made a decision to implement the windows that open up the bar to the outside when the weather is good - something popularized in the creation of HandleBar grill by the Fork and Dagger consortium, which runs so many good eating places on Mill. I also like the outside seating layout and of course, the prominent view of the brewing equipment, which should go into production any day now.\n\nAs for eating experience, I will say that the mix of light type on the menus and low lighting can make for a challenging reading experience. Though the faded type is cool, it isn't all that functional so please, back to dark, solid font on the menu and the happy hour menu - I had to get the bartender to help me find a nice Belgian from the menu and even she had some trouble reading down the list - so maybe some larger type as well.\n\nAs for the food and drink, not necessarily in that order, they do adjust the glass for the beer one is drinking, which is a nice nod to proper craft beer treatment. I also had the traditional wings off the happy hour list and quite good - seasoned but not overly saucy and served in a nice stainless steel bowl that was rather functional an unique. I hope to come back and try the curried cauliflower sliders.\n\nFinally, I found the culture of the establishment to be a bit of a cultural mishmash with both craft brew on tap, but also beer from traditional large beverage providers, but that may just be an economic necessity due to the location. If those beers don't sell I hope Blasted Barley considers pulling them from a menu as they don't align with the craft beer and distillery brand that I think Blasted Barley is using to differentiate itself. If nothing else, carry those in the bottle but not on tap. \n\nFinally, tried the barrel aged cocktail on tap - hmmm, a bit heavy on the orange peel flavor - I recommend calling it a barrel aged variation of the old fashioned versus a name referring to something provocative as I'm assuming another part of the brand mission is popularizing classic cocktails - I'd like to see that aspect of what this establishment can bring to Mill emphasized and I think there is the population to support that sort of quality cocktail emphasis.\n\nSuffice to say, I like Blasted Barley but I think it is working through a bit of an identity crisis - traditional college bar or cater to that strain of gentrification wafting through the halls of historical development on Mill Avenue? Suffice to say, I'll be stopping by and watching the possible changes but Blasted Barley is a step in the right direction.
4302	1	a	Good choice of craft beers and the food was great.  The hamburger bun was bordering on amazing.
4303	1	a	I haven't had a chance to try the food but I did take a look at the menu and was intrigued.\n\nVery hip and current ambiance. Some great beer offerings. Although they are brand new the staff seemed to have everything under control and running smoothly. I can really appreciate that. I look forward to my next visit!
4304	1	a	Fantastic breakfast in Uptown Waterloo. They have a simple menu that's well priced, and great coffee to match the food. \n\nFor lunch or dinner you'll also find a simple but complete menu that matches the beer available on tap. From a couple in house brews to some local classics you'll find something you like.
4305	1	a	"This place has great potential for fun times with a huge outdoor patio and bar. I'm already visualizing the Cinco de Mayo party. The outdoor fire  was lit up on this chilly night and as you walk in, you're greeted by the friendly staff and welcoming patio. The indoor bar area was designed very well, with high tables, low tables and a long bar running the length of the room. The restaurant has a comfortable setting throughout. The music was hit or miss...for a tequila restaurant and bar, I would expect something more upbeat than the Righteous Bros. I think they are still working out the kinks on music but I'd go with your traditional Mexican theme. We don't really need another Chuys. What I mean is...there is room for a legit Mexican restaurant in town so own it. Your space lends itself to the title. The queso and guacamole were crowd pleasers. Chips and salsa were not free. I'm from California and never have I visited a Mexican restaurant that doesn't provide free chips and salsa. Considering your $10 micro-margaritas, I think it's something you might consider. We ordered it anyway and it was average (marinara tasting) but extremely fresh tasting. In fact, everything here seemed fresh and made with care. I would go with the queso before the salsa. The chips were impressive and unique. The margaritas were delicious (legit with lime juice and tequila) but also very small (dusted in a few slurps). There was more ice in the glass than liquid. I think the idea was to let the ice melt but I was too thirsty and the 3-4 ounces were gone quick. Kudos for having local beers on taps. The tacos were in flour tortillas and served street style. Between the 4 of us, I think we tried all of them. I loved the grilled chicken but will pass on the carnitas next time. My chicken taco was hearty but the carnitas taco was quite skimpy and the biggest chunk, a piece of fat. Others confirmed the grilled chicken was good. I didn't hear any comments (good or bad) about the mahi or steak tacos on the other side of the table. The white bean side was interesting. I'm not sure if I would go that route again but I'm glad I tried it. Huge tip: Park around the back of the building. Traveling on Providence towards Uptown, pass The Villa and make your first right. Then take your second right into the clearly marked, The Villa Parking Lot. The entrance to RuRu's is actually in back so it's a win-win. Don't park in front - limited spaces and you'll have to walk around anyway. A large parking lot was a huge plus. Lastly, service was prompt and friendly. The new employees seem happy but it was also apparent that the names of the dishes (all movie lines such as my favorite \""Fat Guy in a Little Coat\"", was a confusing way to name dishes versus calling it, Grilled Chicken Taco. It was fun though. This is a happy addition to Charlotte and I hope they continue to improve on a great foundation. I cannot stress enough how awesome the design of the restaurant and bar are. We also liked the street style taco and small portions for good value. Even with my few not so favorable comments, it's well deserving of 4 stars after two days of being open. I'm sure it will get better and better with time. And, if you want us to buy tequila, then we want to hear some lively music at the risk of changing your Hollywood, eclectic Pandora station."
4306	1	a	Upon entering, the patio is incredible!  I Once the temperature warms up, that will be one serious hot spot.  It's all set in a gorgeous 1920's villa, and it visually does not disappoint.  The music was slightly a buzz kill (Shaggy, Blink 182 , Smash Mouth, and other 90's songs..) but I'm hoping they'll work out the kink on that one.  The staff was very welcoming and friendly, happy to suggest items from the menu.  The items on the menu are all named from lines from movies, which is really fun!  Food was great - Wonderful chili queso, tacos are priced between $3-$4, sides additional, and I thought $9 for a small bowl of chili was a little steep.  They offer a very eclectic cocktail menu and frozen margaritas which is also a nice addition.  Overall, great place!  I knocked off a star for the music and pricing, and the fact that chips and salsa weren't free..  Other than that, a must try.
4307	1	a	For years, I have wanted a restaurant to move into this location, in a gorgeous 1920's Spanish villa.  I've always thought that the back patio is gorgeous and would be a fantastic spot for a restaurant; I am so glad that RuRu's decided to go into this location!\n\nAs other reviewers have said, the patio is a-mazing.  I can not wait for nicer weather.  There is an outdoor bar, tv, lots of tables / benches, and a beautiful fountain.  \n\nWe tried RuRu's on a Wednesday - we arrived around 6:30 and there were plenty of tables available.  When we left at 8, the place was pretty hopping, but I don't believe there was a wait.  \n\nThe food was good, but it's kind of a bummer that you have to pay $5 for chips and salsa (this made me give 4 stars instead of 5).  We got the chips and queso ($7) and it was delicious.  The chips are homemade and the queso was some of the best I have ever had.  We both got quesadillas for our entrees - womp womp, we are boring.  I guess we covered the melted cheese and bread options they had, though.\n\nThey have a fun drink menu and everything on the menu is named after memorable lines / nicknames from movies.  I took a pic of the menu; sorry if it is a little blurry.  I'll definitely be back and absolutely can not wait for warmer weather so we can enjoy the patio out back!
4308	0	a	Really?  Having to pay for chips and salsa at a mexican restaurant? Plus the salsa sucked. \n\nAlso no kids menu. \n\nOn the plus side, the burrito and quesadilla were okay.
4309	1	a	Been here twice and have not been disappointed. Take some time and really explore the menu...and the cocktail list has some hidden gems on there as well. The menu names are killer....can't wait to go back again.
4310	1	a	I can't say enough good things about this place!\n\nWe went here on a whim early one Saturday night, and we weren't disappointed!  The atmosphere was really cool, and our waitress was very kind and genuine with great recommendations.\n\nWe ordered several tacos and apps, and the crispy fried chicken, shrimp, fried oyster, and carnitas tacos were our favorite.  I don't know what they put in that zesty sauce, but it's perfect! I also really liked the balance and texture of the different toppings on each taco. I'd also recommend ordering the special queso to go with the tacos, because isn't everything better with cheese sauce to dip it in?!?\n\nOh, and the WINGS--- you absolutely have to order the wings!! My husband and I are big foodies, and I have to say, these are the best wings we've ever had.  (I know, weird considering this is supposed to be a Mexican place lol).  The slight crispy texture, the sweet and yet spicy glaze sauce, and the horseradish crema on top were just phenomenal!\n\nTheir version of Guac was really the only thing I wasn't a fan of, but other than that, a flawless experience!
4311	0	a	First off, where are you supposed to park? We found a spot in the back in a tiny parking lot, which then put us in the back entrance of the restaurant which is set up like a long narrow house. We had a group of 7 - and they put us in what I guess would be the living room with bookshelves, a fireplace and a few small tables. Which is unique, but where are we supposed to eat? \n\nI ordered a $10 margarita - it was ok. A little tart for my liking. And we all shared the trio which was guac, queso & salsa. This would have been better to share if we were sitting at a table! We all ordered some tacos and honestly no one was impressed! They were fine, but Ive had better. The prices were a little on the high side so not sure we'll be back.
4312	0	a	Pretty good food, but crappy service.  This was our first time here, so we ordered waters with a few food items to test the waters...  The bartender took our order and we never saw him again.  We couldn't even order any cocktails or more food, which is a shame because it was really tasty.  We had to suck on ice cubes to soothe or tonnes from the spicy food.  Not a good first impression for a new restaurant.
4313	0	a	I walked out of Ru Ru's the first time thinking the place had great potential. They definitely need to work on their service - it's slow and having all the staff linger around the bar, chit chat and eat there seemed a little weird/unprofessional? But whatever, place seems cool - I'd come back here with friends! The ambiance is beautiful and I was already envisioning spending many warm afternoons and evening on their patio enjoying a margarita or two. I came back a week later with some friends and this time we walked out just after a round of drinks and apps because the food was unimpressive and some aspects of the service were pretty bad too. My first time there we tried all the tacos and while the two chicken ones (fried & grilled) were really good, the others were mediocre. My second visit there we had the chips and guac, wings and calamari. The calamari was good, the guac was ok, but the wings were very gamey. What really drove us out though were the drinks. Aside from taking forever to get to us, they weren't even good. We also had a live bartending lesson going on behind our table at the bar, because of which they turned off the music. Really? \nwe had to request it be turned back on (which they did eventually) because the place was really quiet and we could hear the step by step instructions on how our drinks were being prepared. Nothing wrong with that, but it was killing the vibe a bit. It's a great location, great set-up, perhaps it's still a diamond in the rough and needs a little more time?
4314	0	a	"We had a group of 12 at RuRu's for dinner on a Friday night. I called the day of to make a reservation. We got there early, so we could try the cocktails. The margarita is good, but small for $9.50. Unfortunately, it was raining and the outdoor bar was not open. The outdoor space is great with heaters, TVs and a large bar.  The hostess took us to our table, which she was helping setup. The table was set for 10 people. I told her we had 12 and her response was \""ok\"". She disappeared and never returned. We squeezed 12 at our table until the 2 top next to us closed out. Our waiter asked if we wanted to order appetizers but none of us had menus. It took 2 times asking and another 20 minutes to get a diet coke. The food was so-so and the service slow and confused.  But the worst part is the chips and salsa are $5. Even the beautiful outdoor space won't make me return."
4315	1	a	"Stopped in the Phoenix area and looked up places to eat. Found this spot and I'm always a sucker for loaded baked potatoes. Stopped by and was greeted by the very friendly Miss \""D\"". Lots of ways to load up your spud and from the smells that were coming from the kitchen I was looking forward to my order. Ordered a Jumbo with pulled pork. Miss \""D\"" helped make some suggestions, and I wasn't disappointed. A lot of times I get a baked potato and I always feel the toppings are skimped on. Not here, great topping to spud ratio. The interior is pretty bare, more for a takeout spot and you could easily drive by it, but stop in and try it out."
4316	0	a	I never went to the old restaurant that inhabited this building so I can't make any comparisons with it, but regardless of this I would never go back after coming here recently.\n\nThe decor was mediocre and I would normally look past this if the food was up to par, but unfortunately it was not.\n\nThe first problem with my meal was that when the waitress brought out my water, the rim of the glass was covered with this black gunk that looked like dried mud which pretty gross and nearly ruined my appetite.  How nobody saw this before it got to me is pretty confusing.\n\nMoving on from this, the bread brought for the table was dry and stale tasting.  The margherita pizza I ordered was extremely mediocre with bleh cheese, watery tomato sauce, and OK dough (not very airy).\n\nIf you're looking to get a bite to eat for lunch or otherwise, I'd recommend any of the surrounding restaurants over this one.
4317	0	a	I visited on Wed. for a lunch with my lab group, per the suggestion of my lab manager.  Although this was a lab lunch, the occasion that prompted it was my birthday last week.  It's a good thing that my boss wasn't available on my actual birthday, because based on my experience here, I would have felt seriously shortchanged.\n\nDespite having a not-so-great experience at Joe Mama's (the previous instantiation of this restaurant; see my previous review) in the month before it changed hands, I was eager to give this place a second chance, in light of the updated menu and new ownership.  Upon entering, the space seemed cleaner than before, which was encouraging.  Unfortunately, however, my optimism was short-lived, since this turned out to be the most positive thing I could say about my visit.\n\nIn terms of the food, I suspected from the point that our table received the slightly-stale bread with its overly sweet oil and vinegar accompaniment that I was in for a disappointment, even though I (foolishly) continued to hold out hope.  My boss ordered the bruschetta for our table to share, which was served on the same slightly-stale bread, and was dressed with pale, tasteless tomatoes and bland pesto.  For my entree, I ordered the rigatoni al pesto, which comes dressed with a basil cream sauce with tomatoes, grilled chicken, and parmesan.  Although I love all of these ingredients, most of which are very flavorful, this dish turned out to be extremely flavorless.  Adding grated parmesan, salt, and pepper helped a bit, but unfortunately was unable to redeem it.  Moreover, the rigatoni were overcooked and overly soft, to the point that they fell apart upon the slightest touch of my fork.  The dish came with an unmemorable side salad instead of the huge shared salad bowl of Joe Mama's.  It was very clear that the ingredients used in all of the food were low quality.\n\nTo add insult onto injury, service was extremely slow.  From the time that we sat down to the time that we left, an hour and a half elapsed, despite that we only ordered appetizers and entrees.  Even my boss became frustrated with the slowness of the service, since he had to go to a meeting after lunch--he offered to reimburse the lab manager and got up to leave.  At last, our waitress must have sensed my boss's urgency, since she came by as he was getting up, and ran his credit card promptly, so that the lab manager didn't have to pay.\n\nNeedless to say, despite my initial optimism, I was disappointed with the quality of the food and service here.  While I certainly wasn't a fan of Joe Mama's, at least it didn't pretend to be upscale, so you didn't go in with high expectations.  If you're looking for a sit-down lunch in Oakland, I'd suggest The Porch, Spice Island Tea House, or even Winghart's. If you're looking for Italian food at a similar price point, I'd suggest trying Girasole in Shadyside.  I'd even suggest the Olive Garden over this place, since I've had better meals there, and at least they give you unlimited salad and breadsticks!
4318	0	a	Don't be fooled. This is NOT some upgrade in quality of food compared with Joe Mama's. It's a pig with some lipstick on. \n\nThe pasta is very obviously from the same frozen packages they use at your run of the mill Italian places around the country. I thought, maybe my ravioli will have some nice homemade touch to it? Nope. Straight from the freezer- sauce was from a can. \n\nMy friend's pasta dish with chicken was extremely light on chicken- there were 5 small pieces on the dish. Sauce was meh as well. Also-both of our pasta portions were decidedly small. \n\nThey haven't really done much with the decor- they took down all the fake celebrity pictures, redid the menu in Italian, and changed the name. I liked that Joe Mamas despite having mediocre food could take a joke. \n\nThough- no complaints about the service which was excellent. Our waitress was extremely friendly and proactive. Also- half off wine bottles on Wednesday from 6-?(can't remember). And since most of them are $30-$40 normally that's very good. \n\nBottom line- these weak $14 pasta dishes aren't worth your time. They need a chef if they want to charge the prices they do. In fact- I think Noodles across the street is significantly better and cheaper. And for a nice dinner in Oakland The Porch has slightly better food and a dramatically better atmosphere. \n\nIt's too bad- I thought we might have a Piccolo Forno in Oakland but that is not the case.
4319	0	a	My husband and I took both sets of our parents to Olio, prior to a Pitt Basketball game. Our reservation  was at 5:30 and we barely made it out for the 7:30 tip off! The service was THAT slow. Our server was very sweet, but she was clearly overwhelmed and didn't have the support to handle her tables effectively. \n\nAs for the food...we started with a few pizzas. They were good, but I can't help but compare to local Neapolitan-style titan il pizzaiolo. And honestly, there is no comparison. Olio's crust was slightly undercooked leaving it very doughy. The toppings were average quality and the sauce had a 'tomatoes-from-a-can' flavor. \n\nMost of our party enjoyed the entrees. I thought my husband's chicken Marsala had odd proportions of the (tiny) chicken entree to the side of pasta. All of us agreed that the pastas were overcooked. Al dente pasta is the simplest aspect of Italian cooking and should be a given, whether dining at a national chain or on the Amalfi coast. Again, the canned flavor wasn't cooked out of the tomato sauces, and my meatballs were hard as rocks and completely lacking seasoning. The best thing I had all evening was the Casa salad. That's a start, I guess.\n\nWe had to leave for the game, so no time for dessert. Something tells me we didn't miss much. \n\nAt least Olio's predecessor (Joe Mama's) didn't pretend to be something it wasn't!
4320	0	a	"DO NOT SHOP HERE!!!\n\nI had a very similar issue to Michelle.  Wow at least they are consistent.  \n\nPurchased an electronic cigarette in February was promised it has a \""Lifetime Warranty\"".  E-cig broke in November of same year.  Called in advance to make sure there would be no problems and was told \""Bring it on in\""  Upon trying to get e-cig replaced was told there would be a \""Restock Fee\"" which is the same price of buying a new unit.  Nice \""Lifetime Warranty\"" Vapor Tech!  Spoke to \""Managers\"" at 2 separate locations (Jessica - Dessert Sky Mall & Frank - Arizona Mills Mall) and they are \""unable\"" to do anything.  Frank specifically was very rude and has terrible customer service skill and I told him that to his face.  Spoke to main office on 35th ave and was told there was nothing they could do.  DO NOT SHOP HERE!  They are only out to get your money!  Will also be posting this to BBB, Google reviews, yelp, twitter, etc....."
4321	1	a	I also purchased a mod setup for about $120 which included an Darkhorse rda, two Efests & I2 charger, a few juices as well & had a decent experience at that particular time. The salesman was knowledgeable, informative, & also built a custom build for me for free. Last week, I happened to lose a pin & spring from my mod & also had to pay a shipping fee. It was small, around $20-$30 (I can't remember exactly) to replace my mod right then & there. I paid & left so stoked, I even was able to switch out my new mod to a different color. Yeah I can totally buy the same mod online for less than I paid but you can get EVERYTHING online cheaper, & who wants to wait a week for shipping just to spare a few bucks? How do I know the quality of what I am buying since I can't see it or touch it? Yeah, I'll just pay the shipping fee... I do know that if I was to buy from other vape shops or smoke shops, I defiantly wouldn't be walking out with anything replaced for free or with a warranty (Unless it was an authentic & I went through the direct manufacturer) I have shopped many vape shops throughout the valley & VaporTech's prices are reasonable if not lower than most shops I've found. From what I seen they stocked good variety on just about everything. The juice is decent although, Iam stuck on LA- strawberry lemonade & PHX- berry custard. \n\nI can't say I had the same experience as above, but sounds to me that people are looking for freebies. Ain't gonna find that in the vape world that's for sure.
4322	1	a	Jaime Diamond is amazing! A true artist when it comes to hair color. Her passion for hair and design is incredible. Pricing is extremely affordable. The space for her salon is cozy and comfortable and she has every product imaginable! I don't trust many people with my hair, however, I would be crazy not to recommend her!
4323	1	a	Wolfgang Puck's Bar and Grill is my favorite restaurant in town. I was very happy to hear that they were putting one in downtown Summerlin. We ate there the day after they opened and the food was delicious. The staff was cheerful and friendly which is what I have come to expect in any Wolfgang Puck establishment. We had a wonderful evening. The Ambience wasn't great - it was kind of industrial chic. I hope they put up some photos like they have at the other Wolfgang Puck bar and Grill in town otherwise it could have been any restaurant. As it is now, the only way you would know you were dining at Wolfgang Puck's bar and Grill is because of the friendly service and the delicious food - which is okay by me.
4324	0	a	Great atmosphere, friendly service.... But the food was average at best and overpriced.... Made a reservation... Got there a little early... It was crowded so had to wait about 30 minutes anyway.... Order a bottle of wine, Malbec, they were out and had to settle for second choice... Ordered the short rib and had to settle for second choice again... Ordered the Strip steak medium rare.... It came out well done and had to send it back... Brownie dessert was as if from a school cafeteria... I wanted to work with them on this but there was no soft landing on this almost $300 dinner for five...
4325	0	a	Went to dinner there Tuesday night. Even though the place was empty, the hostess seated us right next to the bus station for water service. We asked if we could be seated at quieter table, and the hostess accommodated us. \n\nWithin five minutes, sirens started going off. Flashing lights, klaxons, and a loudspeaker that told us to evacuate the building.  The waiter came to our table, and told us not to worry, they were just testing out the emergency response system. After he left, the loudspeaker again told us to a evacuate the building. It repeated this message at least 40 times.  He said they had to do this because it was a new building.  The alarm was very loud and lasted through the majority of our dining room visit..  \n\nWe were given only a feeble apology.  We were never offered a complimentary drink, a complementary appetizer, or a complimentary dessert.\n\nMy recommendation to the management is to test equipment before dining service begins.
4326	0	a	Very slow service. had three people  bring the food, but it the follow up or service after that. No drink refills, waited 10.minute between boxing leftovers a d getting the check.
4327	0	a	TERRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE PER THE MANAGER. \n\nJust left five minutes ago to eat at crave after a subpar experience. Ordered the burger and asked to add mushroom and spinach. Waiter came back and told me that it would be an extra 9 dollars to add the two so I declined considering the burger is only 12 dollars. Asked for a menu to change my order and nothing else seemed all that great. That's when I decided to leave. Asked the waiter if I needed to pay for the untouched water and Arnold Palmer I ordered and he had the manager come over to speak with me. The manager explained that the reason for the high price is because they use a wild mushroom. He kept saying he didn't want me to feel as though I was being cheated. I felt fine until the waiter brought over a ten dollar check for the water and Arnold Palmer. I asked the manager as he passed by why I was being charged and he laughed and said he'd handle it. Absolutely terrible customer service from the very manager. Never will I ever eat here nor shall I suggest anyone come here. Save you money and eat anywhere else.
4328	1	a	First time here..definitely will come back. The service, food and overall vibe of the space is everythibg you woukd expect from a WP property.\n\nI had the Chinese Chicken Salad and a Baked Sweet Potato..random choices on.my part..but delicious and filling.\n\nCannot wait to try the rest of the menu.
4329	1	a	Our first visit to the new Wolfgang Puck Bar & Grill was great!  We sat at the bar and we were able to watch football, enjoy some cocktails, and have a lite lunch. My boyfriend enjoyed beer and I ordered Moscow mules as a refreshing drink of choice.  We then shared a margherita pizza and the creamy mac 'n' cheese.  Both were great choices, but wow the creamy mac 'n' cheese is a must try! \n\nOverall the restaurant is a great choice! Comfortable, relaxing, and enjoyable atmosphere!
4330	0	a	This place is not bad for a quick lunch and the interior is nicely designed. The staff were friendly and the food came out fast. However, the food quality was a little below my expectations. It was not bad, just less than I expected based on price and location.
4331	1	a	There are many places to get take-out/delivery in the East Valley.  There are only a handful that I use consistently....and this place is now one of them!  When I am hungry...I am H-ANGRY....and for this reason, when I order delivery, I expect fast, hot food that tastes great and can satiate the animal in my gut before I smash the fridge!\n\nWe have ordered from Zella's multiple times.  Each time, the food was delivered quickly and came to our door hot, which on its own, definitely isn't worth 5 stars because these are things you expect from a delivery place, especially when you live a mile away.\n\nWhat sets Zella's apart is the quality of the food.  We have ordered multiple items  and below is a breakdown:\n\nBaked Fries:  ORDER THESE!  It doesn't matter what kind...all are MIND NUMBINGLY GOOD. We have tried several and they come SUPER hot, and covered in sauce/toppings/cheese etc.  This place has some magical way of baking the fries so that most of the fries are CRISPY.....EVEN WITH ALL THE CRAZY TOPPINGS!!!  This being said...if you are on a diet, STILL ORDER THESE.  You can do an extra mile or ten on the treadmill the next day and it is WORTH IT.\n\nWings: Boneless or bone-in?  Either.  The bone-in come NOT breaded, just crispy and not swimming in sauce.  The hot buffalo sauce might be from out of a bottle (I honestly don't know), but who cares! The wings are not swimming in it and are not those gross, fatty, grisly kind that some places serve.  The boneless wings are breaded but actually contain meat, and not just breaded grisle.  What's more: despite being sauced, the breading is still crispy and the wings are hot! Crazy!\n\nTOASTED SUBS:  I put that in caps because they are AMAZING.  They aren't the run-though-a-toaster kind that some places offer.  They are buttered and Panini pressed or something.....again, I am not sure quite how it is done, but they come hot, crusty, buttery, and AMAZING.  Full disclosure: I even tried the veggie one.  AND IT BLEW MY MIND.  A sub without meat!?  Being amazing?! Yes.  Somehow....even their veggie toasted sub is amazing.\n\nPizza:  Their pizza is pretty good.  To be honest, we have not tried many of the options available but it did come hot, not too saucy and the crust was crispy.  Great pizza is easy to find here in Gilbert and Zella's is definitely better than mediocre. They offer choices for crust flavorings, which seems to be the standard now for pizza places.  What stands out is the price.  It is way better pizza than what they charge so if you have a bunch of hungry kids or pizza party or something, you are better off getting this instead of the Diabetes-inducing-garbage other chains out there call pizza.....and at least you can enjoy it as an adult.\n\nBurger:  Oddly....it was REALLY good (which you do not expect from a pizza/cheesesteak place).  The patties are not exactly chargrilled (like on a home grill) but they are juicy.  They remind me of a bigger version of a fast food patty (which, if you are like me, you know you LOVE....deep down inside....but pretend not to!). They are not overly huge but not tiny either and it comes with 2 patties already.  The best part: YOU CAN ADD EXTRA PATTIES!!!!  So for instance....IF I want to, I can have my own burger-food-challenge every night in the comfort of my own home....and do it in my underwear!!!  The only downside is that the burger toppings appeared to be the same toppings they use on the pizza, but honestly...can you blame them!?  And it is not like my burger was any less awesome because of it.\n\nFRIED PICKLES:  Personally, I prefer the coins to the spears (most people do, for those that know what I am talking about!).  That being stated, let me ask you.....Have you ever had a BAD fried pickle??  I thought not.  And you won't find a bad one here.\n\nCustomer Service:  I say it in every review I write:  good food is easy to find but good customer service is rare.  This place shines.  If they goof up your order, they are apologetic and do everything in their power to make it right, trust me, I know. No matter how good food is, no place is worth ordering from if they treat you like garbage.  This place does an amazing job of making its customers feel important and valued.\n\nOVERALL:  Delivery was fast and food came hot.  The price is extremely fair for how good the food is.  Customer service is exceptional, though that is not to say there have not been a few bumps in our order history, but they have been resolved straight away.  All food we have ordered has been exceptional and better than what they charge for it. \n\nBOTTOM LINE:  It has something for everyone. The potential to create a GIANT burger will appease the meat lovers.  Vegetarians can love the veggie options (which are ACTUALLY YUMMY!).  Pizza lovers will enjoy the ability to create a delicious pizza that doesn't taste like plastic and NOT break the bank.  Those of you on a diet....you shout STOP dieting and just eat at this place anyway.
4332	0	a	food is decent but the wait time for two slices of pizza is obscene. they need to keep some basic slices pre-made during lunch at least, because the food is not so great to be worth a 20 minute wait. menu is varied but I feel like they might be overextending themselves at the expense of the quality of service.
4333	1	a	Punctual and knowledgable. I was pretty picky and she found me the perfect condo at sky. She even got the price down. If I ever decide to leave this beautiful condo Leah will be the first person I call to find a new spot!
4334	0	a	I went there for lunch with a friend. We have tried most all-you-can eat sushi places in Waterloo so our judgement is pretty accurate.\n\nThe sushi rolls had too much rice on them. This made every roll taste the same and you end up getting full on rice! The tempura and fried foods (dumplings, spring roll) were all pretty oily. The teriyaki dishes were okay, but nothing too special to order more. Lastly, the buffet didn't seem to be very fresh although it had a good variety (we went at around 1pm).\n\nAs for price, it is pretty standard for any AYCE sushi place, and though this place is convenient for UW students I would much rather bus to Ye's.
4335	0	a	Food tastes premade and stored in a fridge. Have eaten at many restaurants in the area and this has got to be one of the few ones I'd never go back to. \n\nThe service is worth the two stars, the food? None.
4336	0	a	Quality isn't really good and it takes a while for them to bring the food to us. There's a buffet bar downstairs to fill you up before the sushi orders arrive lol. The only plus for this place is it's close to UW and has unlimited refill of soft drinks. Other than that I would rather bus to Itamae.
4337	0	a	Worst sushi place I have ever been to, do not go.
4338	0	a	Food quality wasn't very good, the pricing is similar to any other all you can eat maybe even a bit cheaper. Not that it matters much but decorating and food presentation was also lower than sushi restaurants around. \n\nTake home message food quality was below average. I won't be returning to eat here.
4339	0	a	Not sure what I expected, its an ayce sushi place at a extremely low price. And although normally I'm all for a great deal, I left here indifferent. The quality of the sushi is passable. Quality of items vary dish to dish, from 'yeah that totally tastes like what I expected' to 'poop scented tentacles'. Your are sure to find an item you like and more that you don't. But somewhere in between the sketchy budget decor, mushy udon, or rainbow ice cream something felt very wrong. But I am rather biased. I have grown less and less fond of ayce sushi for many of the reasons which are core to Green Sushi. \n\nStuff your face with budget sushi, leave with a lifetime of regret.
4340	0	a	"I ordered via Grubhub this evening: \n1 Tiramisu  and I received Cheesecake- no fruit topping and not note why they sent Cheesecake\n\n1 Traditional White Crust Pizza [10\"" Small Pizza, Tomato Sauce, [Fresh Mozzarella Cheese, Mushrooms, Baby Spinach]]   and I received a dry bland pizza crust with mushroom, spinach and melted cheese- no tomato sauce, is this really pizza?\n\n1 Broccoli Puffs- these were a bit tough & chewey, but the filling was good.\n\nNeedless to day if you can't get 2 of the 3 menu items correct there is an issue."

4342	1	a	The food was amazing! I had the taco combination plate, chicken and Carne asada were perfect!  My husband had the machete and it was delicious!  I will definitely be ordering the machete every time we come back! You have to come try this place!
4343	1	a	"My first mattress as a \""grown adult\"" (as in I purchased myself and not my parents) was a Heavenly Bed from the Starwood brand hotels (the Westin Heavenly Bed). It certainly was heavenly and we kept that mattress for about 9 years!  But as time went on, the mattress got old from wear and tear and a few accidents made by our son and our puppy back in the days.  We had shopped for a mattress for quite some time, but the ones we wanted were so dang expensive - so we kept holding off and tried to justify it by saying, well the mattress is still sleep-able.  But in reality, it wasn't.  It was getting lumpy - our (hubs and I) backs were beginning to hurt from sleeping on it and it just, well, wasn't heavenly anymore.  \n\nWe continued to shop around and decided to take our chance with Tuft & Needle.  A \""local\"" company that seemed to take pride in their product.  The best part was that it wasn't cleaning out our bank!  We decided to give it a shot.  When the hubs brought the box home, I admit, I was a little concerned.  It came in a LONG rectangle box.  My first thought was, uhhh is this a futon type of mattress?  Because that's certainly not what I saw on their website.  How does a THICK, SQUARE mattress fit in a long rectangle one?  When we opened the box up, my worst fears came about, IT IS a futon type mattress!  It was rolled up!  What the heck, right? \n\nHubs said just to lay it out and we'll see how it looks.  To my surprise, as we continued to unroll the mattress and place it on our box-spring, the mattress rose to 10-inches as advertised.  \n\nTo make this long review short - it's been about 3 months now and we could not be happier with our decision.  The mattress is soft yet firm.  It's comfortable.  It's cozy and we've never slept better.  So long are our days of purchasing super expensive brand name mattresses.  Moving forward, we're purchasing here for all our future mattress needs.  AND, they have a 7-year warranty!!"
4344	1	a	I went in to take a look at their ten inch bed. I didn't have an appointment but everyone was very nice! They answered all the questions I had. The office space itself is also pretty sweet! I also really like the story of how the company came to be. Check them out if you are in the market for a new bed!
4345	0	a	Not impressed.   If you are going to charge $4.00 more for the brisket,  it should be very apparent on the menu not buried in fine print at the top of menu.  Which because of the low lighting at night was impossible to read.   Brisket-- I have had a lot better,  not worth the extra $4.00.    Not sure what other meats other than the pulled pork were available on the Cotswald Plate.   Mac& Cheese -- gritty.   The homemade house chips were almost burnt.   Cornbread Fritters???   It was almost like a cookie  -- no taste -  certainly not like you would expect for Cornbread.  Service-- our waitress was snippy and almost rude.   Greens - OK again I have had a lot better.  Slaw again just OK.
4346	1	a	Wow, was really surprised by the earlier review and stolen property.  We stayed in 2 suites the week of 3-17 for Spring Training.  We had an excellent stay and found the staff terrifice, rooms clean, and beds very comfortable.  Our stay well exceeded my expectations.
4347	1	a	Vinny is a real professional. Super-clean, and he has a light touch. He really brought my idea to life. I will always enjoy the tattoo with my niece's name.  He's a talented artist.  I won't go to anyone else.
4348	1	a	Vinny is the ONLY tattoo artist that will do any work on me.  I have watched him be meticulous on keeping the whole experience amazing. From the time and thought spent on the artwork, listening to what you want, and explaining how to achieve it for lasting and best results, to how he is dedicated in keeping all aspects of the tattooing hygienic.  His attention to every detail, his incredible personality and  wit, make the time fly.  I get compliments all the time on his work..even from other tattoo artists.  I have 4 tats by Vinny, and already have 2 more planned..Dang just talking about this makes me want to get another right now!!  Vinny is the best..HANDS DOWN!
4349	0	a	It is trendy and the music is good, but I found the menu to be limited and overpriced. It is okay, but I have had better sushi at two-thirds the price.
4350	1	a	Wow! I ordered the chicken boti and it was so delicious! I had planned on taking my food home but wanted to try a quick bite when I got into the car... well, I ate the whole thing in the parking lot (I'm not proud). It was so tasty! My birthday is next week and now I know where my husband will be taking me for dinner :)
4351	0	a	Very disappointing. One of the worst meals I've ever had and I'm usually pretty forgiving. My friend and I came expecting to have Indian food. Apparently they only serve that on weekends (???) so we had questionable Mediterranean food instead. My veggie panini was almost inedible. The chicken and hummus my friend had were just ok. Service was pretty bad too. I understand they just opened and figuring things out and I could see they mean well but still... I was embarrassed that I took my friend here. This place has potential but they need to train the staff and have a complete/revamped menu.
4352	1	a	Tried it for the first time with my wife.  The chili chicken was spicy & delicious.\nThe lamb shwarma was tender & very tasty.  All entrees come with salad, basmati rice and flat bread.  The d\u00e9cor was very nice as well.  I also liked the fact that you\norder at the counter and the food is brought out to you.\nLooking forward to going back and trying some of the\nother dishes.
4353	0	a	"Very disappointed with their food. Restaurant is very nice and beautiful but people are paying money for the food. The taste is not good and the menu is very confusing. You can eat better tasting food\u00a0at home. They should have less items but the quality, quantity and taste should be very good. Since we don't have that many good halal restaurant in Las Vegas. I wish them all the best and i hope their food gets better.\u00a0\"" Read less"
4354	1	a	The food was very good and I would definitely eat here again! I was happy with what I got for the money. The d\u00e9cor is all over the place but has a certain charm, and the staff was very friendly. The way they serve the food is odd. Those red baskets you usually see at burger joints or diners do not suit this restaurant.
4355	0	a	This one seems a bit more crowded than the location on Eastern, but that also means the selection is quite large. It's often impossible to find the same item in a variety of sizes, so good luck! It's pick and choose. If you're lucky you can find some great deals on items to update your wardrobe with. I haven't spent enough time in this one or had any luck finding any clothing in this location, but I'll give them another shot. Navigating the racks can be awkward because they're so cramped together and the signs aren't always easy to find. \n\nThe traffic around the shopping center can get fairly congested at certain times throughout the day, so it can be a little harrowing trying to leave the parking lot. Lots of security guards making their presence known here when I went.
4356	0	a	As an avid Ross shopper, I am willing to try just about any store. This location isn't one of the better ones. They are large and have a lot of inventory, but the downside is that it's not particularly well-kept or organized. There are always lots of things laying on the floor. I wasn't particularly impressed with the customer service either. I bought quite a few pieces of clothing as as the cashier was putting them in the bag she just balled each of the pieces up and stuff it in the bag.
4357	0	a	I had a lunch buffet today, food is average taste. Nothing special or surprise items.common Indian buffet, interior looks good.Poor customer service.
4358	0	a	We went for New year' s and they cheated us, all our invoices had extra amounts which they refused to credit back. Food was of substandard quality and lousy service.
4359	1	a	Super friendly staff!  They make beginners feel welcome and get you centered before your big day!
4360	1	a	Love this studio! So cozy and always feels like I'm at home. I'm so excited for the 40 day challenge! Such amazing energy comes from everyone here!
4361	0	a	Hours say their open til 10, walked there at 8:30 and the owner locked the door and just stared at us through the front window.\n\nWe tried to eat there Saturday too and they closed until midnight when their hours claim they're are supposed to be consistently open until 3 am.\n\nI was so excited to try the veggie burger but it's looking like the owner doesn't even want our business.
4362	1	a	"It's like a Farmers Market on steroids.\n\nTons of food vendors and people hawking their homemade goods and crafts. I have to be honest and I wasn't able to try most of things here, but I did partake in the \""Green Juice Bar\"", \""JoJo's Jerky\"", and the fresh squeezed lemonade stand. \n\nThe juice was very good and gave me that much needed boost of energy when there was no coffee to be found, even though it was a little pricey. JoJo's Jerky was delicious as per usual, and you can't go wrong with fresh strawberry lemonade made right in front of you.\n\nThen there was the pie eating contest. An insanity laiden event with fifteen people eating blackberry pie with no hands, faces only. It was really quite a scene. Why enter this crazy pie eating situation, how about for a $100 cash prize. Yup, and the reigning champ ended up winning, 3 years strong. One whole pie in under 20 minutes. \n\nGreat stuff for the both foodie and and craft lover inside of you."
4363	0	a	Terrible food and drinks. Cool restaurant layout. Service staff and managers were attentive. \n\nIt was packed for First Friday, which was opening night. Bad decision. The manager who stopped by admitted he had not yet tasted the food or drinks. One more indicator of why everything was so poorly executed.\n\nThe craft beer selection is unfamiliar but mediocre. The mixed drinks were all made in batches, according to staff, and tasted watered down. All were terrible.    \n                                                     \nThe appetizer menu has 3 chips & dip options including salsa, guacamole and queso. The chips were chewy, as if they were either not cooked enough or they were stale. The salsa, queso and guacamole were all lacking in flavor. The queso looked and tasted like potato soup.\n\nThey have 5 tacos on the menu. The carne asada and carnitas were very dry and flavorless. Temperature was between luke warm and cold. The cactus was unique, had a mild grilled flavor but was only so-so. The calamari tasted overly breaded and overly fried. The chicken was flavorless, as if frozen chicken had been reheated and some sauce had been thrown over it at the last minute.\n\nService staff and managers seemed to care, visited us on many occasions and ultimately comped our meal. They asked us to come back and we will. I will gladly update this review if food quality improves. I hope it does.
4364	1	a	If I were rating my first friday experience I would have to say 3/5, but thankfully I made the choice to go back this evening and I was pleased to see that the enthusiastic staff made many changes that makes Paz a 5/5 experience for sure! \n\nWith the removal of the chaos that comes with opening night that was only compounded by first Friday and a live band, the team at Paz was attentive and the quality of my food and drinks skyrocketed! They defiantly took the critiques from Friday to heart and turned this place into one of my fave new spots. \n\nI highly recommend giving this place a shot (or a second chance).  I can't wait to see what they do as they grow, considering what they did in 21 days from concept to opening day these guys definitely have the talent to succeed. \n\nP.S. Love the gallery feel with the local art and I highly recommend the queso with a little bit of their bomb salsa verde mixed in, YUM!
4365	1	a	Great food, amazing drinks and an even better atmosphere, the ping pong tables aren't bad either
4366	0	a	I went here on first Friday and have to say it was some of the worst service I've ever received. We waited 30 minutes for a table because the hostess thought we no longer wanted to sit down and eat. The manager walked by and quickly got us seated, but once seated we waited another 10 minutes when a person in our party had to ask the waiter for water and menus. Then another 20 minutes for them to take our order to which we never received napkins until asked. The food was awful, dry, and bland we had the carnitas, carne asada, and calamari tacos. The only thing that came out somewhat edible was the calamari. We will not be returning to this restaurant.
4367	1	a	I had a $3.50 steak taco and it was terrific! \nEqually I have had the chicken taco and it was also fantastic. \nExcellent patio with a nice view of Roosevelt Row with a great mix of fun tropical music. \nSeriously, chips and salsa and a $3.50 taco, how can you beat that!?!?\nI love it. \n\nSide Note: at the beginning they did have an issue with the chips not being crisp, that issue has since been resolved.
4368	1	a	I visited PAZ last night for a little Taco Tuesday.  The tacos were very good!  I ventured out and tried a cactus taco which is something I've never had before, great for vegetarians!  The hand squeezed house margaritas are a fantastic deal....and a little stronger than they taste.\n\nThe layout of the restaurant is great and I liked effort to display and support local artists.  \n\nI'll definitely be back!
4369	1	a	Stopped in for some food and drink with friends tonight and Paz was awesome.. Stand outs were the Pork Belly Tacos (omg, yum) and a drink called 'Dangerous Liason.' Service was fantastic and everyone was SO friendly.. Patio is dog friendly, prices are really reasonable and it's going on our short list of spots to hang out at in downtown Phoenix.. Great evening, guys - Thanks so much!!!
4370	1	a	The atmosphere is extremely welcoming and the music sets a great mood. The food was great and the staff was very friendly! It's awesome to have a good Mexican food place close to work.\n\nI'll be back!
4371	1	a	Great space. Just opened and adding new items to the already great taco menu. We will continue to check back.
4372	1	a	I came here last night with my boyfriend to meet up with a couple of friends and I was really really impressed with the place.  Not only do they have an inviting atmosphere with plenty of indoor and outdoor seating but their food is as good, if not better than what I had heard.  \n\nThe interior has a casual ambiance with local artists' paintings as decor.  An open kitchen, so that you can see your food being prepared and a friendly staff to boot.\n\nUpon sitting down you get a basket of their housemade tortilla chips and salsa (also made in house).  Make sure to ask for the spicy salsa too....you won't regret it (although, I thought it could be a little spicier).  \n\nThe menu is simple but filled with flavorful options.  I was torn between the quinoa vegan salad or the cactus tacos.  I chose the cactus tacos but did it without cheese.  I couldn't believe the flavor inside those little corn tortillas (which had a ton of flavor themselves).  They come small, so I recommend getting a few of them to start.\n\nMy boyfriend got the steak, pork belly, and chicken tacos.  I pretty much think he was in heaven.  He said his favorite was the pork belly and the steak.\n\nWe will definitely be back to try the quinoa salad and also because I heard they were going to be opening for brunch soon and I love my brunch...especially mimosas!   \n\nAll in all, you'd be doing yourself a favor to coming to Paz...can't wait to see what is to come!
4373	1	a	This place just opened up and we wanted to give it a try.  Everything from the service, the apps, drinks, and the food was awesome.  Everything was fresh the tacos were amazing.  Really authentic street tacos. Try the pork belly!!!
4374	1	a	Ridiculously good tacos!! Tried them all and the cactus and pork belly are unique and amazing. The tortillas are homemade and delicious. Im picky but I would say it's safe to say these are the best tacos in Phoenix.
4375	1	a	Micheladas on point! Tinga tacos are by far my favorite. Staff was attentive & they let us vape :) my new spot for sure.
4376	1	a	"I didn't know what to expect from this little place, and made the mistake of ordering a dish -- chilaquiles -- that I thought I knew. Paz made it differently than I was used to, and I was disappointed. On the positive side, when I told our server that I didn't think the food had any taste, one of the chefs came out to talk to us. Michael was very sweet and we discussed just how variable \""Mexican\"" food can be, in that every region makes their stuff differently. We got to talking and he told us about his favorite item, the pork belly. It sounded so good: slow roasted for 15 hours using Filipino style seasoning. He brought us a generous sample out to try, and it was WONDERFUL!\n\nI will definitely go back for the pork.\n\nOther positives: the menu is limited because they want everything to be as fresh as possible. You could definitely tats that in the salsa, which was fresh and bursting with green chili goodness.\n\nMy beloved got a breakfast burrito that was tasty.\n\nI'll be back, and you should try it out."
4377	1	a	just stopped in for lunch. was able to get in and out and back to work in time. wasn't too busy. there were two servers working and helping each other out. both were super friendly. I ordered three tacos - fish, carnitas and pork belly. Here is my rating based on five stars: Fish - four stars. nice chunk of lightly breaded/fried ... the sweet/sour pink purple slaw thing on top really added to the flavor. Carnitas - 4 stars. really tasty. They use a crispy pork versus the usual pulled pork. I think I prefer the usual, but it was still good. The best for last - Pork Belly - five stars. I could have eaten 5 of them...perfectly crisp on outside, delicious evil fatty layer...drooling. Figured since I had an hour lunch, I could treat myself to a cocktail too. You cant beat a $3 house margarita! I will definitely be back.
4378	0	a	No..all around NO. \n\nI gave Paz Cantina a try the other night given the reviews here. \n\nFood = mediocre/not traditional nor authentic\nDrinks = bad\nService = decent\n\nStreet taco's and guacamole were abysmal and the michelada's were horrid.\n\nI won't be back
4379	0	a	"Four of us just  finished eating. A few things here include \""love\"" as an ingredient.  I'm pretty sure the rest are made with a healthy dose of dispair. I asked each one of my compatriots how they would describe the meal on one word:  disgusting, dirty, bland,  and sad. We ordered margaritas; I think they forgot the tequila.  We also got the carnitas, fish, pork belly, carne asada tacos and chips and guac.  The tacos were miserable. The fish, pork belly, and carnitas tacos were super bland; which  itself is somewhat impressive. The worst of the lot was the carne asada which had the texture of chewed gum and the flavor of silly putty rolled in the ashtray of an chain-smoker. The guac was good though : nice and fresh."
4380	1	a	This building is known for its poor luck with businesses staying open, but it's looking like Paz will stand a chance.\n\nI was lured over by the $3 margarita and looking to wind down after seeing a movie at Film Bar. The margarita was excellent! Definitely worth the $3 and then some. My husband and I split the nachos and were unable to make much of a dent in them though not for lack of trying. I recommend sharing among 3 or 4 people. The place was PACKED so service was on the slower side. Still, our wonderful waiter was sure to stop by and update us on wait times for our food and drinks.\n\nOn the night we went there was a great DJ and a small dance floor. While we weren't able to hold much of a conversation with the noise level that high, watching the couples dance was a lot of fun.
4381	1	a	Wow. It is like amazing happened in your mouth. I would eat this multiple times a day, friendly staff, and great environment.
4382	1	a	The pork belly taco is delicious! \nCome to think of it,  I haven't had a bad meal here. It's not inexpensive but definitely worth it. \nTeneia was excellent. \nI'll be back.
4383	1	a	Absolutely love this place. Their taco Tuesday deals are awesome for the quality food you receive. I personally dig the pork belly and the tinga (chicken) tacos. I've even had a special order of pork belly tacos with the tinga toppings...which might just be my favorite. It doesn't hurt that this place is walking distance from my apartment, either! I will definitely keep returning for this amazing food and atmosphere, and I can't wait to try a weekend brunch.
4384	1	a	Heather is amazing!!  She has been my hair stylist for 5 years and she is the only one I trust with my hair!  She did my hair and make up for my wedding as well as my whole wedding party.  She has done my sisters hair and makeup for prom and has done my mom and sisters hair for 5 years also!
4385	1	a	This review is for the  pre-opening of Red Robin in Downtown Summerlin. The atmosphere is quite cheerful. There are several dining spaces which are very brightly lit and have colorful designs. \nThe wait staff was extremely helpful, very knowledgeable of the menu and friendly. Although the restaurant was packed service was timely.\nThe Pretzel Bite appetizer was a great starter. The pretzels were warm and soft. The beer cheese dipping sauce was the perfect paring.\nThe DGB Burger consisted a a juicy beef patty with roasted tomatoes, garlic aioli and arugula on a toasted  ciabatta bun. \nThe Gourmet Cheeseburger was cooked just as ordered and included melted American cheese, tomatoes, lettuce, onions, pickles and mayo. \nThe battered  Artic Cod Fish was crispy and fried to perfection. It is served with a tasty dill and pickled tartar sauce. \nThe burgers and fish entree all come with the bottomless steak fries that were not the bit greasy and delicious.\nLooks like this place is ready for it's Grand Opening
4386	0	a	HORRIBLE SERVICE! Waited for a half hour didn't get our appetizer, while everyone who was seated after us was served.  The server didn't even get our order until 15-20 mins of being seated. I get its a new restaurant but it shouldn't take that long for our appetizer to get to the table. The manager had to go to the kitchen and get our food that was probably just sitting there. Then when we got our food the waitress came over and said she forgot our onion rings. So upset with the dining experience. Food was alright but still didn't need to take over an hour to get everything to our table. Thought this was a burger place?
4387	0	a	This is one of my favorite places but man is it because they just opened but the service sucks! We were seated right away then drinks orders were taken. After 10 mins of no drinks we walked to the bar to get our own water.  Manager did come to our table to acknowledge delay in drinks and offered a free appetizer. That was nice.when our order arrived they got it wrong. We ordered a chicken sandwich and got a burger instead. Waited 5 more minutes for correct order to arrive. Them the table next to us waited a long time for their drinks as well. They are way over staffed and can't get things done. I hope it's just because they just opened and are super busy. Let's see..I might give them another try in a month or so.
4388	1	a	I enjoyed my dinner at Red Robin for the most part. This location is definitely smaller than others, or maybe it just feels cramped because the tables are all very close together. I was seated in the front room & luckily I came when it wasn't very busy, but every time someone opened the door I was freezing. Also, I constantly needed a refill! The food was pretty good, and the service was definitely above average but they were obviously extremely overstaffed.
4389	1	a	I like the set up. Staff is friendly. Kind of disappointed with the appetizer size. Got the spinach artichoke dip and it came out in what looked like a sample bowl.The chips were light and delicious and you can tell it's homemade. But the dip was still good. Wish they gave a little more for the price.\nI always get the Banzai Burger but decided to be adventurous and try the French Dip.  It was pretty good. It has great flavor. And i love the taste of horseradish. That is honestly my favorite part. The cole slaw is tangy and delicious. And how could you go wrong with their bottomless fries?!? Yum!
4390	0	a	Appetizers good. Hamburgers bland and buns dry and cold. Server forgot our endless frys. And gave us the wrong check. First time , last time. I don't see what's the attraction.
4391	0	a	It was just ok. The waitress was really nice but forgot my fries. Not tragic, as another waiter brought me some, but they were cold and rubbery. The waitress also forgot my second order of fries, too. No fries for me. Whiskey River Chicken Burger was OK but it wasn't hot, just luke warm. It's a beautiful and lovely restaurant... on the Downtown Summerlin Mall complex but eh food and service. =/. This isn't the typical, great RR experience but they just opened. I'll try again at a later time. =)
4392	0	a	"Gourmet Burgers? Not even close! I would recommend Fat Burger and In & Out Burger before I would recommend Red Robin.\n\nWe ordered the \""Big Whiskey\"" and the \""Black & Blue\"".\n\nI have not eaten a Whopper since I was a kid, but after trying the BW, I now remember what a Whopper taste like. Seriously, I thought I was at Burger King. The only difference was the $12 that Red Robin charges you for the burger. Then I was offered the option of parmesan fries for an additional .99 cents. I was served old fries that were cold and broken in small pieces.\n\nThe Black & Blue was good. It was made with Black Angus Beef, mushrooms, and blue cheese. It was served on a ciabatta bun.\n\nThe service was good. We were greeted by a hostess upon our arrival and she also asked us how everything was before we departed. The server did a fine job and a woman that appeared to be a manager stopped by our table to say hello. The server brought us fresh fries after I brought the old fries to her attention, so I did not bring it to the managers attention. The cooks should not have sent the fries to the table though. Also, when I asked the server if the meat they used for the Big Whiskey burger was USDA Choice, she said she would ask the kitchen staff. Upon her return I was notified that there was not anyone in the restaurant that could answer my question.\n\nSummary:\n$37 for two small burgers, two drinks, and two sides of fries.\n\nI do not recommend Red Robin as place to go for burgers."
4393	1	a	Great experience. My first visit ever to this chain. Yummy burger, super friendly service.
4394	0	a	I don't know if all Red Robins are the same but this new location is nothing but a glorified Chucky Cheese. Lots of kids and bad food. I ordered a clam chowder, it was so watered down and yet the chef still serves it. The other dishes we had seemed thrown together as though nobody cared. Didn't feel the love at this restaurant , I will not be going back.
4395	1	a	I'm a fan; I had a pleasant experience! I even had me some of those bottomless steak fries I kept hearing about. Now that I think about it, I may have had every type of fry they offered... And some onion rings. \n\nThe bottomless rootbeer float is a good choice of beverage. My choice of a gourmet burger was the Sauteed 'Shroom which I thoroughly enjoyed. Whenever there's a mushroom and swiss on the menu, I always make sure to try it. And let me tell you, there was an abundance of mushrooms in my burger. I'd say there were about three fistfuls! I am not exaggerating.\n\nThe reviews here, so far, are pretty mixed, but I'd have to say that my experience resulted in a good meal. My server was lovely and accommodating. My friends and I were content, so I'm glad to have a Red Robin closer to my neck of the woods.
4396	0	a	"I've been to the RR at the Galleria Mall and it was great, so I was excited that one opened up at Downtown Summerlin. I hate to write a bad review, but the only thing good about our trip to this Red Robin was the service. The \""onion dip and chips\"" appetizer was awful. The dip was soupy and the chips were soggy...I'm guessing there was a problem with the fryer because the fries were soft and soggy and the onion straws in my chicken burger were slithery and not crispy at all. The server did her best to make it up to us, and even brought the cronuts to us free as a desert...but they were uncooked in the middle too. I heard several other people send back fried things because they weren't cooked. The burger itself was under seasoned and quite bland. Red Robin better rethink the \""gourmet burgers\"" sign on the building. With so many awesome little places in town to find actual \""gourmet\"" burgers, I doubt we'll be back to Red Robin any time soon."
4397	0	a	Service was just ok. The waiter spilled my beer on the table, wiped it up and left the pile of wet napkins at the edge of our table and didn't bring us our water glasses till we were already eating.  My chicken sandwich was fine.  My husband had a regular cheeseburger and they wouldn't cook it medium rare, only medium or well done. We also had the mozz sticks/fried zucchini as apps and it upset our stomaches, even my two year old had a tummy ache. \n\nI wouldn't go back.
4398	1	a	Just returned home after another fabulous cut and colour by Sheryl!  I have extremely thick, course hair and no one can cut and take the  weight out like her.  I highly recommend her expertise in colouring, cut and style.  I have been following her for years and always rely on her recommendations.
4399	1	a	Great arena for hockey, concerts, and so many other events. Friendly staff, clean restrooms, and a great location for events. Love coming here to watch hockey games--Let's Go Coyotes!
4400	0	a	Getting out of the Upper Deck after a Hockey game will be your first nightmare if your seats are there. Only two escalators lead down and out and the wait can be up to 20 minutes for the thousands of cheapskates. If you survive that wait then good luck exiting the shopping center parking lot. It looks like Black Friday shopping day out there. The wait to get out might have taken an hour, but luckily I entered a nearby bar and drank away the long line of brake lights. Inside the arena is a pretty good view from the Upper Deck, but didn't bother trying any food. Get VIP or figure out some way to avoid the mass crowds and it would be a better experience.
4401	0	a	Going to see Trans Siberian Orchestra and had to wait forever to get in. Horrible organization and planning. It is already 30 minutes past start time.
4402	0	a	"The facility is great.  The pools are outstanding.  Glad to see the Tennis courts too.  But why do you join a health club?  For the gym!  The gym floor sucks.  Great equipment, but it's all jammed up and tight.  \""Sorry if my elbow hits you in the face\"" kind of tight.  How about cutting out one basketball court and give us some space to actually work out?  It's basically a day care center with a gym thrown in."
4403	0	a	Wonderful facility & the staff were helpful...my issue... The cost!!!   When a gym membership costs double my car payment ..all I can say is no thank you!  \n\n\nI go to the gym to work out, not to be hang out and use it as a social status.
4404	1	a	If you get past the price and look at what lifetime has to offer you will not be disappointed.  It's more of a country club feel then a gym.  It's geared for families, our kids love it just as much as we do. \nThe service is top notch- you  really get what you pay for.
4405	0	a	"The facilities are great, but the spin classes are not good. There are only two spin classes offered in the evenings, one on Tues and one on Thurs.  Dallas, who is in charge of group classes, teaches the Thurs and her idea of motivating her participants is to SCREAM \""Push\"", \""Push it!\"" every 6 seconds. It's the worst spin class I've ever taken in my life and I've taken spin for 15 years. She throws in a few \""woo hoo\"" at the top of her lungs too, all this while being microphoned. She's like a caricature of a class instructor that you would see on an SNL skit from the 80's. For the amount of money I pay for this gym, I expect quality instructors who know how to motivate a class in ways other than screaming the same word over and over for 60 minutes.  There were also no jumps, spinning was not on beat, just up hill and downhill. \n\nThe class seats 50 and there were less than ten people in the class which shows you how bad it is. I hope the Tues spin instructor is better and I hope they add more spin classes without Dallas teaching them.\n\nI would give the gym one star, but the equipment is nice, facilities are clean, and employees are nice. I just want better and more spin classes."
4406	1	a	Great place!!! Great ambience and service.  Good food. Will definitely come back. Inferno quinoa salad is great!!!!!
4407	1	a	This second incarnation is terrific.  We love the original, but the new place has an open, bright atmosphere that is comfortable and inviting.  The food is the same great quality as the original, and the service is great and the location is very convenient for those of us in North Scottsdale.  You just can't beat a Boss after work.  If you don't know what that means, come by for Happy Hour!
4408	0	a	went there last sunday. place was busy but not full.got served chips, salsa and water immediately. never got our drink or food order taken for the 30 minutes we were there. got up and told the manager but all he was interested in was what table we were seated at. the three of us walked out. scottsdale location is great but won't return to pima road location.
4409	0	a	Very average Mexican food. Glasses and utensils wrre, in some cases, dirty. We sat outside and asked for the heater but didn't get it... It sat there unused. Someone else asked for it and also didn't get it...but then another party asked for it and got it! The manager came by asked how everything was and got an earful but appeared to ignore it. Food was not offensive but nothing special either.
4410	0	a	Not a fan.  Brought friends from Canada to the DC Ranch Market Place location for dinner a few weeks ago.  No one in our group of 9 thought is was very good and some where annoyed we wasted dinner at this place in lieu of all the great restaurants available in the area.  We had dinner on the inside balcony.  No tablecloths or nice looking tables, plastic cafeteria or pizza joint cups...go elsewhere for Mexican!!!
4411	0	a	Waitress was great although everyone seemed overwhelmed ...maybe Bc it's fairly new to open \nThe guacamole was excellent other than that everything we ordered was completely over salted :( our family of 6 couldn't finish anything they ordered Bc of all the salt .... Even the chicken and rice soup \nWouldn't return :( thankfully we had a gift card so we only had to pay 80 dollars for food no one ate
4412	0	a	We arrived during happy hour, were greeted by one of the managers.  The table we wanted to sit at (no one else was in the restaurant) was dirty. The manager told us to sit wherever we wanted, tossed the menus on the adjacent table and walked off like a spoiled teenager whose phone had been taken away. The servers were nice and seemed overly accommodating, after I expressed my displeasure with the manager, however, the first impression was set. I'm sure the manager was having a rough day, but his attitude was quite off putting. This was our first visit and probably our last.
4413	1	a	This is our 2nd time here in a week. Food and service was great. Happy they're open late on a Sunday. Again, so happy that we don't have to drive to China Town. We had pot stickers, shrimp rolls, two bowls of pho, and it was only $27.
4414	1	a	North Las Vegas is stepping it up with a few new restaurants and this is one worth writing about.  There are really NO legit pho restaurants in North Las Vegas, so I would say this a great addition to the area.  The next closest spot would be Viet Bistro but even that is a little further away.\n\nSo onto the food, we tried the pork egg rolls, combo pho, and charbroiled pork vermicelli bowl.  The pork egg rolls are definitely not as good as Viet Bistro, but a whole lot cheaper.  You really can't beat 4 large eggrolls for $4.95.  They weren't my favorite due to a strange salty/sour flavor.  I'll probably give them one more go, in hopes that it was an off batch.  The combo pho really hit the spot for me...it had rare steak/meatballs/tendon/tripe...all the good stuff.  The flavor of the broth is a tad bit on the sweet side but still very savory.  For $8 a bowl, the price is definitely right for the quantity.  The charbroiled pork vermicelli bowl was very tasty, but a little skimpy on the pork in my opinion compared to other locations.  Also,  I wish they offered chicken as an option instead of just beef and pork.   And where is my favorite bun bo hue....that would really make this place legit...but prob scare the non-Asian folks in this area.\n\nBased on my observations of the staff, they are Cantonese and Vietnamese (since they speak both languages).  They also have some other Asian offerings (like stir fried noodles, curry, pad thai)....not sure if I'll venture into ordering non-Viet or Cantonese items offered.  The restaurant is fairly large and clean...for now.  Good fro groups and they were showing football games on Sunday.  Definitely will be back for a nice hot bowl of pho in the wintertime!  Hope they last in this location, it's a needed addition to the restaurants up North.
4415	1	a	First time here and really loved the genuine  flavors, the price, and the atmosphere! Will be back pho more.
4416	1	a	"The food was very fresh and pretty tasty.  The restaurant is very clean and the service is prompt and courteous.  I like that there is a Pho restaurant on this side of town and we don't have to drive to Chinatown to enjoy a decent meal. The prices are very reasonable which gives you the opportunity to enjoy more items from the menu.  This will now my \""go to\"" Pho restaurant."
4417	0	a	"I went to this restaurant three separate times, each time ordering the rare steak pho, and each time the service was horrible. I have never been to a \""restaurant\"" with such inattentive staff before in my life. There is a sign at the door that says please wait to be seated, and if you follow the sign you probably will never eat. Each time I went to this place I had to seat my self. The first time I went here the food was pretty tasty, but the service was not very good. The waitress actually came over while I was on my phone and just grabbed my bowl while I was still eating. I mean all she had to do was ask. The Thai milk tea is tasty, but they fill up those cups with so much ice that you barely get anything.\n\nSecond time I came here I took my mother, we ended up sitting ourselves and I grabbed menus. By the time we were ready to order three separate groups entered and sat themselves. We waited for the waitress to take our order but what she did was go and take everyone elses order first! strike one. I do not know if it was a race thing or what, because she went over to the table seating an asian family, who came in the restaurant more than ten minutes after us, and took their order first. Then she went to each table that was seated much after ours before finally taking our order. My mother was very irked at the sight of this, I had to reassure her it is no big deal, even though it is extremely rude. The gentle man who works there brought all the other tables their veggies, bean sprouts, lime, peppers, branch ,etc, before our table got anything. Its funny because we did get our food before everyone else but we had no sprouts, or any of that, I had to ask for it. My mother loved the food, enough so that she wanted to go again. The chef was very nice and she did come out and apoligize for the fact that they were understafed, she should have said that the staff was undertrained.\n\nWhat really got to me the second time was that we asked for light ice in our thai tea, the waitress kept saying,\""less ice yes, less ice\"" I kept saying no we want light ice, just a little ice, not too much ice, she repeated,\"" yes, less ice\"" when we got our tea it was filled with ice. This simple thing really got on my bad side. How rude!!\n\nThe third and last time i will ever sit in this place was a couple days ago, I went with my mother and we ordered the same thing as the previous. We actually had to ask for ice on the side so there was no confusion, It was a really bad mistake. The Thai tea with no ice was not layered so it was pretty gross. I think its also because with no ice they put a lot more half and half. When the food came out it was not hot, it was warm but not hot. I ate it anyway, until I just lost my appetite. This is the final time I will ever eat inside this place. Maybe I will get something to go, but never will I set foot in this place to eat ever again. \n\nIts hilarious, the waitress grabbed my mothers bowl without asking, just thinking that she was done, I had to tell her that she was still eating. My mother was irked at the fact that she did that and just told her that she is done now. \n\n\nThis place needs to sell their new Tv's and hire a hostess and new waiting staff. or at least Train their existing staff to be competent. They should also dim the lights, it is not a robertos, so quit acting like it is. I would give this place a one star if it was not for the food being fairly decent.\n\n\nI really wish that this place was replaced with Monta Ramen or something similar."
4418	1	a	Convenient, cheap, if a bit eccentric. The egg rolls are nothing to write home about, the pho, even plain, is excellent. I thoroughly enjoyed my sliced beef dish, but it was a bit slim on meat portion, not a bad deal given the price.Their bun needed a little more roasted garlic flourish but its almost there. The nuoc mam could stand to be a bit stronger but I guess they want to maximize their potential customer base; personally I have no problems passing for a fish market after some excellent Vietnamese. Have yet to try the Chinese dishes on the menu but they do look mighty appetizing. Service is still getting sorted out but its not bad, just a work in progress. Later hours on weekends as well as offering broken rice would be nice.
4419	1	a	Excellent broth, good food, exceedingly clean restaurant, and a nice owner - we will definitely be returning!
4420	1	a	Good barber, friendly service, clean shop. Costs a couple of dollars more than the chains, but worth it for the quality and straight edge blade finish. I was also happy they take American Express and all cards through Square.
4421	0	a	"Our first dining experience will unfortunately be our last!  We arrived at 5:25pm, seated, & then the experience went downhill!  We ordered an order of garlic rolls & it took 30 min with our waiter, Mike checking 3 times to see if they were ready!  We ordered 2 - 14\"" pizzas & a calzone & it took over an hr to get them, again with Mike checking more than once.  When my husband asked Mike if there was a reason why it was taking so long, Mike's reply was that it was the first week they were opened & that we should have come earlier than 6:00pm.  When my husband said we got there before 5:30, Mike shrugged his shoulders & said \""well maybe you shouldn't come back!\""  We have never had a server speak to either one of us like that & that only makes us feel like our business is really not warranted or that important!  Coming from NY where restaurants are always super busy & having worked in the restaurant industry, this kind of treatment & speed of service are two things that will quickly make one's business a goner, something a business in today's economy really has to be so careful of!  Totally a thumb's down experience & a waste of a Saturday night!"
4422	1	a	Went there for lunch today. Everything about it was great! We had sausage and peppers app, wings and capo pizza. We sat at the bar. Drinks were good. Service was amazing! I will be back! So happy to see such a good local place!
4423	0	a	They need to train the cooks!  Nothing is cooked.  Pizza is chewy and The dough is not cooked enough. We tried a calzone tonight same thing rubbery dough just terrible!
4424	1	a	Great pizza, great service. I will be here again for sure. Great local spot. Prices were great considering how fresh the ingredients were. Super excited they carry my favorite beer Sierra Nevada too.
4425	1	a	So happy for a new restaurant in my neck of the woods!  Even better that it is good...\n\nThis place just opened in the Bashas shopping center on the corner of Gilbert rd. and Chandler Hts.  Not much out this way- so we end up hitting germann and gilbert.  \n\nWe ordered the garlic rotolis- which are kind of like garlic knots but bigger and yummier. Followed it with a large pizza with pepperoni (we are a pretty plain group-lol). Gave the chicken wings a try as well and went with the Italian style which is made with roasted onion and garlic.  All the food was delicious :)  The price was pretty much what you would expect...I believe our bill came to $30 bucks.  \n\nThe restaurant is also decorated really well and the bar has I believe two or three tv's which had the games playing.  Seems as though people had already deemed the place to be a good neighborhood spot to sit and watch the games and the bar seats were all full.\n\nEnjoyed and will go back!
4426	0	a	I really wanted to like this place as I've heard and read good things, that's where the good part of the story ends.  When I arrived I watched the pizza being made with all the precision of a machine, perhaps they should use a machine, exactly this much dough; no more, no less, exactly this much cheese; no more, no less, exactly x number pieces of paper thin pepperoni; no more, no less, x number leaves of basil; no more, no less, obviously they are very concerned about the per unit cost, who cares about the taste or look.  The dough was like a cracker no give at the edges overcooked in their 1000 degree coal oven and it was pricey at that.  Staff was pleasant and courteous which doesn't make up for an $18 pizza which weighs like almost nothing when you carry it out.  If I was to buy another, which I will not, I would weigh it when I got home, you sure don't need 2 hands to carry it like large homemade style pizza.  I threw out the leftovers which is a mortal sin for an Italian but I couldn't bare to eat it again.\n\nIf you want a pizza in this area, try Basha's they're not great but they're half the price, and they use a gas fired brick oven.
4427	1	a	The pizza is  bit pricey but excellent, and the garlic knots are super. Staff are pretty good. Service is a little slow but that is probably because it's a new place and really busy plus all new staff . I hope the place continues to provide great food because it's wonderful to have a good restaurant in the area.
4428	1	a	I like the food but it need some help to do with the service. Waitresses are nice but they are too busy to forget things. The manager need to figure out that problem. It lacks of organization.
4429	1	a	Menu was really easy to read, I like the straight-to-the-point options. Donuts had that nice airy bite to them, with the side of some iced coffee, you can't go wrong .
4430	1	a	"Small joint in a developing area, I figured, \""new spot, will have to work out the kinks.\""  No way, first visit was great, I was even \""that guy\"" that walks in 4 minutes before closing (I honestly didn't know the hours SORRY) they did not mind, were jovial and fun to talk to.  \nI ordered the Korean chili chicken, (asian) slaw, with a sprinkles cake donut.  Was highly impressed, the chicken was fried to a nice crisp and it was sauced tossed to perfection as to not goo it up.  The flavor was on point, I frequent Korean chicken joints in LA and this is definitely up to par.  The donut was eaten bit by bit after each mouthful of the chicken followed by slaw each time to clear the palate.  They also were nice enough to throw in an extra donut on my way out, that i am saving for dessert after whatever i scrounge up in my kitchen tonight."
4431	1	a	I decided to come here since it's only 10mins away from school and I have an hour until class starts. We got there at 7am, there was a lady in front of us so I explored the place and took some pictures. The place was cute. I love the artwork on the wall. I thought those frames were touch screens but it's not. The staff was friendly & helpful. I ordered the chocolate + rose + pistachio and the maple bacon was calling my name so I ended up with 2 donuts. Both were good, I expected the bacon to be crispy but it's not. The other donut, it had an aroma of a rose.. Soo good! I will come back and try their chicken.
4432	1	a	I have been waiting and waiting for this place to open because I love a great donut. I stopped in this morning on my way to work and was so excited when I saw the donut case. \n\nDecisions decisions...after standing there for 5 minutes I made my choices. I chose the cajeta sea salt fritter and the chipotle limon cake donut. The fritter was huge and if you like sweet and salty you are going to love this donut. It was so good. I don't normally like a cake donut but this one wasn't dry or overly dense. It had a hint of lemon and the chipotle sugar was sweet and spicy. I loved it! \n\nThe premium donuts are a bit pricey but they are so worth it. Let me just say these donuts are drop on the ground delicious. Yes if I dropped it on the ground I would still eat it!
4433	0	a	I was so excited to try something new! I went inside and the place was really cool. When I got back to work to eat my chicken, it was raw, my chicken was bleeding. I am not sure if it's a mistake or what is going on. The portions are small for what you pay for and I like my chicken cooked. I will never go back I don't even want my money back.
4434	0	a	I went into here this past Friday thinking to myself chicken and donuts how unique is that; makes one think of a LoLo's spinoff. I spent rounded up $9.00 on a chicken thigh and drumstick with a cucumber salad. Not only was it overpriced for those two pieces, but it look as if the chicken was cooked too fast in old oil and not long enough. When I bite into the chicken it had an aftertaste and was pink with a tinge of blood inside. I expected more from an establishment serving food. When I tried to contact them shortly after the blood tinged chicken my call went unanswered after several attempts.
4435	1	a	I have been a fan of Welcome Diner for a while and was very excited to hear they were opening up a new restaurant. Let me tell you that I was not disappointed when I finally got to try them.  Its just a small little restaurant, run by some really nice people. But what they are able to achieve is pretty cool.\n\nBoth my wife and I got the 3 piece chicken and donut. I got the Japanese bbq and she got the Korean Spicy. We ended up trading a piece so both of us could try the other. I was really impressed. Both flavors were really bold and tasty. Cooked to perfection with just the right amount of batter. The slaw that I got as a side was really good as well.\n\nI upgraded my donut to one with blueberry cream cheese icing and it was good. But really for me it was the chicken that stole the show.\n\nGive this place a try. Its small little business like this one, and of course its big brother Welcome Dinner, that help gives Phoenix its flavor.
4436	1	a	Welcome Chicken + Donuts is a much-needed foodie paradise! Not knowing what to expect, I was thinking chicken and donuts would be a take on chicken and waffles -- the flavors and quality of the food were insanely better! This is a place that FOODIES WILL LOVE! (We certainly did!) Don't go here if you are expecting KFC, Waffle House, Dunkin Donuts-type fare. This is not a fast food joint and if that's what you like to eat then you certainly will not be able to appreciate the complexity of delicious flavors this place has to offer. \n\nThe chicken is local, fresh, not full of hormones, and unbleached! Incredibly rare to find eating out! The flavors were incredible -- I liked the Korean Chili the best. The sides to go along with the fried chicken are unique and delicious! And the cake donut on the side was surprisingly-perfect with the food! We even got toddy (cold-brewed coffee) that was tasty and cheap and learned it is locally brewed in Phoenix too! \n\nI'm really excited to try some of the gourmet flavors of donuts that they offer. They look like something out of cupcake bakery that you would find in San Francisco - not something typical for Phoenix at all. This place has no snottie vibe either! Just real people creating epic food with epic quality!\n\nWe'll be bringing my mother-in-law along next time for sure! This place really does have something to offer everyone!
4437	1	a	I have had 3 donuts from Welcome Chicken and Donuts. The extremely flavorful salted caramel bun type thing.... got this around opening day, and it was legitimately tasty. The second time, I tried the blueberry cheesecake and the chocolate cacao. Both were insanely good, even better than the salted caramel. The chocolate cacao had dense white cake donut with dark chocolate icing... so good. The cheesecake blueberry was also delicious... a little savory, a little sweet, and all tasty. I will certainly be back to try more donuts and try the chicken!
4438	1	a	First time here and what an amazing experience!  I didn't realize that everything here was non-GMO and ORGANIC which was a huge a major plus!!!  \n\nI had the Wisconsin cheddar cheese apple fritter and two piece fried chicken with Japanese barbecue sauce.\n\nIt was beyond fantastic. Fried chicken was so crunchy moist and succulent that it pretty much melted in your mouth.  I was hesitant about adding the Japanese barbecue sauce but I am so glad that I did. It is a definite must in my book!\n\nThe donuts were just as equally amazing and oozing with unique creativity freshness and so much taste in each and every bite.  I was torn between the cheddar cheese Wisconsin apple fritter and the banana cream peanut butter pecan, so I did both and loved it.\n\nYou definitely have to try this place!!!
4439	0	a	Got an iced cofee and maple pecan apple fritter. It had a great taste but then the bad part came in, it was extremely greasy making it inedible! Coffees was ok but not that good. Maybe il try their chicken one day. As of now i will go down the street to circle k for coffee and donuts.
4440	1	a	One of the best food combinations is salty and sweet. Welcome Chicken and Donuts does this excellence.  I know that whenever I go here I won't be disappointed. \nHaving grown up sample a fair share of donuts as a family I am well versed in the decadence of donuts.  The great part about the donuts here is the combination of classic donuts like the apple fritter and cake donut but you can also try some of the most unique creations that they offer like key lime and lemon poppyseed to name a couple.  \nWhat goes better with a donut than coffee.  And the coffee does not fail.  There aren't many place around town that offer a cold brew and theirs is dynamite. I love that they offer almond milk as an option. \nThe chicken is spot on.  Just the right amount of crispness and so juicy.  Everyone that works there has been friendly and welcoming.  Indoor seating is limited but there is an awesome patio outside.
4441	1	a	Korean chicken was amazing! Drove past this place on the way to work and had to try it. Not disappointed at all. The maple bacon donut was amazing as well. The line was long but worth the wait.
4442	1	a	When I first discovered chicken and waffles, I had a whole new world of cuisine open up to me. WC+D was not quite that eye opening however.\n\nThe building doesn't look like much from the outside, and even once you come inside it doesn't blow you away. The outside patio is quite nice (and I assume they will be working on the outside of the building a bit more considering they haven't been open for long and still have an ad for the old business on their doors).\n\nHowever, you come here for the food. I ended up getting a dozen wings with korean chili. These wings are not tiny wings like you get at other places, so half a dozen was more than enough for me (but I get dinner for later). The taste was wonderful. It was the right amount of spice and a little sweetness. The green onions were a good addition. However, as most wings are, these are super messy. However, having to lick off the extra sauce at the end was a nice bonus.\n\nI ended up getting a chipotle limon sugar donut. It was okay. It wasn't bad, but it was nothing special. I really wanted to replicate the chicken and waffle taste palette, but screwed up with the sauce wings and non plain donut.
4443	1	a	Chicken (lunch menu) not served until 1030a and it gets busy from then to 1p but may sell out sooner.
4444	0	a	Disappointing.  Unique flavorings of doughnuts that are grossly overpriced and in the end relatively boring.  Nothing impressed me about the donuts, sadly.  I was really hoping for doughnuts that are made to order and really fresh.  The three doughnuts I purchased had been made 8+ hours before.\n\nI came away with an impression of uncleanliness.  Most of the workers or owners had scraggly hair and scruffy beards.  The interior and the servers don't add to the atmosphere. \n\nI am going to stick with Welcome Diner and Rainbow Donuts.
4445	1	a	"Have you ever been rendered speechless by a piece of chicken? If your answer is no, you've been eating the wrong chicken, and you need to get yourself to Chicken + Donuts. \n\nWe came on a Saturday for lunch and each enjoyed a combo of the two piece chicken and a donut, plus a side. We both got Korean chili chicken, I got the balsamic pear donut and my husband got the chocolate pistachio rose donut. I got the cucumber salad side and my husband got the slaw. \n\nIt was ridiculous. \n\nThe chicken was perfectly crispy but surprisingly light and juicy covered in an amazing spicy sweet Korean sauce garnished with scallions, and after I had my first bite, I couldn't talk. You know when you're sitting around the table with your family and your mom made your favorite dish and somebody goes, \""it must be good, the whole table went silent!\""? It was like that, but in an old booth in a renovated KFC serving the best food I've eaten all year. \n\nThe donuts were exquisite. The artisan donuts that this unassuming place pumps out... I can't comprehend it. My pear balsamic donut had a great natural pear flavor with a tart/sweet thing going on that ruled. My husbands chocolate pistachio rose donut was my favorite though, for the salty/sweet plus crunch deal. It was just all so good. \n\ntl;dr: this place is unassuming perfection with the best chicken I've ever eaten, a great outdoor space, good donuts and Stevie Wonder on the speakers. It's a must."
4446	1	a	Absolutely love this place I went for the chicken breast with Korean Chili Sauce w/miso butter corn and a Maple Bacon Donut! Top notch, the chicken was so good and juicy. Loved the side and definitely the donut! I will definitely back in the very near future for some more good food. Have to get there early because they sell out fast...So you know it's amazing!
4447	1	a	When two great comfort foods meet\n\nWelcome Chicken + Donuts  serves exactly what the name says, fried chicken and donuts.  Everything at Welcome Chicken + Donuts is made fresh on the premises daily. \n\nWelcome Chicken + Donuts has the most  amazing flavored donuts.  The dounuts are truly inventive with flavors like espresso, maple bacon, PB&J, cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e, the list goes on and on. These donuts are a must try.\n\nOn my first visit I choose one of my favorite flavor combinations, Cream Cheese and Blue Berry.  My lunch companion choose the Apple Fritter and Wisconsin Cheese. The donuts were light, pillowy, and glazed with a wonderfully light sweet topping.\n\nNow let's talk chicken.  All I can say is the chicken at Welcome Chicken + Donuts is delicious.  The chicken has  a crispy well-seasoned skin, and juicy tender meat, just like chicken should be.  Welcome Chicken + Donuts use a unique blend of varuous spices to give a world flavor to their chicken.  You can choose to have chicken seasoned with a dry rub or wet, both are delicious. \n\nTogether or separately - the chicken and donuts all winners.  I definitely recommend Welcome Chicken + Donuts.
4448	0	a	This will be an overall review of the food and staff.  I dont care what a place looks like as long as its clean and the food is good enough not to stay home and cook. We have been here a few times since they opened so we hoped for some improvement. The funny thing is when you get thru the front door they think you speak korean or japanese for some reason. I'm thinking I have been around the world a few times but your in Summerlin a local town. Get your english on point. Keep in mind I do speak a few asian languages but your in America and most of your customers aren't Asian. Staffs customer service skills poor.  Order to go one time waiting at the front door and same the guy asked me twice if I have been helped. I said don't you remember you ask me a few minutes ago and I still don't have my to go order paid in full online. The place was empty on that day. On to the food Sushi is ok most of the time. However my wife made a huge mistake and ordered the Seafood Sukiyaki it was horrible. The seafood was farm salmon and a few other odd items I think one was brown / gray tuna. No shrimp for you and that will be $18 soup aka Sukiyaki.\nWe are going to stop going here and just order to go from another sushi bar that is more professional with less drama also I agree with another yelper the names of the rolls needs a serious creative change its NOT dance club its local sushi bar. Also another review below was 4 star with a hair in the Ramen, How in the world do you give a 4 star with hair in the food? I approve this message J K KUHL...  Come on ES you can do A LOT better.
4449	1	a	So excited to be here with family and looking forward to some delicious sushi.  The restaurant is beautiful and the staff is very friendly!
4450	0	a	If you call this sushi, it would be a real insult to those real professional sushi chef who study and work hard to earn their titles.  Let me just say, I can not find anything right about this place. Sorry!!  The word Sushi and Sushi chef comes with an extensive training not a privilege of a color of your skin.
4451	1	a	I come here literally every week. Nice clean atmosphere where everyone is always happy to greet you. Amazing special fish selections from all over the world and everything tastes amazing. The servers are a great help when suggesting exactly what i was craving! Yumyumyum!
4452	0	a	"It is 6:45. Half the people in here have kids. Club music is playing and the last song detailed a sexual encounter, even using \""shit\"" and \""fuck\"". It is super awkward. They even have a children's section on their menu."
4453	1	a	A kosher bakery? Yes please! In the same plaza as the German Bread Bakery? Double yes! Carb mecca up in here.\n\nIn addition to a case full of sweet and savory baked goods with fillings like cherries, potatoes, mushrooms, spinach, and cheese, there are various wraps, paninis, calzones, and burekas. And it's mostly vegetarian and kosher. \nEggpant panini is delicious, but the House Special panini is probably even better, with zatar, pesto, egg, tomato, and cheese.  \n\nIf that's not enough, there are some dessert cakes available, a limited coffee menu, and also ice cream. Service is polite, decor is bright pinks and reds, and there's plenty of seating. \n\nRemember, they're closed on Saturdays for Sabbath!
4454	1	a	A little bit of Tokyo in Montreal .Brought by the Kinka family .\n\nOkay how am I supposed to review this ..\nFor once that I truly felt in love with such a restaurant in Montreal. A lot of people who know me knows that I'm a sucker for Japanese food --having had amazing experiences at Guu in Toronto and Vancouver. Although , the food is not 100% authentic , let's just say they nailed it in term of concept and food quality.\n\nMy experience here was  memorable as I got the opportunity to visit this place during their pre-opening week. \n\nOne of the first thing to note here is that their staff are new and I think it's going to take a hit of time for them to get down to their desired customer service and experience , I'm going to be fair and I'm going to say it was okay. Staff seems eager to get rid of your plates sometimes --without asking and eye contacts is not omnipresent. I guess those are things that they can work on.\nBut so far , I did see the manager on the floor , telling them how to become more efficient and how to give the best experience to customers. A+ to that man , he managed Toronto's Guu in the last and he will be in no time manage to get this restaurant to it's full capacity in no time.\n\nFood experience was excellent.\nThe Okonomiyaki was above average as compared to other places I've tried in Montreal. The pancake was just enough crispy to make me enjoy the squids! They didn't go overboard with their sauce either.\n\nThe gyu tataki salad was the most memorable plate for me. this plate was not only refreshing but the beef sashimi actually tasted amazing. One has to try to explain the feelings I had while slowly biting and savouring my experience with this dish. Indeed, if you come here , I highly recommend trying this.\n\nThe last dish I had taken was the Kimchi udon--I'll be honest , it wasn't great. I think it was a little bit overpriced and lacked some flavours. At that price , you could also expect a bigger portion when it's concern noodles and kimchi but it wasn't the case. \n\nOverall, I'll give this place 5 stars , from the moment I walked in and to the moment I walked out , I had a great izakaya experience. Although , it's not the perfect spot to drink just yet based on the crowd--I think it will only slowly become based on the service , food and my high expectations from Kinka family.\nFood wise it can definitely improve , and I hope it will as they can bring so many plates from their franchise. And to have a happy time , note that bottle of sake are not expensive, a group will easily have a blast with booze if they want.\n\nDo I plan to come back here in the future ? \nDefinitely , and then I will re-review my experience to see whether they have match ,exceed or failed to respond to my expectations.
4455	1	a	Hey hey \n\nI'm NUMBER ONE fan of Japanese food. I went with a group of 4 friends. At the moment we enter the restaurant, all the employee Welcome us in Japanese +(wave) :D (This made me happy).\n\nThey have a very nice place and seat where you can store your coat.\nWe were only 4, so we had to share a long table with strangers. (Awkward at first, but it was alright when the food arrived)\n\nSo many dishes to try !!! Luckily i did some research before, so i knew a bit of what I wanted to order.\n\nThe food came really fast. Beautiful, Flavourful, exciting!\nMy favourite one was the EBIMAYO. I go crazy for Fried Shrimp and those shrimps were super big haha.\nTakoyaki, Crazy quality. #Speechless\n\nFor the dessert, the Matcha creme brulee = Must-try (OBLIGER) lol\n\nFor the service, it was really good. Our Metal cup (yes) were always full and I liked how they ask us If we enjoy the experience. \n\nI was happy that another table celebrate their birthday.\nHalf of the staff went near the table and start singing in Japanese and Happy birthday in English. They even brought a blackboard with HBD on it. Even if it wasn't my friend bday, we could feel the excitement through us haha. \n\nWhen we left the place, they all screamed in japanese and waved at us. Best feeling ever!\n\nThis was an amazing experience. I recommend you all to give it a try.\n\nFood lover~\n\nYeye
4456	1	a	Superb! The service is great, and the food is quite delicious, however, a few items didn't have great presentation. The place is also quite loud, with the staff randomly cheering throughout the service. It adds to a very 'hip' urban ambiance, with seemingly 'traditional' menu items. They have a decent sake selection. I'd recommend anyone to check this place out!
4457	0	a	Pros\n- The food was delicious\n- The warm welcome from the staff upon entry is a very nice touch\n- Great decor\n\nCons\n- Our party of 16 was assigned a table that seated no more than 12. I had to sit sideways on the bench to accommodate everyone\n- Portions per dish are very small. Though I appreciate gourmet tapas, $10 for a fistful of spinach with a couple of mushrooms is a stretch\n- Our bill wasn't split, forcing us to divvy a $670 bill ourselves\n- One member of our party wasn't served at all after 2 hours of waiting\n- Ordering the grapefruit cocktail gets you a vodka/soda, grapefruit half and citrus juicer. Very original, but insufficient juice and less labor leaves you wondering why you paid the mark up.\n\nOverall\nMaybe the moral of our story is to avoid going in a large group. Cramped seating, divvied portions and a single bill all point towards the restaurant's inexperience in dealing with parties larger than 5. Though I loved the food, the value and the service will prevent me from re-visiting.
4458	0	a	I was excited to try this restaurant since I have only had great dining experiences at Guu Izakaya in Toronto and was told it was the same owners.\n\nKinka needs to step up their game if they want to survive in downtown Montreal.  I will start with the positives.  The waitress provided great service and was knowledgable of the menu.  Beer was good and the udon noodle with beef and mushroom was very good.  \n\nThe fish tacos I was served was a mistake.  The taco shell was dry and cold.  The onion cold slaw was cold and the fried fish was warm...very strange temperature for a taco and terrible shell. My friend did not eat half the taco shell because of bad aftertaste.   The beef short ribs were served cold and dry.  It lacked flavored and appeared to have been cooked the day before.  Finally the octopus wasabi paled in comparison to the version served at Guu Izakaya.  \n\nThey need to improve execution.  They also need to rethink a few of the dishes.  At the end of the dinner I gave my feedback to the waitress.  She apologized and removed the tacos and Beef ribs from the bill.  Very good gesture.   I hope the manager takes the feedback and fixes the problems.  Kazu and Idamake are much better choices.
4459	1	a	Definitely worth the hype. I am on a roll with izakayas recently and this place does remind me of Guu.\n\nWe showed up on a Sunday at 5 pm (the opening) and although being the first in line, the place filled up in no time after we sat down. Decor-wise you will find some small tables but more buffet-type larger tables for share. We were seated at the bar for a party of three and I got to peak at the food preparation and plating. As expected, the loud cheer upon arrival and departure is also part of the experience.\n\nFood-wise, a great izakaya. Seasoning of the dishes are on the stronger end. I can imagine those who like bolder flavours to love the food here. Ingredients were definitely fresh which would be expected with the amount of turnover at this place. One dish that was more memorable for me was the mackerel. It's not typically a fish I like but this was cooked tender, with a good balance of flavour and right amount of char on the skin. The other dishes we had were more the everyday variety (udon, Japanese pancake, tuna tartare, etc) and nothing was a let down. I feel like on a lazy day I can just close my eyes and chose anything and be guaranteed a good meal. Portions are quite large for an izakaya, you can guaranteed to be full if you have a carb-heavy choice per person (with other apps to share of course).\n\nAll in all, I can't wait to come back again.\n\nLast point - the girl's bathroom is quite a sight. Not sure if this is the custom in Japan but the bathroom was equipped from mouth wash, lotion down to sanitary napkins. I definitely don't see that everyday.
4460	1	a	A great steamed sandwich place in PGH - the steamed sandwiches are unlike any other sandwiches available in the city.  All the ingredients are local and super fresh - it's awesome to see PGH businesses support other local businesses and the community.  Breakfast sandwiches are insanely affordable and delicious, and I love the pretzel buns (also local). \nThe meatballs sandwiches are insanely good too (an old family recipe), and the meats are from Butcher on Butler (in Lawrenceville).  Also carries the best coffee in the Burgh, from Zeke's.  Definitely worth a trip, especially to try something new.  I'll be back soon!
4461	1	a	Very clean restaurant, extensive menu, and the takeout we got was delicious.  Spicy noodles, red curry, tom kha soup and shrimp spring rolls were all memorable.  The rolls were incredibly fresh.  There are whole kaffir lime leaves in the soup, which is a good sign that the chef cares.  Let's see, what else.. I love that they packed our takeout order with cardboard at the bottom of the plastic bag to keep items from tipping.  Attention to detail!  Prices are reasonable.  Give this place a try, for sure.
4462	1	a	Good, inexpensive Thai cuisine, well presented and no corners cut even as they keep their prices down. The service is friendly and the place is cozy and conveniently located. While parking in front of this commercial strip facing St. Joe's hospital is very limited, there is ample parking behind - as is known by those who frequent the popular 5th Avenue Cafe which happens to be their neighbor.
4463	1	a	As newbies to Phoenix, we have been looking for a great Thai restaurant for dine in and take out. After eating at Jasmine Thai we are confident that this will be our spot! \n\nThe restaurant is clean, service was speedy and the staff very friendly.
4464	1	a	"I miss good, cheap Thai food! I used to travel to LA pretty frequently, and I got spoiled in having a nearby restaurant that was good and cheap.\n\nJasmine Thai is good, but the prices are on the high side. The spicy shrimp coconut soup was tasty, but a similar dish would have been $3-4 cheaper in La. The chicken larb was very good, but it, too was a buck or two more than I thought reasonable. The papaya salad was the best dish; it was at an OK price.\n\nWe ordered the food \""medium spicy\"" -- always a good idea at a new restaurant. It came out with just the right degree of heat: my tongue stinged (strang?), but there was no  alcohol taste that sometimes accompanies overly spiced foods.\n\nMy beloved and I decided that this would be a once-in-awhile addition to our restaurant rotation, only because of the prices. Somehow, the food just doesn't seem to taste as good if you feel that you've been overcharged."
4465	0	a	Just opened today in downtown summerlin. Went for lunch w a colleague. Food was as expected from a CPK and the set up of the restaurant was really nice. This is the 3rd restaurant in the new shopping area that I've been to on opening day and the staff is always a little over zealous and nervous on the first day but jeez, the staff here today was annoying as hell. First, there were probably as many people in staff as there were eating. Our server interrupted us frequently, and was heavily pushing from the start a dessert we had no interest in for lunch. My food was almost taken out of my hand while I was still eating. I was asked probably 10 times in 10 minutes if I was done or wanted a to go box from about 6 different staffers. Also was additionally asked the same over and over for drink refills after we said no. \n\nI'm excited about the new restaurant but just let people eat and enjoy the food and atmosphere! We were patient and understanding for a while but it got to be too much so we left and walked around for a bit. I'll come back but I hope the servers will be more acclimated and less pressured to sell and serve. It's obviously coming from the management but there's a fine line between being helpful and ruining the experience.\n\nI'd suggest going here to check it out but maybe after they've been in business a month or so.
4466	1	a	Food was good\nService was amazing \nWay better than the Crave opening we went to next door a few weeks ago. We ended up walking out of Crave. Our server was fabulous and everyone was friendly
4467	0	a	CPK is my favorite place for the past 25 years!\nThe menu is missing a lot of items!  As for the wait..... There were clean tables available and they still made us wait....not very happy with our experience here... We eat twice a week at CPK but will not come back to this one! I gave them 2 stars for the decor!
4468	0	a	I enjoyed their food on several occasions in the recent past, but the music is played way too loud.  I know it's the trendy thing to do currently, but it adversely affected my party's dining experience.  I asked for the music to be turned down, but restaurant staff didn't seem to care.  Would not return due to the ambient noise level.
4469	0	a	I don't know what happened to this location of CPK!  We have loved other locations but I think this location did not get full training on what constitutes a meal!  I ordered BBQ chicken salad and got - literally - 2 tiny nuggets of chicken, about 1 inch each - on a pile of lettuce for over $10.  My husband ordered his all-time CPK favorite - BBQ chicken pizza - and said the same thing - hardly any chicken!  For a $30 meal, we ended up with cheap carbs and lettuce.  I'm appalled that the CPK franchise would allow this!
4470	0	a	"I have only gone to the CPK in Town Square a couple times and it usually is good. I was excited when one opened up near me. My boyfriend and I went here for New Year's Day lunch - it wasn't that busy as I thought it would, thank jeebus. When we first arrived, we asked how long the wait would be but we ended up sitting at the bar anyways. The bartender was very friendly and I got my beer right away. \n\nMy boyfriend got some type of soup and it was farely good. They had actually forgotten that they had already brought us one and had brought another one out. When I looked at it, there was a really long piece of hair in it and let the waitress know - her reaction? \""Eww\""...I was like uh ok, no apology, she just took it away. Starting from this point, I was very weary and probably spent more time looking through every morsel of food I picked up with my fork than actually enjoying my food. I had gotten the garlic chicken pasta and my boyfriend had gotten some type of garlic pizza - we love garlic, obviously haha but before every bite, we made sure there wasn't any hair on it. It was actualy quite tiring. We had a lot of food left over and ended up taking it home...to throw away. \n\nAll in all, I wouldn't return here because that piece of hair made me think that the cooks are not properly putting on hair nets or whatever if at all!!!"

4472	1	a	Great to finally have a Tapioca Express outside of California. I have had it a few times and happy they opened up a location in Las Vegas. To add to that a good boba place on the east side of town! I came in on Monday night and there were a few patrons, I usually don't get too adventurous but how risky can you get considering it's a boba place? I must add though I hate when I try something out of the norm and am not satisfied. So I went ahead and order the hazelnut snow because I wanted it ice blended. Mmm, mmm! It sure was delicious. I'm glad they were able to execute the good taste of the drink just like California locations do. I notice when something is popular in California and then comes to Vegas it is just not as good. Thankfully this Tapioca Express did not disappoint! Their POS card system was not working that night and I only had my card on me so it left them no choice but to give me the drink on the house. I was certainly thankful for that and a reason I am writing them a review. Since the POS card system wasn't working the service was a tad bit slow, but I could tell the employees were doing what they could to get through their processes faster. The inside is of course new, which nice clean and somewhat modern touches. Tapioca Express is definitely my new boba spot in town!
4473	1	a	I visited this place for the first time. The interior looks very new and it's nicely decorated. I tried the strawberry and banana with boba. I noticed they did not use real strawberries, but instead they used a syrup. Taste wise, still tastes very much like strawberry and banana though! \n\nI would recommend this place for boba.
4474	0	a	The place looks pretty promising. That changes the moment you talk to one of the cashiers. I asked her about one of the items in the menu, and she looked really puzzled. She then answered that she doesn't know at all mainly because she doesn't work in the kitchen. That right there is a bright red flag that I probably should have left. As someone that works at a restaurant, you should be well aware of what it is you're selling. Not only that but she also made various mistakes on our order. All of this was going on while manager was clearly standing next to her. He did absolutely nothing to help us or clarify anything. The food, itself, is not as appetizing especially for it's price. I do not recommend getting the sisig fries. It was pretty disgusting.
4475	0	a	Terrible and Horrible customer service! I was so disappointed in this store. I went in very excited to buy some gifts, and ended up buying a gift for myself - which is rare. When i got home I found out that my daughter had bought me the same gift for Christmas, so i went back to the store three days later with receipt in-hand to return. The clerk accused me of scratching the watch and tried to belittle me in front of the other customers - I was disgusted by his treatment. I have been a loyal MK customer for years - When i called the 800 number they could not believe the treatment that I received and logged it down as a formal complaint - I will never go back to that store.
4476	1	a	Great new North Scottsdale spot!  The space is beautiful - huge patio, really nicely done.\n\nService was awesome, food was perfect. Tried the Burrata appetizer.  Simple, fresh and just right.  Bucatini and Ravioli for dinner.  Both were excellent.  Oh, and the Tiramisu was the best I have ever had.  Stuff dreams are made of!   Really great experience and will most definitely be back.
4477	0	a	We arrived at 6:45, and it is now 8:35. We haven't received our food yet. The service had been pretty lame. Not that many people are even in the restaurant at the moment.
4478	0	a	I was part of a party of six for dinner here over the weekend and I must say... The service was terrible. The communication from the server was very limited and we feel that she had poor communication with the chef and the owner. We waited a sad two hours for any food to come to our table and when it arrived, it was the complete wrong order while others around us were enjoying theirs. We got fed up and spoke to the owner. The owner was a little off. Instead of sympathizing with us, he belittled the situation and made us more upset. I hope they fix their service and get their restaurant in order. The least they could have done was offer us an appetizer to hold us over.  I am never going back! We thoroughly enjoyed our dinner down the street at The Lamp. Order The Gem or The Margarita Pizza!
4479	1	a	Excellent wine list!  Great decor.  Food was great.  I was with a party of 8 and everyone enjoyed their choices.  Mushroom risotto was cheesy and delicious!  Recommended!
4480	0	a	After a good first experience mid-week,  our return visit was a disappointment on a Friday night. Although they accommodated us as we arrived early, the table was by the door and every time it opened we got a blast of cold air. The waiter was proficient, but it took over an hour for the entrees to arrive after ordering. Then my veal chop arrived basically raw when I asked for medium. It eventually arrived after the rest of our party were done their meals. A free desert was provided to try and make up for the gaff, but the overall experience was far from adequate.
4481	1	a	"Finally, after 15 years, a reason to stay North of the 101. Spiga, open about a month now may be the best Italian restaurant I've been to since moving here. It's hip, stylish, busy, happening and the food, service, prices, selection and ambiance kills on all levels. The owners, Fernando and Paula know restaurant management and they know how to keep people happy and engaged. With their happy hour, this may very well become my new \""Cheers.\"" Bravissimo!"
4482	1	a	So excited to have such a great restaurant closer to home!  Our first visit tonight and I my family is still raving about it. We had chicken parm and even though they didn't have my son's favorite dish on the menu they made it for him anyway. All of it was amazing. We finished up with tiramisu and it was also delicious. Portions are generous and they have a great wine selection. The service was also impeccable. We will definitely tell our friends and we will be back for sure!
4483	0	a	We had dinner here tonight for the first time. Had high hopes given the investment made in the update from previous place.  Decor is nice.  Wait wasn't bad, but after waiting the 20 minutes quoted they made up a high top in the bar and had us sit there anyways.  Table was very wobbly so manager comes by and has us pick up all our drinks while he attempts to fix the table. Odd for a nice place. We get one glass of wine each and then have to wait for the waiter to have time to check on us again to ask for second.  Foods comes before we get our second glass.  My wife said her's was good, she got the ravioli dish.  I got the pollo parmigiana, came out with burnt edges.  Should have been caught in the kitchen.  Waiter was not attentive at all.  Never checked if everything came out ok or checked back on us before asking if we wanted the bill.  Sorry, usually will give a place two tries but this one loses on round one.
4484	0	a	My wife and myself have been to Spiga three times now. First time for  a salad and pizza. I must say the pizza was quite tasty as well as the salad. \nWe had a pizza with sausage and onion and roasted red peppers. Chewy crust and easy to fold and eat. They use fresh mozzerrella which is a plus. \nSecond visit was nice as well, with us only having a pizza.\nBut after sending friends there last week and getting a gloom and  doom report of bad service, cold food and not very tasty we decided to go back for another try for ourselves.\nWe chose new years.\nWhy  do people always say do not go out for dinner on that day? In my way of thinking a good restaurant is operating at full capacity every day so why should a date make it different?\nWELL First of all they did not tell us there was a limited menu. That sucked because they left off many off the foods we were going for. That said we ordered a pasta dish that had no flavor, and the braised brisket over Polenta. The brisket was tasteless and luke warm. The polenta was cold.\nThe pizza we wanted was not on the menu last night either.!\nI think they have a tough road ahead unless drastic changes are made ASAP, So I would say go at your own risk and order only the pizza!!!
4485	1	a	What a great event! More details to come! But had a blast enjoyed seeing everyone and playin games and bowl!
4486	1	a	Yet another excellent event! The husband and I had a great time hanging out with our fellow Yelpers and bowling! There was honestly a point where I said... I hope they don't bring out any more food (I don't think these words have ever come out of my mouth before...)... they kept bringing out wave after wave of food and I couldn't help but eat it.... it was ridiculous! I would say the best item was the spinach artichoke dip... this was good on the chips, but even better on top of the pizza ( I know... I'm sick!). The beverages were also tasty, the margs were at the perfect level of sweetness. Thank you for a great event Lindsey and Lucky Strike!
4487	1	a	It always a special treat when a Yelp Elite event launches start of the weekend.\nI had a blast at the Yelp's Game Night at Lucky Strike and Gypsy Bar. Amazing food, drinks, and endless of fun! \n\nI signed up for the last bowling time slot. I wanted to enjoy the beautiful decor and mingle with fellow Yelpers. It worked out perfectly since we were all treated to 1 hour of free arcade fun. I reverted to childhood when it comes playing Pac-Mac. They have a huge screen with 4 players too. Thanks to Lindsey for letting me play her game while she stepped away.  I forgot how highly enjoyable yet challenging game it was. Her hubby wasn't too shabby, either! ;) I played a few other arcade games with Monica O. and Judy L.  There was one machine that might need a little work. You can't really throw flat footballs. The arcade room was a great way to kill time too.  \n\nAfter a long wait, it was finally my turn. It was so dark I can hardly see the bowling pins. I was surprised that I got over 100. I had a great time bowling with Neil D., Scott, and Leslie M. Good laughs!  \n\nThe LS staff truly did an outstanding job providing us the food items and drinks.  The food kept coming and was still warm, mac cheese balls, margherita flat bread pizza, Belgian fries, spinach & artichoke, and chicken sliders. All delicious!\n\nThank you for your great work Lindsey and keep doing what you're doing! Thanks to Lucky Strike for really fun night!
4488	1	a	Had a great time at this Yelp event, and so did the friend we brought along. I don't bowl, but it was great to sit and chat and watch others bowl. I loved the flatbread pizzas- nice change from the usual heavy bowling alley fare. The breaded macaroni and cheese bites were great too. Oh, and bottles of hand sanitizer as Yelp favors- genius at this time of the year!
4489	1	a	It was a Friday night and for Phoenix Yelp Elite Lucky Strike was the place to be! Lucky Strike opened up their doors and lets us Elite get our game on!\n\nEveryone bowled to their hearts content, we even had an free hour of game play in the arcade, that's where a basketball shoot out when down between Linda W and I, have to say we both walked away a winner that night!\n\nIf you started to feel weak from the energy spent playing the games, there was an never ending supply of food to eat! Some tasty chicken sliders, crispy French fries, fried cheese balls, pizza and much more!\n\nIf you got parched, they offered plenty to drink too! Margaritas, Moscato and much more.\n\nA BIG BIG Congrats to Lindsey & hubby on the future Yelper to be!\n\nThis was a fun great interactive event, a perfect kick off into the weekend! It was great seeing everyone enjoying themselves and the games!\n\nThank you Lucky Strike for hosting us and Lindsey & Yelp for another amazing event!
4490	1	a	Yelp's Game Night was so much fun! We Elite Yelpers definitely got lucky at Lucky Strike and Gypsy Bar. A huge thank you to Lindsey, Yelp, and Lucky Strike/Gypsy Bar. \n\nUpon arrival, a game card was handed out for one hour of game time over at Gypsy Bar. This included Pac Man, ski ball, air hockey, basketball, Wheel of Fortune, Terminator, Guitar Hero, a racing game, and a few more. I was the reigning champ of air hockey and won four times in a row. \n\nIn the VIP room, there were four bowling lanes for us Yelpers to enjoy. While waiting for bowling, there was plenty of food being passed around. Chicken sliders, pizza, French fries, spinach artichoke dip, and deep fried mac'n'cheese. To quench your thirst, there were margaritas, wine, and beer. What a feast! I really enjoyed the pizza and the fries (which were super crispy). \n\nOverall, it was such a fun experience! Again, thank you Lindsey for putting together another amazing event. Plus, thanks to Lucky Strike and Gypsy Bar for having us. I will definitely be back.
4491	1	a	Had a great time and SOOOO happy it was on a Friday so I could attend a long overdue Elite event.  \n\nTempt me with bowling, beer, and games and I am always in.  I had a blast all around the event was great.  1 hour of games with plenty of options to not be waiting in line and another hour of bowling was awesome.  \n\nThe food was great too I can't get enough of those friend mac and cheese bites.  They are so bad but soooo freaking good.  \n\nThanks Yelp for setting up another great event and thanks Lucky Strike for having us all.  Can't wait to go back and start racking up points on my VIP card :)
4492	1	a	We were so darn excited to play unlimited arcade games, that we never managed to actually bowl!  But never fear, we still had an insane amount of fun, with the drinks, grub, and THE GAMES!!!\n\nSomehow I had been here before yet had no clue the arcade section even existed!  The only sad thing for me was that since we weren't able to redeem our games points for prizes, we also couldn't see how many points we managed to amass.  And...I know I'm not the only person who wishes they knew how much it would've cost to play as many arcade games as we managed in our hour. :)\n\nThe staff were very welcome and accommodating to us, even though we were there at a fairly busy time (Friday night!!).  Of course, thanks to Lindsey and all the crew involved!  We had a blast! (And ate waaaaaaaaay too much of the fried macaroni and cheese bites)\n\nPS By the end of the evening my arms actually hurt from my amazing hoops shooting...talk about out of shape!
4493	1	a	"Lucky Strikes, already one of my favorite places for bowling and video games cause I totally dig their design and vibe. It has style and it's mostly for adults- although kids can have a great time too as we've attended several kid birthday parties here. \nSo when Lindsey posted this as an Yelp Elite event, I happily RSVP'd yes!  \nThe crowd was large, a +1 event- this just goes to show you the generosity of Lucky Strikes. We were treated to bowling, one hour endless play at the arcade, and the Gypsy Bar was also open to us (although I think no one ended up going to the bar/ dancing area)- we were all too busy having fun at bowling & the arcade!\nAnd the food!  It was never ending. There was pizza (very thin, crispy crust), buffalo chicken sliders, spinach dip, fried Mac and cheese dip, and French fries. All the food was good, much better than the typical bowling alley food. I love their fries- yum, yum, so delicious!  Yes, of course the night turned into my food cheat night!  And did I mention that the food just kept coming!!!  It was fantastic!!!\nI think if I lived closer downtown I would be a regular at this joint. Being that I don't live close by, I always get excited to be invited for an event or celebration here- and I always say yes!!!\nI wonder if I talk sweetly to the event coordinator that works for Lucky Strikes, she'll share with me the parties that are booked- this way I will have more reasons to show up and \""pretend\"" I am one of the guest?!\nLOL- alright, I think this place is one coolness!!!"
4494	0	a	I had the most worthless experience with these guys. I bought a big bottle of juice thinking it was a different flavor. My mistake but this guy wouldn't swap it out. That's a lot of expensive juice to choke down. I was one of their first customers and spent another 50 bucks during this visit alone. Not to mention the hundreds spent prior to today. Too bad. I was glad to see a decent vape store so close to home. I'll drive a little further to get better service. Bad customer service is a big reason businesses fail here in Buckeye.
4495	1	a	Man... if that was the celebration for just being halfway to Cinco De Mayo.... the real Cinco celebration is a must-go-to event.\n\nI was running a bit late, so had to park way back in the neighborhood (I was lucky to find my car after the event), but I was pleasantly surprised at the wonderful evening put together by the staff at Tijuana Flats and our CM.\n\nThe food and drinks just kept coming and our servers were definitely going above and beyond to showcase the restaurant's food and great people.  It was really good to hear a little about how TF got started an how they are opening stores like crazy (good thing).... but whats even better is that all their stores don't look the same, so they are always breaking the mold - with a lot of success it seems.  \n\nFunny enough, the table I found myself at all hailed from the Matthews/Mint Hill/Stallings/Indian Trail area of town so we got to talk about our fav spots and compare notes.  Oops, I forgot Peggy... but it was good to meet some new yelpers and catch up with Peggy (who was cracking me up last night).\n\nI did end up with some beer on my pants... Yup, it was that kind of night.  But it's all good since I was sitting on a lucky chair with a green sticker that won some hot sauce.  Keep the beer parade coming to my lap if I keep winning things....  that probably doesn't sound too fun now that I think about it.\n\nPoprock was there as usual rocking it with the camera.  Hopefully the event got you ready for your trip to Mexico!  I managed to smile for you this time and not stick my tongue out at you.\n\nThanks to Niki for a great event... and for the mustache that now lives on potential black-mail photos.
4496	1	a	What an awesome event and we sure did pack the place with a great group of people(yelp and staff).  And tons of food and free booze to that and why wouldn't I give it 5 stars.  Parking was a little difficult, but we yelpers are pretty resourceful.  Other than that, things went quite smoothly.\n\nI walked in about 10 minutes late to see the place already packed with fellow yelpers.  After getting my name tag I looked around to see if I recognized any familiar faces.  I did, but instead of going for my comfort zone, I decided to dine with 3 strangers.  Which turned out some great diverse conversations.\n\nAs per the venue.  The hot sauce bar alone will get me back in the door.  So many choices, I just started taking shots of them.  My stomach is strong(for now).  The layout is kind of like an upscale fast food joint with some nascar themed paintings, extremely random decor on the walls, and even a nice TV to boot.\n\nBooze wise, they offered pretty much whatever we wanted.  Being that I may be one of the most interesting men in the world, I had to go Dos Equis.  No regrets, great beer.  They had other above average beers on tap such as an Octoberfest.  I also saw plenty of people drinking wine as well.\n\nThe first bit of food that came out was the chips and accoutrements.  The guac was solid, probably one of my favorite things of the eve.  The cheese was of the nacho consistency and the salsa was pretty straight up salsa.  Of course I added some smack my ass and call me Sally sauce to it.  Next came a flauta stuffed with cream cheese and jalapenos.  A great play on a popper.  Then came another flauta, this one with chicken and cheese.  It didn't really do it for me honestly.  Then a blackened chicken taco with beans and rice was put in front of me.  Not bad at all, and it would be rude to leave anything on the plate, right?  So, I just kept on eating.  Next up to bat, a big ole burrito.  Good thing we split it, I was past full by this point.  Oh yeah, dessert, LOL!  Another flauta!  Cookie dough.  Pretty damn tasty.  And the churros as well.  Not too shabby.  Towards the end of the meal I got up and took a look at the menu.  This place is CHEAP!  Great amount of food per theoretical dollar.\n\nAs the staff had done all night, they took one more chance to talk with us.  A $10 gift certificate was in our future.  Man these guys know how to spoil some yelpers.  Thanks a lot to the whole crew for such hard work.  I hope others tipped as much as I did.
4497	1	a	This event was everything from the moment we stepped foot into the door. I say we because I am carrying a baby. I totally look forward to each and every elite event this event didn't fall short of AMAZING from the ambiance, the staff, the food & the great company. \n\nWhen I step into the event there was a free table with no one so I decided to take a seat. After sitting there alone reading the menu for short while a group of individuals behind me sounded very entertaining so I decided to turn around and join them. That was a great idea as I met a great group of ladies and we discussed food Charlotte and yelp. As each course of food was presented with explanation by Brandy and the manager, we paid close attention & anxiously awaited our chance to taste.\n\nI was pleasantly surprised with the quality & taste of the food as I've never heard of this restaurant even on my business travels to Orlando and Raleigh. It was great to learn more about the history & various locations as I would LOVE to support in and out of Charlotte. \n\nFOOD: Each course was served Hot & Fresh full of flavor & with enthusiasm from the staff.\n\nSTAFF: Pleasant and Attentive, very professional \n\nAMBIANCE: The graffiti around the venue was so vivid, bright & eye grabbing. I enjoyed reading it and taking pictures. \n\nYELPERS: Friendly as usual\n\nI was lucky and WON a bottle of one of my FAV hot sauce Flavors (Smack my A$$ and call me Sally).. \n\nI appreciated Brandy for taking me on a Hot Bar tour and suggesting several sauces for me to try and I LOVED them all. \n\nGreat Event All in All
4498	1	a	I had never heard of Tijuana  Flats before  the Yelp invitation.  But, trust me, I won't be forgetting about it any time soon.\nThe atmosphere is very bright and colorful.  There were several tables ready and waiting for us.\nThe first appetizer was a bowl full of chips with queso, salsa and quacamole.  The chips, handmade by the restaurant, were crunchy and a bit salty.  The accompanying condiments were yummy.  I especially liked the queso.\nThe next appetizer was the Atom Bomb and featured fresh jalape\u00f1os.  I think that I could have made a meal off of them, but glad that I didn't attempt this because there was so much more.\nThen, we proceeded to the entrees.  And, here is where I felt very special.  Tijuana Flats knew that I was a vegetarian, thanks to our hostess Nikki.  And, when they presented me with vegetarian plates of food, they did so in such a way that I felt like a Queen, not a freak.  All of the entrees were excellent, but here is where I got crazy with the hot sauce.  As some of you know, I am a hotoholic.  And, Tijuana Flats had this beautiful, little hot sauce bar.  A smile on a bottle indicates that it the sauce had a pleasant zing.  A frown meant......whoa.  I headed to the frowny side, where I encountered a sauce so hot that I was speechless for a good 15 minutes.  Holy Mother of Ghost Pepper.\nThen, there were churros for dessert.  I was stuffed by then and only took a bite.  I don't have much of a sweet tooth anyway.\nWe were also treated to beer and wine.  Much appreciated.\nBrandy and Kyle were the spokespeople for the restaurant.  They were excellent at hospitality, as were the servers.  They also gave us a gift card.\nTrust me,I will be back.  I want to go toe to toe with that hot sauce again,
4499	1	a	Had a freaking blast! Don't know what more to say...the food was delish (although the dough they use is basically for everything so many things can taste the same). THE CHIPS ARE AMAZING!!!!! best in Charlotte. I think I ate like 7 bowls?!\n\nThe staff was friendly and full of life. Management was very welcoming and wanted their staff and customers to have fun.\n\nThank you so much Nikki & Yelp for this event.\n\nI know because this was an event there is a bit more of a special treatment. SO, this is only being reviewed based on the event.\nHubby & I will definitely be going back to try it out on a regular day/evening, but I have a feeling it won't be any different ;)
4500	1	a	Sauce, Sauce, and More Sauce.\n\nWe got private VIP treatment to taste what Tijuana Flats has to offer.  I asked around our table and most of the Yelpers have never been or even heard of the place. Unfortunately, they're overshadowed by Bad Daddy's Burger Bar close by.\n\nHowever, I would now give them a try. Their version of jalapeno poppers were the best on the tasting menu with the fresh jalapenos.  Everything else was pretty standard but they do have weekly deals to bring you in during the off nights.\n\nWith all the saucy selections (from sweet to f-ing hot!) there's going to be something there for everyone to put on their standard burritos and tacos. My one criticism is that the burrito didn't have enough meat/ filling making it less desirable than a Chipotle where they load up the insides. Otherwise, the event was great and a positive effort by the team at Tijuana Flats!
4501	1	a	Was looking for a place to eat after my  Gym work out.   walked to Panda Express ,   then i saw the New Thai food been open,      Phuket Thai Cuisine  ,  on 4040 S Arizona ave ,  chandler .\n\ni walked in   there is like  15 -20 tables or so.   place look  very well,  very  clean,  very nice. \nwas  not busy,  but  its a  Tuesday night .    \nthe  menu is great,  they have it all.    the food  was good.   or  good +  .  i  really liked it,  and will go there many  times again.\n\nservice?   well  its a new place, i think  they  still learning  ,   but they  was very  good,  very  polite,  was this  sweet lady ,  who help the server ,  she  was FUN!!!   overall   i  had a  great meal,  and had a good  time!   well done  and best of luck to the new place in my hood
4502	0	a	Spent the last 10 years living in Thailand. Visited Phuket Thai on Friday evening at 5:00 PM. 14 other diners. The restaurant is new, fashionably decorated and very clean. Service is on the slow side, as if this is the owners first restaurant venture.  Food came out before sticky rice etc. The duck (16.95) was very dry and the worst I have ever had. No where close to what you get in Thailand. Pad See You was good, although on the sweet side. The papaya salad was very bland and even at the highest spice level, not spicy at all. Made for Americans is all I can say. Lob (chicken) was tasty. Spicy and sour wings (7.95) for 6 dry wings drenched in excess sauce. Chauhan (thai ice tea) close to original. Ate with my Thai wife and Thai son. It is a nice atmosphere, however, the large size lady is very loud, speaking above the whole restaurant when she takes orders. For my family, we prefer Thai food made for Thais. This is just too bland for our liking. It is quite expensive compared to other Thai restaurants is the area. 10% off for cash, told once we had already ordered. At this time I would not make a repeat visit which is a shame because the food quality does not match the stylish restaurant. Total bill for 3 $80.36.
4503	0	a	"We had lunch here today, party of 2. The restaurant atmosphere was nice, decoration and cleanliness were a thumbs up. I observed a lot of new clients trying the place out. Service was lacking though, observed 2 party's leaving just because of the wait and lack of service. Though keep in mine we got seated and our service was good and attentive.\n\nFood we ordered: Pad Thai, Panang Curry Beef, and Tom Kha Gai Soup. Unfortunately the Pad Thai had to much sauce. The dish was thick and gummy and bland. The Panang Curry was just as bland, the curry sauce was like soup that didn't stick to the meat. The Tom Kha Gai Soup was tasty but was lacking a slight thickness that curry milk adds. We were so excited for a local thai restaurant and unfortunately left so disappointed. In addition to another \""Yelp review\"" our 3 dishes for lunch $30 which in agreeance is high for the dishes we ordered.\n\nI'm sorry to say we will not be coming back, which is really sad as we need some good local flavors."
4504	1	a	Great chicken soup and spicy thai rice. Will be coming back soon to try some other dishes. Great food, great value.
4505	1	a	More awesome lunch to be had. Sometimes they are busy. But really, it's worth the wait. And every server is so nice!
4506	1	a	Great little place!  Pay cash for 10% off.  I HIGHLY recommend their drunken noodles!  The beef ones were delicious!!!  We will be back!  Yummy!!!!  My only complaint is the portions are way too small for the price!
4507	0	a	No, no, no!!!!! Had such high hopes for this place since it was close to home. Why are reviews so high? Their curry is thin and watery and all my dishes literally had no flavor. They are devoid of any taste or spices. Panda Express is disgusting and yet I think I would have had a better experience there. Run people!!!
4508	0	a	Sadly wanted to support a local business and Thai food is one of my weak points in the area. Had high hopes but this place let me down. Ordered the Pad Thai to go with mild spicy choice.\n\nIt wasn't so much the spiciness that I had an issue with, it was the lack of flavor...that's all I can really say sadly. The price was ok for the lunch special but will most likely not return due to the lack of flavor...\n\nTime to move on and hope for another Thai restaurant to open up in the area...
4509	1	a	So glad to see Last Shot Tattoo is back!!!!  Had my cover up done at the old Last Shot, and am happy to say that there is absolutely no trace of my ex wife's name on my arm anymore!!  Robby Slaughter is a great artist, and goes out of his way to make his shop a cool place to hang out and have work done.  Everything is sterile, and extremely clean, and prices are beyond fair for the great work they do........I highly recommend this shop, and can't wait to check out the new location!!!
4510	1	a	A great breakfast and lunch spot. Excellent food -- the breakfast burrito is stellar, as is the french toast. At lunch the bacon cheddar burger is excellent, and if you enjoy wraps you need to try the Turkey Cranberry Wrap - it'll remind you of Thanksgiving at any time of the year. \n\nIt hasn't been super busy any of the times I've visited -- yet. That will be sure to change as word spreads about this hidden gem. Nice job by the staff too!
4511	1	a	We got breakfast delivered a few times and it was great. Large stuffed breakfast burritos for a great price so delicious ! Great strawberry salad, and variety.  The best breakfast burrito I have ever had ! I will keep ordering the large breakfast burritos. He really hooks you up !
4512	0	a	I had a smoothie that was pretty good on Wednesday during grand opening. I am a smoothie snob. This was one of the better ones I have had. That being said I got a little 10 Oz portion (only one size) and it cost $9. this was one of the bigger ripoffs I have experienced in 2014 despite being satisfied with my one minute of drinking it. It would be 4.5 stars for the product and it gets dropped to 1.5 for the portion size and price. Service good. Nice people behind counter.
4513	1	a	"The Culinary Dropout at The Yard is a GREAT place to go for food, fun, games, drinks, events or just to hang out and relax. \n\nThe menu is awesome, the staff is friendly and the place is a lot of fun. \n\nThe Antipasti plates are a great way to start. They also have salads, soup, sandwiches and some really good entrees. The roasted salmon is tough to pass up. Other things on the menu are Shrimp and pork belly ramen, Meatloaf, fried chicken, a bistro steak with gorgonzola that is *really* good, sweet potato cannelloni and more. \n\nDo yourself a favor and save room for the \""Bourbon Black Bottom Pie\"" for dessert. You'll thank me, I promise. \n\nThey have a full bar and a bunch of specialty drinks, too. For local brews, they serve up hops from Four Peaks, San Tan, Huss Brewing and more. \n\nThe place is cool, for sure. Good for small and large groups. Private meeting space available, as well.\n\nValet parking is available.\n\nA great addition to Downtown Tempe."
4514	1	a	"I was privileged enough to be at Culinary Dropout's soft opening this past weekend. Sam Fox has done it again!!! What a great restaurant! The ambiance is very cool and casual. It caters to a 30's something crowd which is just what downtown Tempe needed. \n\nThe decor includes hanging lights, cozy couches with fire pits and murals of Johnny Cash and Freddie Mercury. There is ample space for large crowds or something a little more intimate, if you prefer. \n\nNow for the food! My friends and I started with the pretzels and fondue. Sooo delicious!! Not quite ready for entrees, we ordered the cheese plate next. I highly recommended the goat cheese. It's perfect!\n\nEntrees were finally decided. I chose the meatloaf. Most people wouldn't dare order something that \""only Mama can make\"". I'm here to tell you this meatloaf will make you slap your Mama! It's that good! Savory and flavorful and a generous portion. The green beans were on point too. The mashed potatoes seemed to be the instant kind. Easy to overlook with that meatloaf begging to be devoured!\n\nAs for the cocktails, they left a little to be desired. I ordered a Moscow Mule. For $10 a drink, I expected a little more punch. Nonetheless, it was a great drink.\n\nFinally, the service. Every person on the staff is friendly and courteous. They are all more than willing to tend to your needs. The only problem is, they blend in with the patrons. There is no uniform or name tag worn. You have to look for someone carrying dishes or drinks to know who they are. \n\nOverall, this is a much needed addition for the City of Tempe. I highly recommend supporting this restaurant. You won't be disappointed!"
4515	1	a	Opted for the burger on my first time in. It was perfect. I'll be working my way thru the menu. Welcome to the neighborhood
4516	1	a	The new Culinary Dropout in Tempe is a knockout.\n\nThe atmosphere is sharp, yet it retains the warmth and comfiness suitable for rustic gastropub fare. \n\nIn addition to food and drink menus, you'll get a starters checklist and a pencil. The charcuterie and cheese selection is excellent-- it boasts Spanish delicacies like Iberico ham and Marcona almonds. You've also got great treats like roasted beets in a sauce of vinegar or Brussels sprouts with Parmesan and currants.\n\nThe rest of the menu is tried and trued at the other locations, and the standard is withheld in Tempe. And-- what's this? Breakfast on the weekends?\n\nOur server Connor made the meal a real delight. \n\nCongrats to Fox for another hit restaurant.
4517	1	a	Culinary Dropout in Tempe is beautiful - a really nice space. Busy even on a Wednesday evening. The staff was incredibly friendly. \n\nThe fried chicken was probably the best or next to the best I've ever had, all time. It was amazing. Everyone else I was with loved their food. I also thought the grilled cheese sliders were great. They didn't try to over-fancify them. Just good, traditional grilled cheese. \n\nIt is a bit overpriced for what it is, but oh well. The menu didn't note that it was grass-fed or organic or anything, so I am not sure what kind of chicken it is to be so pricey. \n\nIt is a great atmosphere and delicious. I will definitely go back. Maybe next time 5 stars. I think they are still getting ramped up - I asked for a box and they threw away my food. They did make a completely full new meal for me and the waiter was super nice about it. The valet also took a pretty long time.
4518	0	a	"Fox Restaurant Concepts is a master of design and ambiance, but I find the food overpriced for the quantity and quality, and the staff undertrained.\n\nI was with a party of 6 and we ordered cocktails and asked for water. The drinks came within a reasonable amount of time, but it took 45 minutes (and several \""I'll be back with those waters\"" from our server) to get any water at our table. You know the feeling when you try to desperately ask your server for something because you can tell you won't see them again for a while? That was our experience.\n\nI ordered the Korean rib eye steak which was very tasty, but I don't think the portion on my plate was even a full 8oz of beef. Also, it was already cut? Part of the joy of ordering a steak is cutting it! Basically, it was served like fajitas... Not what I was expecting, I guess.\n\nMaybe we were the unlucky table with the 1 not-so-good server, but it leaves an impression you know? Like bringing us our bills with not a SINGLE pen! Hello?! To top it all off, valet brought back my truck and there were blotches of some mysterious white substance on my windshield, my passenger window, and all over the bed. So bizarre!\n\nI'm not a negative person, and it pains me to leave a negative review for a local AZ chain, but I feel let down."
4519	0	a	"I am an extremely huge advocate for how amazing culinary dropout is. However, this location needs to take a few pointers from the other two locations. I didn't even get a chance to sit down in this restaurant before being treated like trash by their hostesses. The four airhead hostesses that you had working tonight need to learn their job before being sent out into the world of restaurant hostessing. \n\nI've been a hostess. Your job is just that. To host and to be the first and last impression that your guests  have of your establishment. It's not hard to at least pretend to care about your customers.\n\nNow that I've had my rant, let me tell you about my 2 minute experience that left a sour taste in my mouth about this particular culinary dropout location. \n\nUpon walking into the establishment the hostesses just stared and didn't even greet us with a simple, \""hello\"". My boyfriend had to stand there for several moments before they acknowledged him. He told them how many it would be (it was going to be 4) and the hostesses, upon him asking how long the wait would be, responded \""I literally don't even know right now.\"" And we just looked at them. Then they go further on to say, \""all of the tables we have for the rest of the night are going to reservations, but you can sit on the patio at an open high top.\"" She also told us that one had just freed up and that we could have it. So, without even offering to show us the way, sends us out to look for the open table that supposedly exists. We go out there, no open high top. We walk back to the hostess stand and say to the girl that there are no open tables. She just replies, \""oh, sorry. You can sit at one of the couches on the patio.. But it's not full menu.\""\n\nOh. Thank you. I didn't come here to eat dinner. (Sarcasm).\n\nWhen we tell them that we have no where to sit because we want to eat dinner, they again, blankly stare at us and respond with a less than sincere \""sorry.\""\n\nMy boyfriend is not patient and tells them we are leaving because they are refusing to even offer to help us find a table. Again, less than sincere, \""sorry\"" as we walked out. \n\nI understand that it is New Year's Eve and that you have a lot of people to accommodate, but your hostesses, instead of standing there at the host stand, clumped together, should be out doing everything they can to try and accommodate ALL of the guests who want to dine in your restaurant. (That includes bussing tables, walking the floor to find open tables, or find almost finished tables). I've been a hostess and a waitress and these girls did not know anything about customer service in the food industry. And even if you can't seat me tonight, at least try and act sympathetic and show me that you're doing everything in your power to treat your customers well. Otherwise you're going to continue to lose customers to Postino right down the road.\n\nAgain, I love culinary dropout as you can probably tell by my previous reviews of the other two locations, but this one needs some work. The other two locations have customer service down to a science."
4520	0	a	"Fox Restaurants is part of my portfolio of good eats, however Culinary Dropout in Tempe is not 1 of them. First off; the make up air system for the exhaust grease hoods is waaayyy off, when you enter the building you experience the \""wiff\"" of a back alley Japanese teppanyaki grease fryer-smoke sensation, I had to drop off my clothes at the dry cleaners the next morning to rid this odor. If your not familiar with make up air its the air that is pumped in from the roof to provide the exhaust grease hood to make up for the air its exhausting, sometimes too close to an HVAC unit on the roof it gets pumped in for the patrons to breathe and smell. Second; the layout feels like a junior high school cafeteria with tables lined up in parallel, with all the \""cool kids\"" having fun tossing bags of beans back and forth in the adjoining Yard. Third; our server was pleasant, speedy, but lacked a smile, maybe had a bad day who knows? Fourth; we ordered the \""36 hour pork ribs\"", mistake, they were cold, apx. room temperature or just below, I felt like a cave man chewing the hard to separate meat off the bone, after which we asked where the restrooms were so we could wash our hands from all of the bbq sauce, our server pointed the way down a dreary hallway, why don't they provide a wet nap at minimum, for the $25 plate they should provide a hot towel! \n\nCulinary Dropout is a great matching name for the restaurant, I think every one staffed there may just be Drop Outs..."
4521	1	a	Awesome service! Food was surprisingly really good for a small Cafe. The lady with the strong funny accent at the counter was really helpful with some menu selections.
4522	1	a	"This place is going to be (already is) busy!  Its nice to have another fast-casual option in Summerlin.  \n\nWe went for \""brunch\"".  I use quotes because MTO is one of those restaurants that has a little of everything on its all-day menu.  Ordered a waffle for the kids to share, I had the Reuben, wife had some healthy looking thing with Quinoa cakes (it looked good but I didn't pay attention to the clever name), and got the chicken pot-pie for my dad. Green juice and coffee for the wife, soft drinks for me and dad. Some friends met us so I also witnessed the falaffel, the broccoli skillet, clam chowder, onion soup, and kids pancake.\n\nThe food was very good, everybody's looked appetizing and I was glad that my dad didn't finish his pot pie because it meant I got to help him with this pretty decadent dish.  Fresh chicken pieces with the veggies in a skillet topped with fresh baked biscuits... it was delicious and probably a million calories.  My Reuben was made with \""corned buffalo\""... I assume that buffalo is leaner than beef, from a taste perspective it tasted like traditional corned beef.  \n\nThe service was friendly and timing was fine (they apologized that it took long as they had only recently opened but it didn't feel too long to us... perhaps because we weren't in a rush and the kids weren't bouncing off the walls). \n\nA few things of note: \n- 4 entrees and 4 drinks... $76... not a bargain but not totally unreasonable in my estimation.  \n\n- They have one of those new fangled coke machines that dispenses hundred of different variations.  I like these when a restaurant is not busy, but they're a major hassle when busy as you wait for one person to select their beverage and then for the software to reset... not the restaurant's fault.\n\n- Coffee... my wife ordered a plain black coffee, when I went to the counter to request a refill I was meant with looks of confusion.  Finally someone said we are not currently set up for complimentary refills. I replied, \""fine, I'll pay for it\""... after a little more scrambling on their part I went back to the register with her cup, asked for a refill, was reiterated that there was a charge for refill, now replied with annoyance in my voice \""got it, charge me\"".  Upon paying the $3+ for an additional cup of plain coffee I said to the cashier \""I grasp the idea that you don't refill premium coffees such as lattes or cappuccinos but most breakfast-y places provide complimentary refills on plain drip coffee\""... He apologized and took 10% of the coffee (approx $0.30)... kind of insulting.  \n \nIt was a little cold on the outside patio but the heaters helped and it was nice because we could sit there and watch the kids play on the other side of the patio.\n\nWe'll be back."
4523	1	a	Free chocolate chip cookie with check-in!!\nThe cookie made my top 10 cookie list and the KFC was very good. Basically a Chicken Fried Chicken with gravy
4524	1	a	MTO is fantastic! Great food and great service! The manager David is awesome! They have both healthy food and comfort food! Great place for kids!  Check this place out you won't be sorry!
4525	0	a	"I had the Hangover Burger. I'll break it down by ingredient, you'll see why. \n\nI can't comment on the bun since I ordered it without one, but that wouldn't have affected my review. The ingredients are as follows: bacon, fried egg, Tillamook cheddar, special sauce, and fries.\n\nBacon: great. Cooked perfectly, tasted good. The quality of food I expected from a place like this. \n\nFried egg: amazing. cooked perfectly, seasoned perfectly. If every egg I had for the rest of my life was like this egg I would be happy. I typically order my eggs \""over medium\"" and very few people ever get it right. This came out just shy of a perfect over medium (that's what I assume is the standard way, as mine and my wife's were both that way and we didn't specify any particular cooking method when ordering). While it was shy of over medium, it was perfect for a burger. \n\nTillamook cheddar: great. This is pretty good cheese. Back when I ate cheese by the pound this is what I would get. Good stuff. Hard to mess it up though, as it's a specific brand. I got exactly what I expected from this.\n\nSpecial sauce: this was basically cole slaw. It was awful. Tasted like more sugar than anything, I immediately removed it all from the burger. Hugely disappointing, and incredibly over-sweet. Was also really runny.\n\nFries: just absolutely awful. Easily the most disappointing part of this meal. Taste extremely cheap and low quality. Very little salt, very little flavor other than that flavor you get when you know these fries are some cheap crappy bulk freezer section bag that have been reheated and left under a warming lamp for hours. Just awful. Terrible.\n\nHamburger patty itself: the flavor was only okay, but it is very visually unappealing. Looks like, again, something super cheap from the freezer section of a crappy grocery store. Blatantly pre-pressed and pre-formed. However, I asked for it cooked medium and it was cooked perfectly. Seasoned well, but the meat itself can only be dressed up so much. Both visually and in flavor.\n\nOn the plate, there were also two kinds of \""pickles\"". Definitely not my style. I tried both styles, expecting a pickle and getting something from the first that tasted more like a super-slightly-pickled cucumber, and from the second that again tasted like a more-pickled-but-covered-in-sugar cucumber. They were both very not good. I was able to eat the first, but I had to immediately spit out the second. Totally gross. I don't understand why the sugar featured so prominently, cucumbers are sweet on their own and pickles are not. These were not a good combination of flavors.\n\nIt's kind of sad to write this review, as the burger's flavor combination with the egg and the bacon and cheese really went well together, but the cheapness of the patty and the extremely disappointing fries make me suspect the quality of all the ingredients. The food is all cooked perfectly. Somebody in the kitchen obviously knows exactly what they're doing. The egg and bacon and patty were all expertly executed. What they don't understand is that quality ingredients are important, apparently. I will not be back here any time soon."
4526	0	a	Went to Downtown Summerlin location based on a recommendation. Arrived about 8:30, web says it opens at 8. Doors locked, employees looking at us from inside, don't bother to come to the door. Went to another door. Employee sitting a table drinking coffee doesn't come to the door. Apparently they were closed and it was too much of an effort for one of the employees inside to come to the door on a cold morning and let the 3 customers know why. With the growth of restaurants in Summerlin, this is the fastest way to grow bust. I typically write a review after I've dined in the restaurant but in this case their behavior speaks to me about the nature of this place. Doubt we will give it another try, too many other options.
4527	1	a	The young lady that took our order was very polite and pleasant. ThIs was our first time here so we had a lot of questions. Every time that we asked a question, Diana would jump in the conversation to answer. I believe she is the boss. Maybe if she quit micromanaging her employees, they could flourish on their own. \n\nI ordered the MTO breakfast.  I ordered scrambled eggs but was brought over-easy. No big deal. It was corrected and brought back. \n\nThe coffee was warm but far from hot. Diana said that she made the coffee when she first came in. Ya I could tell. The next cup was much better. \n\nAs for the food, it was pretty good. My wife had the broccoli omelet and said that it was incredible!!  My MTO breakfast was pretty good. \n\nI would definitely comeback but have something different next time. \n\nMy advice to Diana would be to give your employees a little more freedom to answer questions that are directed to them. They are friendly and intelligent. Remember, there is a reason that you hired them.
4528	1	a	I've been really wanting to try this place out since I would always pass by the dtlv location. I finally had a chance while shopping in downtown summerlin, and I am mind blown of how delicious it was! \n\nI had the MTO breakfast and I was not disappointed. It was also A LOT of food, which is always a plus, along with a hazelnut latte, also very delicious. It came with about 4 different kinds of meat, hash browns, eggs and toast, pure deliciousness! \n\nI was absolutely amazed at the hash browns, They had mashed potatoes in them!!! I will most define you be coming back to try the rest of their menu!
4529	1	a	I've been a fan of The Fresh Market for a while now but it's always been a little far from me. Now they've opened this location right next to my house and I'm so excited about it! \n\nMy first trip to this new location was on grand opening night so the store was packed! The first thing I noticed about the store is the size, it's fairly small and with the crowed from opening night that didn't help. Once you get past the size you see how nice, organized and well put together this store is. This is't my everyday grocery store but more for fresh ingredients. They've got the freshest produce, seafood and meats in the area, way above the quality you'd expect from a grocery store. There's a wide variety of fresh breads and chesses along with prepared food. In addition to all the fresh food the customer service is outstanding! From the management to the cashiers all the employees have a pleasant smile and warm personality.\n\nI'm looking forward to many more trips to The Fresh Market!
4530	1	a	This place looks awesome, the atmosphere is great and the kitchen in full view is top notch. The plates are on the small side, but I like that (usually too much food on the plate). And the food was great, except for that odd chorizo bread thing. Okay, the Fried Chicken isn't Montreal's best, but it's damn good and definitely NOT dry. The service was excellent too.
4531	1	a	If you have any issues with your car...just bring it to Great Guys Auto, and they will take care of it!\nHave a great day!
4532	1	a	Great little restaurant - good food, great service, and nice decor.  Happy to have it in the neighborhood!  I've already been twice and will be back again.
4533	1	a	We happened upon this place after seeing a movie nearby, what a pleasant surprise! Fun decor, food was delicious...loved the rice with cilantro and poblano chile, the beef chimi was perfect! The complimentary, warm apple empanadas were a great treat! We'll be back soon!
4534	1	a	Very authentic Mexican food.  Highly recommend the green sauce.  Also have a good lunch special.  Nice new place in our hood.
4535	1	a	New kid on the block and a winner for sure. Upon entering you'll be dazzled by the colorful d\u00e9cor and the gracious service. This is a very affordable little spot right near a neighborhood bar, a great cupcake shop, and the $3 Cinema. We were wowed by the flavorful salsa put before us - not too spicy at all. And the chips kept coming.... Terrific icy margaritas (I'd get the rocks marg next time) and well-priced beverages. Every single thing we tried was delectable ... except the tamale. Why is that? No matter, everything else was delicious and we'll probably make this our neighborhood Mexican spot for dinner. Their brunch menu looked pretty tasty too. YUM.
4536	1	a	I love Doggy a go go!  Krista is the best groomer I have found for my cats and Andee is always so nice on the phone when I schedule appointments. I recommend them to every person I know with pets!
4537	0	a	Stopped into this cute little place to purchase a pie to share at Thanksgiving. Though there was only one other couple in the place the energy was chaotic...now granted they were cranking out a lot of holiday pies but the girl at the counter did not even know the types of pies in case and seemed pretty clueless. Since they were out of many pies on the day I stopped by I was told that if I returned at 7:00 AM the next morning ( today) they would have extra pies that did not have to be pre- ordered. My husband headed down there today stood outside the door and was greeted at 7:05 by another clueless employee who had no idea what was going on but said that if you did not pre- order there were no pies available. My hubby was not too happy needless to say. Need to get it together and make sure all of your employees are on the same page and educated in your product!
4538	0	a	Had the great time having the delightful latte here. The steamed milk was perfect, I did liked it when I had the first sip to it.\n\nThis place could be better if they had good place and good service.
4539	1	a	Loved this place! Great food, huge portion sizes, some of the friendliest workers I've met, and they kept the coffee coming. Glad to have them in the neighborhood. We will be back soon.
4540	1	a	I'm glad Black Bear Diner is in Green Valley now! We were definitely missing a decent diner-style place for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. This location is spacious and clean. The service is friendly. There's a great variety on the menu and anything I've ever tried from Black Bear Diner has been delicious. Certainly nothing fancy, but reliably hearty portions (with smaller ones available) and good food. And you gotta love the bear theme - too cute.
4541	0	a	Slowest service I've ever encountered anywhere. Took 40 min to get our food . Food was just OK.. Not great. They ran out of soup and baked potatoes and after waiting 40 min they got my order wrong. Manager comp'd my bill . Not sure what all the hype it about this place. Kinda disappointing really
4542	1	a	"RAWR! The corner of Green Valley and Sunset has turned into bear country with Black Bear Diner!  Good to see that this family diner based in No Cali has expanded again with a corporate location now open in the Green Valley area of Henderson. \n\nHappy to have a place that serves breakfast all day and is open early and past 3pm unlike the breakfast places in the area. The newsletter type menu also lists lunch and dinner plates too!  Country homestyle comfort is the cuisine here. Sweet Cream waffles and pancakes, Country Fried Steak, Hot Tuna Melts, Pot Roast are just some examples.  \n\nThe serving portions are pretty big. Enough to feed a hungry bear. Even the cornbread muffin we had was pretty good size and more than enough for one person.\n\nCool points - They recognized the health & calorie conscious crowd . Sections throughout the menu list:\n\n\""Fit and Focus: breakfast offerings under 500 calories\n\n\""Little Less\"": smaller portions of some of the breakfast, lunch and dinner items. I ordered lunch from this section which was a Tuna Melt and it came with your choice of side;  fries, housemade potato salad, coleslaw, green salad OR cup of soup. \n\nThey allow substitutions.IE..If you are vegetarian or want gluten free they'll switch out the bacon for fruit. \n\nPrices are a great value for what you get. \n\nQuality of food, fair/good. Many items made in-house, the oranges are freshly squeezed thru an industrial sized juicer. \n\nExecution wise..needs more work...The hashbrowns on the first visit we got were not drained well enough and was a bit greasy.  Our second try at it we ordered it to be more crisp...still greasy..sigh.. Sweet Cream pancakes were okay. At least they weren't dense but not that fluffy either. \n\nOrders took longer than should be and first time they got my order mixed up with Mr. B.  ..minor glitches, but cutting them slack since they've been open less than a week.\n\nNot a fan of servers closing out the tab and giving you the receipt and you pay cashier..it's more convenient yes, but it just feels more rushed and you don't see your server much after they hand you the ticket. \n\nAtmosphere - Casual but not feeling the rustic lodge feel like their Redding location.  But every location is different and unique in it's own way. So since we're in the desert it's faux lodge ish.\n\nThey did a great job revamping this building that has been an eyesore for the past 3 years. Great use of space, plenty of booths and tables.There's even diner counter style seating in front of the partially open kitchen. \n\nI was thrilled to see and hear that the same guy still carves all the wooden bears (with a chainsaw) It was tradition when we traveled we would make stops at Black Bear Diners and our kids would take a pic with the bears that were 3x their size.\n\nService - Great personalities! Friendly and eager to please. Still needs work on a few areas.  Both visits we sat at our table for a good 5 minutes before anyone came and acknowledged us and take our drink order.  They apologized though for the wait. Some of the employees from their Cali restaurants flew over here to help out and train as the \""Opening Crew\"" . \n\nReally 3.5 but rating 4 for for value and for the choices they offer... plus the nostalgia won me over.  In time the Green Valley crew will rock the fifth star. Welcome to the Hendo hood Black Bear Diner!"
4543	1	a	It is nice to know that there is a place that serves great and delicious food at a reasonable price and that it is family oriented also the staff is very friendly and welcoming they are people that you would like to have at your house just to say.  Plus to top it off  they serve coconut cream pie for dessert hallelujah.
4544	0	a	Portions HUGE!  Rough night.  Waiting 30 min for a table... No biggie it's Friday night.  But our server could not handle the rush.  Waited 10 min (not an exaggerated time) for drinks then placed our order!  My food had a hair in it (it happens) but my friend son got presented a meal he did not even order and we're hoping in a few months things settle in and service and everything is more smooth and better!
4545	0	a	"Decided to make a second visit to this place. This time we decided to check out their dinner menu. Three of us this time. \nAgain, massive portions, very disappointing quality of food. A regional manager was in the restraunt watching all the staff. They were on their best bahavior and were on their \""A\"" game. \n\nThe food quality leaves a lot to be desired. I ordered the Tri-Tip. I ordered it medium rare. Service fast, Food quality poor. Meat was very over cooked and was like shoe leather. No sauce or juicyness. Asked for some au ju to dip my dry meat into. One of my guests tried their pork loin. Not really good. Marginal at best. Another guest ordered the small order of Chicken Fried Steak. Chicken Fried Steak was the best part of the entire meal. It was flavorful but, nothing better than you can find in many other places here. \nOur server Tammarra recommended the Bread Pudding for dessert. Very disappointing. It was not good. She had billed it as one of the best things on the menu. That was scary. It had been heated in a microwave. The top half was hot, the bottom was ice cold. The bread portion was like a dried out old cinnamon roll. It needed a vanilla sauce or milk sauce put on it. \n\nBy the time we got ready to leave, the place was packed and getting mobbed. Tamarra was able to get us a check, but, we didn't get a chance to discuss our meal with her.\n\nThey really need to work on their menu. The food quality is not very good. They concentrate on portion size and overwhelming you. The quality suffers greatly."
4546	1	a	I love diners.  I miss diners.  This one filled a void in my heart and stomach; I'm happy to have discovered it with a friend over my recent vacation.\n\nPlaced in a converted Chili's in Green Valley, this restaurant is at a great location with tons of parking and many other shopping places close by.  It's also next door to a public library.  The evening I went was very busy; the wait time wasn't fast but acceptable.  The decor favored black bears, for obvious reasons, with a very rustic/mountain feel.  It was easy to tell it was a small-scale chain due to their professional menus and their own brand of ketchup and hot sauces (all 3 were delicious: papa, mama, and baby bears! haha). \n\nThe menu is typical diner fare, which is exactly what we were craving.  Breakfast, lunch, and dinner are served at all times.  I opted for the California Eggs Benedict and was in love!  The food did not arrive quickly, but was worth the wait.  My eggs came with fruit and potatoes, the latter of which was not on the plate.  As an apology, an full sized plate of the potatoes were brought to the table (I thought there was no way I could finish them, but I was wrong- too delicious to pass up).  The food was an excellent value; the iced tea was strong and tasty.\n\nThe restrooms were large and clean.  The staff was very friendly and helped each other.\n\nI wish I had one of these close by!
4547	1	a	This place was delicious! Great service wonderful food! I had a burger and it was great. Had Apple crisp cobbler and omg I loved it! Highly recommend!
4548	1	a	This place is like going to find buried treasures.  You always find a little something or something BIG!  Staff is always helpful, the only downside is in the summer its very hot as they dont have AC.
4549	1	a	Great bargains if you take the time to look through the items...  Most people return perfectly good items and you can score a great deal here.
4550	0	a	The sum of my experiences at this office top to bottom are nothing less than upsetting for me. Gag orders that patients are forced to sign before receiving treatment sadly prevent them from speaking up and so I will say nothing else here about this office.  \n\nIn my opinion, if you want good health, don't take loads of calcium as some doctors prescribe... rather start with reading The Calcium Lie, (possibly also Stop The Thyroid Madness), begin a whole body cleanse, and go from there.  Happy health to you!
4551	0	a	MAs who can't take accurate blood pressure readings (if I'm really 160/100 on two different BP meds, I should probably be in cardiac ICU). Nurse practitioner who doesn't answer her phone or return VMs. Doctor who interrupts when I start to describe my symptoms. Redundant paperwork; really, is it that friggin' hard to use mail merge to copy patient info to multiple forms?\n\nIn fact, I don't know why I'm giving Chandler Endo two stars. Guess I'm feeling generous today.
4552	0	a	This is possibly one of the worst medical offices I've had to deal with period, and I deal with a lot of doctors offices given that I'm a caregiver. I've had numerous instances where I've tried to get ahold of a doctor or nurse or somebody to Answer a few questions about the medication and can't reach anybody but voicemails. And to try to reschedule an appointment was an absolute nightmare. Was on hold forever and only to be sent to another extension where of course it went straight to voicemail. I don't understand why either because anytime were in the office it's us and MAYBE one other patient. Avoid this location/office at all costs!
4553	1	a	Totally new experience now happening at this location! French bread and pastries flown in fresh from France. Coffee house extraordinaire so worth the drive.
4554	1	a	I'm so happy this place opened back up again. They have new owners and a totally new drink and food menu. \n\nJessie and I tried this place last Saturday. I was happy they were open cause I kept missing when they were. The hours are 8am-2pm Monday-Friday and Saturday 9am- till whenever they feel like closing up. \n\nDino who is the resident barista is super friendly and you can tell he takes pride in his craft. The food is very French inspired which is awesome to me. On the day Jessie and I came in we were looking for a breakfast type dish. They had lots of tasty sounding sandwiches, salads and even crepes, but we wanted eggs. Dino said he could make a souffl\u00e9. Yum!! It had ham, cheese, herbs de provence, and spring greens. On the side was two yummy pieces of baguette with sweet butter. Mmmmm so good! As for the souffl\u00e9 when it came out Dino said it was under done on purpose and to stir it. Which did cook the very runny eggs, but I always thought a souffl\u00e9 was supposed to be cooked through and fluffy. It still tasted good, maybe a little more salt next time. \n\nI liked the musician that came in and played guitar and sang. It really added great ambiance to the place. \n\nThe coffee is excellent and I'll totally be back to try a sandwich or salad. I wish they were open earlier and we're open on Sunday's. With that said I am very happy to have an independent coffee shop by where I live. Reminds me of being 16 again!
4555	1	a	They serve boba tea and just opened today 12/16/14 really clean and modern look people were nice
4556	1	a	I have gone here for lunch two days in a row and am love!! The firecracker salmon rolls and spring rolls are amazing! Loved the classic and BMB special are great sandwiches and are only $6 a piece! I tried a few specialty drinks but the taro smoothie with boba is my favorite. The coconut shaved ice is pretty fantastic too! The customer service is top notch and very helpful!
4557	1	a	Happy to note that a new Vietnamese eatery has been added to north Phoenix, and conveniently located on Bell Rd. just off I-17. Wondering why they decided to call it a bistro rather than just a restaurant, I decided to give it a try. It's definitely cozy, smaller than most Vietnamese eateries in the Valley but it's very clean and has a bit of a trendy look. The menu selection is smaller than in most Vietnamese restaurants, which is a good thing actually - it makes ordering easier, and the simple menu is displayed in 2 screens just over the counter. They do serve Asian shaved ice and milk teas, which is definitely a plus. The food is tasty, full of the refreshing savory-herbal flavors characteristic of the cuisine - and inexpensive, which is an important consideration for me. Another bonus: WiFi is available!
4558	1	a	Yum, yum and YUM! The spring rolls with pork and shrimp are amazing, and the Banh Mi are GREAT! I got the grilled pork and it didn't disappoint! It was fast, the service is wonderful and the place is really cute! I'll definitely go back.
4559	1	a	Excellent!  Highly recommended!\n\nI rated this 4 stars because it begins to look suspicious when all of the reviews are 5 stars.
4560	1	a	Best Happy Hour in Ahwatukee. Keep the DJ,  great ambiance. Very simple and delicious rolls. The hibachi crudo is delightful and I suspect that all crudo options are the same. \n\nStop putting random rocks from the rock decor around the driftwood on the plates. That's just weird.
4561	1	a	love the vibes here. glad stingray came to chandler. the sushi selection around this area is subpar, stingray is going to change that! great happy hour and Sun day specials. I'm enjoying a whiskey right now. Noah and alyssa are awesome. great service! this will now be my local spot
4562	0	a	"The receptionist is horribly rude!  It wasnt only me that noticed but others were complaining about her as, well. The other thing is when potential patients walked in they would  blurt out very loudly \""what insurance do you have\"" instead of how can I help you, whst are you here for?! And then they sit there and talk about the patient's insurance companies and whether it medicaid or not. Omg isnt this some kind HIPPA  violation?  Horrible horrible customer service.  I though this could be a painless trip with 2 sick kids since their pediatrician is completely booked.  The only good experience was after we were called back. The doctor was very nice."
4563	1	a	Ok maybe I am not allowed to write a review yet because I did get a free meal today during the soft opening with a flyer that came from American Express, but I have made reservations for dinner later this week and for a Holiday party in December.  That should tell you how good it was.  \n\nThe decor is beautiful wood grained and black with the bonefish accents tastefully arranged throughout the restaurant.  A really big beautiful one on the main dining room.  The wait staff is enthusiastic, friendly and while there were a few minor glitches, they were quickly remedied.  And hey, they haven't even really opened yet.  The 17th is the first day.\n\nThe Bang Bang Shrimp appetizer, is a must order!  Enough to share with 3 or 4.\n\nI had the Sea Bass with mango salsa and it was perfectly cooked and really was sea bass.  I'm sure everyone knows that the name on the menu does not always equate to what comes out on the plate, particularly when they say sea bass.  This was perfectly cooked - moist, tender, and flakey.  It had a beautiful sear and the salsa had large chunks of mango with red onion and a bit of spice, and was most definitely sea bass, not an immitation.   It was served with spaghetti squash that was well prepared and I chose couscous as the side dish, which was surprisingly good.\n\nMy friend had the Salmon, also with the mango salsa and shared a bit with me.  It was perfectly seared and her side was broccoli.  Big bright green beautiful florets.\n\nThe creme Br\u00fbl\u00e9e dessert was creamy, with a windowpane of fired sugar and was big enough to share.\n\nI am sorry I did not take pictures for you.  I guess you will just have to go over there yourself and see.  Thank goodness bonefish grill finally came to Madison and we can pretend we are in Florida while the snow flies.  This is the best seafood I have had in Wisconsin.
4564	1	a	Great dinner...portions a bit small but VERY flavorful! Seated us promptly, service was good and environment was comfortable.\n\nAdditionally both the front of house manager and GM came to our table to see how things were and gave us a box of custom chocolate once they found out it was my birthday.\n\nThe best touch was that they served sample appetizers to people waiting to be seated...classy.\n\nOverall, a must eat at restaurant!
4565	1	a	I was beyond excited to discover there would be a Bonefish Grill opening in Madison. In the past, I've had to travel 45-50 to Brookfield, WI to dine at one of my favorites restaurants. YAY! That will no longer be the case.\n\nThankfully we made reservations earlier in the week for 8pm on a Saturday. When my boyfriend and I arrived, there was quite the wait. However, we were seated within 3-5 minutes. We were warmly greeted by the hosts and I believe to be either the owner or the GM. Friendly staff creating a pleasant environment.\n\n\nOff the bat, we ordered the Bang-Bang Shrimp as an appetizer. I am in love with these shrimp. The bang-bang shrimp is lightly fried then covered in I believe to be a thousand island dressing. The shrimp are nicely stacked on a top of fresh greens. This would be a fantastic entree to be honest. If they make this an entr\u00e9e menu item, I would surely buy it. If you're not into trying any of their apps, don't worry, fresh bread, butter and garlic olive oil comes with every meal. \n\nFor drinks, I had (two) of their winter white cosmopolitans. Oh my goodness!!! This was off the chain! I absolutely loved how they add that extra kick by giving you 3 fresh cranberries which floats around in your drink. Their winter white cosmo is such great seasonal cocktail. My intentions were to just have one but I could not resist getting another!\n \nFor my entree, I ordered the fish and chips. My fries were a bit salty and honestly, I didn't get the portion I am use to. However, considering I was pretty full from the bread and bang-bang shrimp, it was not too big of a deal for me to complain. I would just say they can really cut back on the salt content. \n\nAs for dessert, we ordered the fan favorite chocolate cr\u00e8me brulee. I am not a huge fan of cr\u00e8me brulee but this one REALLY blew me away. Chocolate was fresh and creamy. \n\nThe opening of Bonefish Grill may be the reason why a particular restaurant (who shall remain nameless but resides in West Towne Mall) may go out of business. They offer everything you could ever want from nice restaurant for a nice couple outing. While they do cater to kids, I find them to be more of an adult type restaurant; however, that is just my opinion. \n\n\nThe one down side is they are not very big which could be a cause for the long wait times. Tables are pretty close to other tables, especially around the bar area. That being said, it is highly recommended that you make reservations or you may find yourself waiting up to 2 hours ( as I was told by one of the hostess who said the previous night, there was a 2 hour wait) just to get a table. They do have two private dining rooms so if you're looking to host some event, definitely look Bonefish Grill up. I was truly impressed with how well they were operating considering it was their first week of being open. Sure there were some wrinkles that needed to be ironed out, but considering how well they were handling the crowd, it was very well organized by the GM. I will be a regular customer for sure.
4566	1	a	I returned for my second trip in a week with a party of 6. Everyone ordered something different so I had the pleasure of seeing and tasting more dishes. The lobster fried rice is out of this world good! The lobster bisque was fresh and flavorful. This is being said by someone who does not care for lobster and I would certainly order both dishes. \n\nI ordered the basil fettucinni with salmon. It had a bit of a citrus flavor. Just a tad bit too much, however, I added some cracked pepper on top to calm down the flavor and it helped. Dish was still great.\n\n\nAnd of course, the bang bang shrimp were still bangin'! \n\nWhat would make this a 5 star would be adding more to their menu. It's fairly small. That being said, I do think there is a payoff to that which is better quality food with smaller ticket times. Larger menus can make this a bit problematic. Still, adding more variety of seafood, maybe some steaks and one additional kind of burger along with their Kobe burger would be ideal in my opinion. \n\nI will be a regular diner.
4567	0	a	I went to Bonefish Grill about a week ago.  The reason for my late review is that I've been sick ever since.  I got the worst case of food poisoning that I've ever had in my life.  I'm talking three to five days of vomiting,chills etc.  The worst!  It was like the never ending hangover.  I will never go back to this place and I only hope they didn't ruin my palate for seafood since I love the stuff. \n\nAbout my food. I ordered the dumplings.  Not bad, not great.  I got a salmon that was so blackened it shrunk into the size of a business card.  Do not...I repeat..do not order the crab fried rice!!!  It is only some fried rice, with a ton of eggs, with a few sprinkles of crab.  Total rip off.  The specials for the night sounded good but the execution just wasnt there.  I'm not sure what is up with the side of what I think is spaghetti squash (plus the seeds, yuk). It looked like an overload of a garnish.  The food was very disappointing and not to mention over priced!  Getting sick as a dog and feeling like I was going to die the first night was just a HUGE slap in the face.  Never again, Bonefish!
4568	0	a	Hi, I just ate here for the first time. I found a new restaurant with a lot of bugs to iron out.\n\nIt's pretty clear that the wait staff are very inexperienced as were the hostesses.\n\nThe food we ordered was sub par and if not for JD, one of the owners there, I would not have considered ever going back. JD is the right guy to turn the place around so I'm gong to go back in about a month to give it another try. They have only been open for a few weeks and they deserve the time to get it right. I really believe JD will get it done.
4569	0	a	"My boyfriend and I met my parents here for dinner. I was about an hour late and walked in to my parents still having not received drinks. We waited another half hour before flagging down a host who didn't do anything either but apologize. A manager ended up coming over and getting a waitress for us. Almost 2 hours after my parents got there, drinks and appetizers were served. The table next to us also had a really long wait before getting their drinks. This was the case with the tables by the bar and behind us too. The food is great and they tried to make the wait right by offering a free appetizer and drinks, which is the only redeeming quality to this review. With better service, this place would receive 5 stars easily, but if it doesn't improve, this place sadly won't be around for long.\nEDITED: the check came and they ended up charging us for the \""free\"" appetizer and drinks."
4570	0	a	"I wanted to like this, but was very disappointed.  Reservations for 5:45, didn't get seated until 6:15 & only after talking twice to the hostess.  My Cabernet was served chilled for some reason, service was extremely slow & food was just ok.  Lobster bisque was good & the husbands liked their steaks, but overall presentation & flavors were very \""chain-like\""."
4571	0	a	Made an online reservation. When we arrived the place was packed. Navigated our way to the hostess and tried to confirm our reservation. The hostess asked if we made the reservation online, and when I said yes, they said that they were having problems with the online reservation service making reservations for their Madison, MS establishment instead (which is what happened) but they said they'd get us right in. Thirty five minutes later we were still waiting. People wandering in after us with no reservation were served first. Thirty five minutes is too long. Sorry. Have no idea what the food tastes like. Better luck next time.
4572	0	a	We loved the decor, and the food is probably great, but we didn't eat there. We left after 40 minutes of waiting to be seated, even though we had made a reservation. Terrible service and not very friendly hostesses. What a waste of time ... and we'd had such high hopes for this place.
4573	0	a	Our daughter wanted to go to Bonefish for her birthday. We had reservations on a Sunday evening but still waited for a table for 15 minuets. The only good thing about the evening was the Bang Bang Shrimp appetizers. All 6 of our dinners were average at best. The portions were small and only slightly warm, the service was very slow, and the staff seemed very disorganized. We will continue to visit our locally owned restaurants in the futures, Enough with the chain restaurants already!
4574	1	a	"Very tasty. Had the Ahi Tuna Steak cooked medium. Spectacular. Got the truffle mac for a side and was not disappointed. Waitress had wonderful recommendations for sides and drinks for the ladies.\n\nNot a huge tap beer selection but I'm sure they'll get their crap together after demand for them goes up. \""Premium\"" beer list has Spotted Cow, Blue Moon, and one other tap I couldn't remember.\n\nNo line at 730 on Tuesday night. Will probably be very busy for a while being so new."
4575	0	a	They did not take our number when ordering take out, so when we got there we were told one of our entrees wasn't available. It took more than 15 minutes for them to then tell us to pick something else off the menu (which was comped). They also gave us a card for a free shrimp app for next time. We waited at the bar for the food to be prepared, which took almost 40 minutes. The bar was half empty and yet it took nearly 15 minutes to get a drink. Everything is very slow and I'm surprised they didn't make it a priority to get the new item out fast. When we got home the rest of the food was obviously stone cold, the food just average tasting and the portions extremely small. Will not be back to say the least. Hope for their sake they figure out how to run the restaurant smoother.
4576	0	a	Food was decent, service was horrible.  Bar service was incredibly slow; servers both in the bar area and the dining room seemed like they had never worked in a restaurant before;  they lacked basic service skills; they seemed very uncomfortable waiting on the public. I'll give the restaurant another try in a few months...
4577	0	a	Surprisingly poor service for a well reputed, upper end chain.  Our party of 4 had a reservation and were promptly seated, but waited 30 minutes for the wine. After asking twice, the bottle was delivered and comped. The meals arrived over 1 hour after we were seated.  The food preparation was good although the fish portions were about 1/3 small for the price.  Seafood portions at comparable restaurants are larger at this price point, either locally or per our experience on the east coast. It made me wonder if they were stretching the supply since it was New Year's Eve.\n\n  Our server never checked on us after ordering.  Someone else delivered the meals (including an attempt to deliver another table's meal to us). We had to find her to take a dessert order but the one we wanted had been exhausted by then.\n\nThese service issues were not expected of this chain, which apparently does not have uniform procedures or hiring practices.  Our server did not have basic skills for the job at this level.  We may return in 6-12 months if the reviews improve.
4578	1	a	Very good food.  Kitchen still seems to be working it out. Ordered entree with lemon butter sauce and had to ask twice for it to come out. Also asked for side on separate plate as one of us is vegetarian and entree was not. They missed it, which is fine, but the awesome bartenders had to go back twice to get it fixed. Good bar.  Awesome ice glass blackberry cocktail.  Great wine list    \nGood bartenders.  Hopefully they work out a few kinks. We'll go back.  Food overall was very good and priced right.
4579	0	a	El stinko!\nThey had my favorite wine by the glass. Tasted like it had been open too long. No water brought to table. Had bread with no napkins....waited over an hour for a table in the bar. Waitress not familiar with the menu. Out of Mahi Mahi. Ordered shrimp and scallops...came cold on a warm plate minus the side. Sent it back and it took another 20 minutes to get it. They brought the spaghetti squash on the side and it was still steaming from the microwave. Manager bought us a round of drinks. I've been to Bonefish in Florida. VERY different experience here. I'll give them a couple of months to figure it out and then 1 more try. Bummer that I wasted my gift card here:(
4580	0	a	Wasn't anything I would return for.
4581	1	a	We went there for lunch and were impressed.  Our service was friendly and prompt and the food was good.  I wish they had a larger menu but we were satisfied.
4582	0	a	Woah I was disappointed. Lets start with the reservations. We made them for 6:30 and finally got out table at 7:05. Lets chalk it up to new restaurant jitters.\n\nGot to table took 12 minutes for server to come over and say hi.  Lets chalk it up to new restaurant jitters.\n\nWe placed our orders and all seemed ok now. \n\nOnce food arrived my whole fish tasted awesome! yeah had over 25 bones in it. not little ones but big ones. Horrible prep job.  Lets chalk it up to new restaurant jitters.\n\nOther food portions were smaller but taste was ok. Not sure value for portion size was quite there but either way ok. \n\nOrdered Dessert. Serve who had been asking about dessert since 3 min after entrees were placed dropped of dessert and check at same time which is ok but before I could even get a fork full of dessert was back to collect payment for the check. Seemed kind of rushed but she was very friendly.  Lets chalk it up to new restaurant jitters.\n\nSo it was ehh but not worth the over $120 check for the 4 of us. (No drinks)\n\nI did call at about 9 to inform the manager of our few issues. I kid you not the hostess on the phone said she thought they were to busy to talk to a customer but would check if I really wanted her to. Serious a manager who didnt have time for a guest. I even identified myself and the reason I was calling.  Lets chalk it up to new restaurant jitters.\n\nWell with all those new restaurant jitters I am not sure I wish to revisit this chain. I would expect a chain to have a few less issues and to be available to review this type of experience.
4583	1	a	"This is a nice new location inside the downtown summerlin mall.  Ive been here 2 times since it opened. Both times were enjoyable... No employees outside asking every passer by if they want to try the tea (I know this is their job but I hate it! Maybe because I've probably tasted that and every other tea before? Maybe it just reminds me of those mall kiosks \""ma'm let me see your hair!\"") \nThey're really nice and knowledgeable about pulling teas to try once they get a vibe of what you like... Ive gotten free iced teas brewed while I shop (although be warned I don't think they do this if you're buying like 10 bucks... both times I was restocking in the $80+ range).  They also haven been super pushy with buying the extra tin to keep your teas super fresh or buying rock sugar.  \nMinus one star for intentionally pouring more tea than I asked for (they sell by the ounce) and not asking if it was ok... I mean I asked for four oz. and the guy pours 5.5oz... its typically 5-15 dollars per 2oz. so keep your eye on the scale!"
4584	0	a	If there were 0 stars I would give that. I told a manager named Marino that I bought a Breville water kettle a few days back. He told me I should have got the $25 gift card with purchase and was surprised I did not get it. He said to bring back my receipt and he would give me the $25 gift card. \n\nSo I did what he said, I went back and got my receipt and when I went back to the store the same day he said that the $25 gift card was for a different machine. Well, wouldn't it be great customer service to ask which machine I got and be more specific if it were only certain machines that offered the $25 gift card? The entire situation would have never happened if he did asked just one simple question so that I would not waste my time coming back in the after Christmas chaos and crowds just to do what he promised me. I think this is careless and shows how much they devalue their customers. To me it is not about the $25, it is the principle that he offered information to me and then just dismissed the information he had just given me with no sincerity or care about the effort I made to do what he informed me to do. I don't appreciate people wasting my time and not seeming to care at all about what they said that was incorrect information. \n\nWhat made things worse is when he sold me a tea which he claimed was excellent. I went home and took less than a teaspoon full because it actually did not appeal to me the more I smelled it. I mixed it with another tea to make a cup and threw it away. It was gross! I went back to return it and he rang me up for 3.5 oz when I bought 4 oz. How is it possible that I used .5 oz on one cup of tea when supposedly they claim 2 ounces is 20 plus cups of tea meaning .5 oz should be at least 5 servings?\n\nIt would have been a nice gesture as someone who suggested the tea and just made me drive to Teavana once out of my way just to bring a receipt and got nothing for it and now twice to return a tea he recommended. It would have been kind to return the amount I bought due to the amount of time and money I put into doing something by coming back and got nothing out of it. I came back because he assured me he would help me when I return. Instead he just said it's for a different tea maker and did nothing to apologize for my time he wasted and my gas money. I think that's a pretty awful way to take care of the situation. I would be more understanding if it's someone new, but a manager should know better!\n\nI truly believe he scammed me and overcharged me for the tea and said it was 4 ounces when it wasn't. That is the only logical explanation. He also made mistakes with my other tea. It was crowded in there and everyone makes mistakes, but they should fix them when it is brought to their attention. \n\nUnfortunately he has ruined my love for Teavana. This person is someone they put in management? Not the kind of company I want to give my hard earned money on. I don't want to pay to be treated that way.
4585	1	a	I was just driving down Eastern and I couldn't believe they have a brand new Fabulous Eyebrow Threading place by the Firefly. I love their service. Best eyebrow threading chain in the valley. And now they are in Henderson too. So Awesome!
4586	1	a	Mona is ahhhmazing and totally sweet! This place has great customer service and the ladies have skills. Mona always does my eyebrows right and takes her time! She has great attention to detail and she listens to what I need. I love this place!
4587	1	a	These people are phenomenal. I used to go to their Durango location and this new location much closer to my work and I just walk in today. I never disappointed the way they do threading and they always use the same thread and technique. My eyebrows are harder to work with and I never trust waxing on my eyebrows bcos I don't have very many to loose. That case threading is the best option and I always trust fabulous eyebrow threading. Also, this place like little boutique those you can buy brand name purses and jewelries.
4588	1	a	Found this hidden Jem through yelp and it was well worth the visit. As soon as i walked in to the store, I had a nice welcoming treat with cold bottle of water and warm cup of coffee. Ideal touch for the cold weather and immediately sat with the nice girl ( threader) to do my eyebrows. Believe me I got most accurate eyebrows I ever want in my life and it was almost painless. I was really happy that I found fabulous eyebrow threading here in anthem area and most definitely this is to go place after having greatest experience. Thank you Yelp! Made my life happier.
4589	1	a	I have been going to the Durango location for over a year now and I wouldn't trust any other place with my eyebrows! They come out perfect every single time. It's great that they opened up this new location on this side of town which is much closer to get to after work. Go here, you won't be disappointed!
4590	1	a	Found this place on yelp and just want to stop by bcos my brows getting out of control. When I was getting two people ahead of me and the wait was les than 10 minutes. Did my eyebrows and lip for $9.00 that first time $5 deal applied to my service. Wow!! What great experience and now I know where to go. Thank you fabulous eyebrow threading.!!!
4591	1	a	This was my first time getting my eyebrows done here and I'm will now never go anywhere else. Muna  did my eyebrows on a Sunday evening and she did a perfect job. They use organic cotton which made it hurt a little less. Great price, great service, great job. Will definitely be coming back.
4592	1	a	A Chipotle even closer to me!  We ordered to go and I noticed that you can even order online. There was no one there probably because no one realizes that it's opened yet but it is!\n\nWe ordered the usual...a chicken burrito and a Barbacoa bowl. They put a bunch of meat in my bowl but not enough rice which is fine. My meat was a bit on the dry side but I'm sure they are still working out the kinks. Overall it's still one of my favorite semi fast food places.
4593	0	a	I came in on my lunch break and customer service was good. I ordered my food and went down the line but when I got to the cash register I noticed the girl behind the counter clearly had full blown pink eye. I work in childcare and know exactly what it looks like and this was not just a little irritation. Pink eye is HIGHLY contagious and she should have been sent home immediately when her supervisor saw her even if they were under staffed. That was just a complete turn off for me. Honestly I wasn't hungry after that but from the looks of my food I wasn't impressed anyway. Should have gone to Qdoba.
4594	1	a	She didn't have pink eye. She just had eye surgery. She slept on her contact lence and it tore a layer from her eye. It doesn't hurt to ask before we judge.
4595	0	a	I gave this 2 stars because that's how much I love chipotle. But when it comes to this new location, the employees here are not even trained to wrap a burrito yet. Minimum 15 min wait when you go inside and they laugh and joke with each other instead of hopping on the food line and giving extra help. Hire more people and train them to do everything before you open a new location. Writing this as I wait in line (been 10 min)
4596	1	a	I ate several times here. Every time the restaurant surprised me. All chef specials are amazing, and I enjoyed dim sum like pot stickers and mini buns. It tastes like real Chinese food since I come from China.
4597	1	a	Without a doubt, the best program I've worked with. The support, when requested, is nothing short of first class!
4598	1	a	Very friendly over the phone and in person. Lloyd showed up less then 30 minutes from the time i made the call. He was professional and friendly.
4599	1	a	I just got a Quinoa Stuffed Avocado and added Roasted Chicken to go. It was literally one of the most amazing things I've ever eaten. Huge portion too. I'm trying to decide if it would be weird to go back for dinner. Can't wait to try the rest of the menu. The place smells like heaven too when you walk in. Only complaint, I thought some items were kinda pricey. My meal came to $10.75 and it's on the app menu. But whatever, it was so good it's worth it.
4600	1	a	Amazing food and great service as always!\nTried their alfajores cookies today and the tres leches cake ! \nThe alfajores cookie is good, it has a dulce de leche filling, the cookie is crumbly and has a toffee taste. I would rate it a 3/5.\nThe tres leches cake however is amazing, it's sweet ,creamy and moist, it tastes like heaven ! It's so good,OMG! I could not get enough of it ! \n\nViva Chicken is the best!!!!
4601	1	a	It took me a little while to go in here... It's very close to my house, and therefore dangerous.\n\nThose quinoa stuffed avocados though.... Amazing. It's the only thing I've had so far because I can't not order them.  The first time I got them I didn't change them at all, but I always add chicken. I think the balsamic is a little overwhelming, so now I order it without. And it's so good! I can't even explain it. Just the right size, filling, but about $10. So it is a little pricey, but delicious. \n\nThe people are always very friendly and helpful here. It's a clear your own table kind of place, but someone always offers to take my plate for me and refills my little water cup.
4602	0	a	It's fine if you're looking for a flavorless greasy, beef patty. But if it's an umami overload you want, I recommend Burgatory. The apps are spot on! But the burgers lack seasoning.
4603	0	a	After a two hour wait, a mediocre meal. Good appetizers, but salmon burger was bland and burgers greasy. Server was the best part of our dinner.
4604	0	a	The appetizers were good.   I am not sure what DJ is talking about. This place is a poor knock off of Burgatory.   The burger options are limited and I agree with a previous poster,  somewhat flavorless.   If you want a great burger go to Burgatory. In a pinch this place will do for appetizers. \n\nThe other thing that was lacking was service.   We actually had to go get our server to get our iced teas refilled, even though she checked on the table next us every five minutes. She never once checked on us until we went and asked her for refills.
4605	0	a	"Better burger options in the burgh.\n\n-The hostess told us there was going to be a 15 minute wait (there were at least 3 visible empty tables in the main area). She ended up having to track us down in the mall seating area after a half hour because \""something went wrong with their texting system\"". \n\n- Our waitress came by shortly after we were seated and took our drink order. My wife got a diet and I order a coke. We both received diet. Not a huge deal for me but I could tell the mostly high school student staff wasn't experienced. \n\n-Ordered the grilled cheese bites appetizer, it was literally a grilled cheese sandwich cut in fourths. Not even an overly good sandwich at that. \n\n-My wife ordered a \""make your own burger.\"" the waitress asked no questions (such as how she would like her burger cooked) nor did she repeat her order to make sure it was correct. Her burger was marked as being cooking medium well but it was extremely dry. \n\n-The only issue I had with my meal were the Cajun tater tots. They were just frozen tots with a heavy dusting of Cajun powder on them. \n\n-Overall, for a lunch that was pretty costly I was disappointed. If you are looking for a good burger in Pittsburgh, try out Burgatory or Wingharts before this place."
4606	0	a	Worst burger I've ever had to pay for! No seasoning on this very very dry burger and was also poorly constructed. 30+ dollars for two hamburgers and ala carte potato salad. Worst lunch in south hills.
4607	0	a	Was really hoping that this place would be on par with Butgatory, but the burger I had was really bland. In fact it reminds me why I generally don't order burgers. The fries were mediocre (dry, somewhat stale and equally flavorless). The waitstaff was unimpressive, as well. The only positive was that there's a decent selection of beers on draft. \n\nIn addition, the atmosphere was pretty weak. The chairs were uncomfortable and people are somewhat crammed into the restaurant. \n\nVery disappointed. Was really hoping to see a restaurant come in into that space that would last, but I wouldn't be surprised if they're closed within a year based on my experience.
4608	0	a	Well not such a big fan of Apple any more, I am now in the market for an Android! I have paid over $100 a month for over 13 months. Today I awake and my iphone does not turn on. I use this phone as a business phone, and I thought Apple would handle the problem. First of all Shandra & Scott! I dont even know what the hell a Jail Break phone is, or whatever the hell you inquired about, I just know I walked out feeling really insulted and never received the assistance I deserved after using your product for over 13 months. Each employee in our company uses apple products, now there will definitely be changes coming.
4609	0	a	Just went to get my phone replaced as I am within the year of Apple care and my phone's screen is literally popping off (always have a case on it, but it's still coming apart). I spoke to ANGIE asking if she could just replace it for me, as I have everything backed up on iCloud and wouldn't require any assistance beyond the replacement of the phone itself. She replied that she was too busy for me right then and that I could come back in two days. TWO DAYS! I was shocked at how she was too busy to just walk the phone to the back room and retrieve a new one, when she was literally just staring into her iPad. I'm so disappointed, you would think that such a successful company would value its customers more:(
4610	0	a	"I've been to Apple stores all over the US, in Seattle, Florida, Denver, Las Vegas. This store is, hands down, the worst. I strongly advise one of the other Apple stores in Vegas. For whatever reason, this one seems particularly poorly managed.\n\nFirst, it's freezing cold in January 2015 and there's no mall, the place is outside! This is apparently to maximize exposure to extreme temperatures in both winter and summer.  Crazy.  \n\nThe most disappointing part is that the place is ALWAYS understaffed. There's always a wait to buy whatever you're looking for, at least in my experience. Wait times vary from 15 to 45 minutes. Ive never been to an Apple store where there was a wait of more than a few minutes. I don't ever recall it being an issue. \n\nRegrettably, some of the staff have surly attitudes. The guy who explained the wait repeatedly offered the following explanation, \""Yes, there's always a wait when we're busy.\"" Really?? Why?? Is it really that difficult to correctly staff a small retail store? Maybe McDonalds can offer some useful pointers on business management and basic staffing ratios.  The DMV staffing model doesn't work in private business. \n\nThe place seems to be chaotic and the few staff around seem to try to avoid eye contact. There seems to be a general lack of maturity to the entire place. The staff seems more interested in giving complex tutorials to people who want to play, rather than ringing up customers who want to BUY.  I saw the head red-shirt give a five-minute explanation to a woman who wanted to know where the bathroom was. I had to chase him around the store to make an \""appointment\"" to buy an iPhone. We wont be back to this craptastic Apple Store."
4611	1	a	I love McAlister's Deli and it's great to have one nearby. The kids meals are only 99 cents every day, which means my family, which includes four kids, can eat here for under $20! The food is delicious, the sweet tea is the best in town, and it has a great lunch atmosphere for casual or business lunches. Highly recommended.
4612	1	a	Excellent service. Great food. I got the Chipotle Chicken Sandwhich. The food arrived in less than 5 minutes and the staff checked on my drink three times during the 20 minutes I was in there.
4613	0	a	No way will I return here. Underwhelmed right from the start. Mumbling order taker that sounded like she needed to take a nap. \nMy wife order her sandwich with no tomato, but it had tomato on it. I had salad with chicken, but there was only 3 slivers of chicken. The food was bland.  The only reason for the 2nd star was because the place was clean. I give this place 6 months before it closes. It's more like a sandwich shop than a deli.
4614	1	a	The food here is phenomenal!!! Makes Jason's Deli taste like Subway. I'm working on the whole menu and have yet to be disappointed. My favorite so far is the Big Nasty. You must try their sweet teas. Kids meals without a drink are only $0.99!!! The manager, Cody, is extremely friendly and it reflects on his staff. The service exceeds expectation.
4615	1	a	We went here new years eve and it was so good! The two girls behind the counter were AWESOME and took the time to explain the menu and offered lots of suggestions on the best items to order. I ordered the French dip with a side of macaroni and cheese and the sweet tea.\nThe food was delicious and very reasonably priced. We paid $15 for two sandwiches with sides and our two large glasses of water plus my tea.\nWe were checked on multiple times during our meal and the customer service is definitely one of the many reasons we'll return.\nDefinitely recommend giving this place a try!
4616	1	a	Yay! First! Been going to senor taco in fountain hills and i didn't mind the 25 minute drive because they have the best carne Asada burrito in the valley. However i always wanted them to open one closer to home and they finally did!  It was pretty obvious they have not been open for long. Salsa was fresh,  and burro was delicious but the size was smaller than the ones in fountain hills. Right next to DD, I will be visiting here often :)
4617	1	a	We needed a quality Mexican restaurant and it's finally here. The Diablo shrimp was to die for. Great fried fish tacos. Salsa with both flavor and heat. Welcome senior ... We have been waiting for you!
4618	1	a	This is legit barbecue  Now everyone has their own preference for bbq.  I can see how people who want A LOT of smoke flavor in their meat might find this a little underpowered.  I'm one who thinks smoke should accent and not dominate bbq.\n\nThe meat here is really excellent.  Chopped brisket, pulled pork, and pulled chicken all on the menu now and possibly hot links in the future.  Good quality bread on the sandwiches and a couple variety of bbq sauces.  The two sauces I had were both tasty.  \n\nBrisket had a nice flavor.  Beefy with enough of the brisket fat to make it rich and delicious.  I thought the pulled pork might have done with a little more fat but it was still excellent stuff.  Talked to the owner a bit and there's a meticulousness there that makes me believe this place will get better and better.  And, unlike some other bbq places in town, you won't have to worry about inconsistent quality here.  Everything is clean and just what you expect.\n\nDefinitely recommend you try it out if you like bbq.
4619	1	a	Wife took me here for lunch the other day. WOW. Only had the tacos (2 pulled pork, and 1 brisket) and wow the flavors and the hint of spice to give it a bit of kick were awesome. Giving 4 start based off that one meal but will be back to update after I have eaten there a couple more times. Excellent first visit.
4620	1	a	Went in and tried the pork rib and fatty brisket and it was pretty good. I generally don't care for pork ribs but it literally fell off the bone and was very moist and juicy. The brisket has just enough fat and was very flavorful. \n\nThey had 3 different kinds of bbq sauces sweet, smokey and a white thunder. The sweet is a typical bbq sauce, smokey was my favorite and white thunder was pretty much just heat. \n\nPrices are pretty much standard to other bbq places starting around $8. Since this is closer to my job I'd definitely go back.
4621	1	a	Billy asked me if I wanted lean or fatty slices on my brisket.    It's almost like a trick question.   The answer is yes.
4622	1	a	We were actually headed to Fuddrucker's when we saw this place and decided to try it...glad we did! We ordered the 3 meat plate with brisket, pulled pork, and pulled chicken. We chose baked beans, mac n' cheese, and cornbread for our sides. Everything was delicious!  All of the meats were very tender and flavorful. The sides were very good too. 2 of us shared the meal, and it was plenty. The BBQ master even came out to check on us. I heard they have free soft serve ice cream cones for dessert, but we were too stuffed to indulge!  I would rather eat BBQ from a place like this than one of the chain restaurants any day! It's a long drive for us from Henderson, but well worth it. We will be back!
4623	0	a	This place is on par with airport restaurants. They know you can't really go anywhere else so there is no hurry to serve you and the food doesn't have to be affordable because you only eat there when you really have to. Consequently, I only eat here when I really have to.
4624	0	a	Firstly,  the two women students who currently work here are fine.  Anything that is lacking in their training is not their fault,  and they are perfectly nice.  I think they do their best,  and sometimes go above and beyond to be friendly. \n\nThat being said,  Charlies consistently provides some of the worst coffee and customer service I have ever experienced at a coffee shop.  The only reason I ever purchase anything at Charlies is out of absolute desperation. \n\nI'm constantly amazed at how bad the coffee is.  They use a  decent brand for beans,  so either the beans are old or the espresso and coffee machines have never been cleaned.  The drinks taste bitter and burned in a way even the darkest roast should not.  It is worse than break room coffee at a government job (which is to say that it is also worse than no coffee). \n\nThe fresh pastries are average,  and I appreciate the effort to have gluten free and vegetarian meals.  I have never had any of the sandwiches so I cannot speak to all of the food.  It would be wonderful to have some healthier snacks but that is probably asking too much. \n\nThe service is the true reason for the single star.  I cannot understand why there is only one person working during their busiest hours.  It regularly takes more than 15 minutes to get through a 3 person line,  and that does not count the time it takes to get your drink. Some of the employees are very rude,  and sneer at simple requests like for hot water or ice in your personal cup. Other employees who are more courteous are constantly overwhelmed by the amount of customers during peak hours. \n\nOh,  and the hours? Who knows what the are. I think they close at four, which is way too early for a LAW SCHOOL coffee shop where caffeine is in higher demand than adderall. \n\nWhen I have more than 10 minutes I always walk to Starbucks,  Dutch Brothers, The Well or any other place.  \n\nOk enough.
4625	0	a	I agree with the other reviewers regarding the coffee.\n\nBut - also why must people buying a bottle of water wait so long? The barista should be making quick sales before making a full meal or latte for another customer....or get another barista to run the register.\n\nIts annoying that you have to wait in a really long line just to buy a bottle of water.
4626	0	a	O Charlie's. I keep going to you out of convenience but I keep being consistently disappointed. The female workers are lovely people with whom I enjoy chatting. But the service is completely terrible. Only one person working at 3 p.m.? I have counted 15 people in line at one time. I think most businesses would recognize this as a problem and act to fix it! Not Charlie's....\n\nAdditionally, burnt coffee, burnt espresso, burnt milk! If the coffee and food were on par with the high prices, it might be okay. However it's the whole combination of bad food, bad service, and TERRIBLE COFFEE that makes me frustrated with this coffee place.
4627	0	a	"Sandwiches and pastries are fine grab-and-go food, but the food is completely over-priced. Of course, convenience will drive up prices but its gotten a little ridiculous.\n\nDespite these semi-high prices, the service completely ruins any positive attributes of the cafe. My first year at the law school (2012-2013), the baristas were excellent, providing efficient and quality service. Obviously, Charlie's just lucked out with the two main baristas during that year. Its apparent that they have not even attempted to adequately train their workers or adequately staff this cafe with enough workers to handle the demand. This leads to high wait times, terrible service, and \""hangry\"" (ahem, administration that means hungry plus angry) law students. \n\nNeeds improvement pronto!"
4628	0	a	I don't drink coffee so I can't speak to their particular cup of joe.  However, I've eaten their twice: Once for a sandwich and one a muffin.  The sandwich was subpar.  The muffin was pretty good.  White chocolate something-or-other.  \n\nIt's not that Charlie's has personally offended me or anything - it's just that I would prefer almost any other restaurant in existence to inhabit that spot instead of Charlie's.  If I'm forced to grab a snack in the law building, Charlie's is it.  The vending machines never take my debit card (idk why) so I'm forced to eat an overpriced, ok muffin.  It's unfortunate.  At any given restaurant I can at least find one item that's not too expensive that I like.  Not Charlie's.  It's an anomaly.
4629	1	a	Finally! Perfect moist delicious and beautiful macaron in Arizona !!  \n\nThese were good size , tastey and well presented ( and presentation is big part of macaron) .\n\nMy favorite macaron and will be back for more for me... And for gifts ! Perfect!
4630	1	a	This place is amazing! The first MacarOn Caf\u00e9 on the west coast and they chose Scottsdale. They are to die for and at a great price for the quality as well! The handmade detail put into each colorful all natural MacarOn with the perfect texture and flavorful inside make them a treat any day of the year!!! \n\nBesides them all being hand made with natural ingredients, they are all GLUTEN FREE because the fluffy outside is masterfully crafted with Almond milk and Almond flour! They are all LOW calorie, as well as TRANS FAT FREE....which sets them at the top of the podium compared to all the others. The MacarOn flavours are always changing to with about 30 flavours always in stock that also rotate with the Season! \n\nIts a must to at least try one, but with a warning that you will become addicted...trust me! These MacarOns are MacarOning (Haha I just had too) me crazy!!!
4631	0	a	"What are these people talking about?! I must have gotten the wrong kind or came at the wrong time because my matcha green tea macarons (only ones left at about 4pm) were nasty - they were almost hard as a rock, almost couldn't chew through it. The filling was bitter. My bf said it tasted burnt. For a place called \""Macaron Cafe\"" I was expecting to be blown away but I was quite upset. Don't waste your money. This was the first time I've thrown macarons away. One star for the nice staff, free sample of slush (which wasn't good in my opinion) and for being appealing enough to reel me in to buy. But never again."
4632	1	a	I was told about this place by my co-worker and decided to try it.  The macarons I had tried at other place was not very good so I wasn't expecting too much.  Also, they only had the green tea macarons left so I was a bit disappointed.  But since I was there I decided to try the green tea and it was so much better than what I had expected.  It wasn't too sweet, could actually taste the green tea (a bit bitter but had a good aftertaste to it), and good chewy texture.  They are soooo good!!  So now I actually like macarons.  I'll try other flavors next time and post reviews.  And Spencer was super nice!!
4633	0	a	Tastes like ball sack (Green Tea).
4634	1	a	Great store! Very clean and well organized. There are two small tables in the back for Magic. Shopkeeper super friendly.
4635	0	a	My husband and I love Indian food and was very excited to find a place close to where we live. What a disappointment! The naan bread was actually pita bread, it looks store bought. The vegetable biryani was not fresh and steamed in an aluminum foil packet; it was not at all what we expected. We've experienced the wonderful, true, fresh Indian food and this is definitely not it.
4636	0	a	Worst restaurant I have ever seen in Phoenix. Pathetic taste and so stubborn to take any inputs or suggestions from the customers.
4637	0	a	"Adorable Burros- Horrible Customer Service\n\nI waited quite awhile before I wrote this review as I was severely irritated right after the incident..\nI contacted this business to inquire about their services on initially on 3-4-14. \n\nOn 5-20 I had worked out the logistics/ got the appropriate permissions from our wedding venue and told Vanessa that I would like to book two Burros. \n\nOne month before our wedding date I received an e-mail from Vanessa letting me know that they had me as a tentative hold and that they needed the contract finalized. Over the next couple days we worked out the specifics as far as timing would go. \n\nOn October 1st I received an e-mail from Vanessa saying that they had overbooked and would only have one Burro available- to try and make it right they offered us their \""photo option\"". \nOn October 5th Vanessa sent me a pay pal invoice and it and the contract were returned on the same day. \n\nThe day of the event came (10/18) and even though the Burros were my fianc\u00e9's \""groom gift\"" (When I initially spoke with Vanessa on the phone I let her know) he never got to see them.  \nFrom the day after the wedding(10/19) my fianc\u00e9 and I were traveling on our honeymoon and had very little internet access. (what internet  we did have was unsecure). \n\nWhen I got back to internet access I had no less than 6 e-mails with progressively rude comments from Vanessa letting me know that she had expected payment on the day of the event.  Shame on me for not getting it to her... though it would have been a lot easier to pay her IF I HAD SEEN HER. Good thing she left without us literally ever laying eyes on the burros. I have never left a bill unpaid in my entire life and considering that I paid her the deposit the day she sent the invoice she should have had a clue about my character. \n\nAs for the photo option- I am glad that I didn't pay for it.. We got approximately 50 photos with at least a quarter of the photos blurry/people not looking at the camera/the ground.. great stuff. Luckily a lot of guests took their own photos with their camera phones.\n\nWith all of that being said all of the guests loved the burros.... Good luck if you book with these people.\n\nEDITED TO RESPOND TO BUSINESS OWNER---\n\nVanessa,\n\nYou have got to be kidding me. You were unaware that I was unhappy with your service?? I told you that the whole reason we had the burros was for my husband to enjoy and you didn't bother to come see us (though you were asked to) and then you complained that I didn't pay you soon enough even though I let you know why...unbelievable (off the continent/ unsecured internet). You took down my photo gallery or I would link it here.  I am not sure how you counted 70 photos...(I cant help but notice all of the reviews you asked for from other customers feature a photo of them with the burro-- something we don't have). As for the six e-mails that appeared to come from you- I would be entirely happy to send you a screen shot if you would like. You were paid prior to the event.. half up front. I would be happy to forward you that e-mail if you would like as well.\n\nAs far as calling my wedding \""low budget and disorganized\""... you are a true class act lady. So sorry that we didn't get married at the Ritz. Lastly as far as \""being no where in sight\""- yes, as is traditional- we were taking photos. As outlined in the timeline- I requested from the burros be with us from 5- 5:15 so that we could see them/take photos.. that didn't happen. And the beer? You are correct- it wasn't where it was supposed to be--turns out delivery guys get a little lost when they deliver to a 92 acre facility (even with clear instructions).\n\nOver all I am just in awe that you went to the lengths to call our wedding low budget and disorganized.... true class ma'am, true class.\n\nThe point of my post? I was trying to give a clear understanding with timeline... the exact point though- LOVED the burros- the guests raved about them. The customer service was poor... further demonstrated by your response."
4638	0	a	Great food but flawed by poor service. \n\nI wanted to love this place, great location, interior, trendy, interesting menu. However the overall experience was very subpar. \n\nThere seemed to be around ten waiters and waitresses. Each time a different person would serve the table, resulting in confusion to the point where some dishes did not even arrive. No apologies given. \n\nWould probably visit again, but only once they settle in a bit more.
4639	1	a	The food here was excellent and the service was amazing. The menu choices are very interesting and full of taste. \n\nThe twists on Western food are descent and not too out there and the more traditional Izakaya is very good. I also like the choices they bring around on the Giridon. \n\nThe layout is modern Izakaya with lots of seats close together but still some separate seating for the less community oriented people. \n\nEveryone should try this place!
4640	1	a	Nikki is AWESOME and so was this event. The Blue Moon glasses are def going to be used and the #YelpEliteTowel as my Elite gift was unexpected and super soft. Ok, so on to the meat and potatoes.... The Improper Pig was my first Elite event and has set the bar extremely high.  I had no idea the hospitality of the fellow Yelpers would be so much like family.  The food was like tastebud ADD!  There were so many yummy things to taste and boy did I taste ALL of them!!!  NOM NOM.  I look forward to hanging out with everyone at more events in the future.
4641	1	a	"Another PERFECT Charlotte Elite Event.  Nikki and her crew have this thing down!  From start to finish, it was a wonderful evening.  Added benefit - being able to donate canned goods to a great cause.\n\nThe staff at \""The Pig\"" were wonderful.  My server was one of the best.  Just a fantastic customer service skill set and very knowledgeable on the menu.  The assistant manager Christian stopped by as did the owner Will also stopped at my table and we had a great conversation.\n\nTwo benefits of sitting solo - although that is not planned... I need to work on my people-attracting skills.  :-)  1. You get sooooo much food and don't have to share.  2.  The staff makes a point to talk to the \""lonely guy.\""  I just need the spotlight on me like in that Steve Martin movie.  Enough about me...\n\nThe Leinie's Vanlla Porter was amazing.  I'm a Porter fan but I had never come across this before.  And, the Gingerbread Spiced Ale was also very tasty.  I highly recommend both.\n\nThe menu sampling served was extensive - appetizers included kale chips, \""improper nachos\"", Southern Egg Roll, and Edamame.  The Egg Rolls were my favorite.  I would like to try the nachos (actually house made chips) without the pimento cheese but rather with some of the vinegar based sauce.  But, all of the apps were \""can't go wrong\"" choices... even the kale chips which I usually don't go for.  They also slid in a side - Grilled Piemento Cheese.  Another fav for the evening.  I wonder if they will serve this on gluten free bread when they open?\n\nThe salads served were the Amanda's Awesome Salad and the BBQ Salad.  Mixed results for me.  I am not a beet guy so Amanda's missed the mark for me.  But the BBQ Salad was excellent and... unusual flavor.\n\nThe entrees included pulled pork, pulled chicken and sliced brisket.  The brisket was moist and flavorful.  No sauce needed!  The chicken was excellent with the Spicy Hoison.  The pork was good with any sauce but I especially liked a mix of Frank's and Mama B's.\n\nThe sides are my belt had to make priorities.  So, I tried the mac and cheese (great), the two slaws (Asian Slaw and  House Slaw) I liked both but preferred the Asian as the House Slaw was a little over powered by the onions.\n\nLastly, the Peach Cobbler.  OMG!  I got one all to myself (see the lonely guy syndrome above).  I took down maybe 20% of it but the fine folks there let me take the rest home.  I will enjoy that again this weekend!\n\nGreat job to all!"
4642	1	a	Even though I suffered a devastating loss on the raffle, nothing could take down the good times that were had at this event.  The beers were actually pretty good and I enjoyed the vanilla porter.  With the help of alcohol I was able to meet some great new people.  RaRa is definitely a trip!  The food was wonderful and my eyes are now open to the world of bbqasian.  I really enjoyed the eggrolls and of course the giant plate of meat.  Also, I learned that I can eat vegetables if meat/bacon are in it.  Big shout out to Cutey Mcdimpletons on another wonderful job and I can't wait to go up on a Tuesday next month
4643	1	a	I popped my elite cherry at this event and enjoyed every minute! I was greeted by Nikki who kindly acknowledged that this was my first elite event and she even gifted me with a yelp elite bath towel which was a nice surprise. I brought a friend as my 'plus one' and we headed to the bar right after check in.\n\nWe both tried the beer on draft, I had the gingerbread ale (very tasty, nice subtle gingerbread flavor) and we were treated to the baked BBQ kale chips as an app while we waited for the full-on menu tasting to begin. As we waited, we got to meet Christian, the assistant manager of the Improper Pig. He gave us a personal explanation of the location's background. The Improper Pig is part of a larger restaurant family that includes the Pizza Peel locations, among others.\n\nThe term menu-tasting was not taken lightly at the Improper Pig. We got to sample multiple apps: the baked kale chips, the improper nachos, southern egg rolls, stuffed jalapenos, and edamame. As for entrees, we got to enjoy the BBQ salad option, the brisket, chicken, pulled pork and full array of their sides which included brussel sprouts, sweet potato hash, collard greens, mac & cheese, and two kinds of cole slaw. In addition to their six BBQ sauce offerings. Dessert was peach cobbler served in a iron skillet.\n\nMy personal favs? The 'nachos' (which had more of a consistency of a potato chip) with melted pimento cheese and green onions, the BBQ salad, sweet potato hash (I am STILL thinking about! creamy sweet potato goodness), and the pulled chicken and pork. I would've LOVED the egg rolls if they weren't covered in the spicy mustard sauce. The sauce literally set my face on fire to the point where both my eyes and nose started to run. H-O-T. A huge shot of wasabi directly to the taste buds. The sauce is something that should be served on the side.\n\nThe Improper Pig waitstaff was very kind and it was nice of them to take the time to explain every meal before serving. It was nice night of good energy and food capped off with a yummy hot cider bar!\n\nAlso - HUGE shout out to Jeff (the photographer of the event) for the music recs!!\n\nThanks again Nikki!
4644	0	a	I've heard a lot about this place and nachos are my life so we went in with really high expectations, so maybe that's why my dinner was so meh. \nI ordered the Daddy's Margarita and that was awesome!!!!\nAlso good? The bottomless chips and salsa. Everything was pretty blah from there.\n\nI got the Tostada nacho appetizer for dinner. The seasoning on the meat was like...they tried to do Mexican flavors but got confused or were missing the right spices and used something else. It was just weird. And I totally appreciate super loaded nachos... these were just too much. \n\nMy husband got the buffalo chicken nachos and got approximately 3 tiny pieces of buffalo chicken on them. \n\nThank god for the bottomless chips and salsa or we probably would've gone hungry. \n\nOur server was great and had an awesome sense of humor, so that helped. I'm glad we went and tried it out, but I don't think we'll be going back.
4645	0	a	We ate at this new restaurant yesterday - Saturday - about 2:00 pm.  \n\nSO MANY reasons why we will never go back there.\n\n1 - With a name like Nacho Daddy, I would expect that the place would offer a lot more with respect to Nachos - build your own, nacho bar, etc.  This restaurant had none of that - at least we didn't see it.  Our group did order one order of nachos - enchilada style - YUCK - so little melted cheese - you could barely see it.   Not great.  \nSent back to kitchen to add a few beans and it took almost 20 minutes - the table was done eating by the time the order came - note:  the restaurant had less than 50 people in it...\n\n2 - Being a new restaurant in this area, they should be better.  Surely there was a manager on duty - but not once did he/she ever walk around and check each table to see how the meal/experience was going...\n\n3 - The chips and salsa and guac ($10) was good - but we will not be back ever.\n\n4 - One person in our party ordered a bowl with beans/chicken - it was delivered on a black rectangular plate- HORRIBLE presentation - very unappetizing.  Although the chicken had good flavor.  For the $, it was not much food though.  How much do black beans/rick really cost you, Nacho Daddy?  Don't mind you making a profit, but you do need to reevaluate your menu pricing.  A little out of line - you have to compete with Chipotle and Cafe Rio just a block away - yes, they are fast casual and Nacho Daddy is not - but families that don't care about drinking a margarita or beer will not be interested in your restaurant more than once, based on your current menu.\n\n5 - 3 people ordered a meal/iced tea and 2 had only chips/guac/salsa/tea -- our bill was $70 (before tip without bar drinks).  For lunch, that is ridiculous.  \n\nWe will go down the street another block and go to Cafe Rio - it's fast casual, but quality food and fresh ingredients - and the entire meal for us would have been closer to $35...\n\nI'm placing my bet now - Nacho Daddy's will never make it at this location.
4646	0	a	Bland.  Chips and salsa is okay. Having shrimp fajitas and they have no taste. Shrimp could not only be cooked more have some flavor. Onions and peppers are soggy and on top of this the rice has no taste and the beans taste like paste. \n\nWell I tried worth the trip to the strip and El Segundo.
4647	0	a	Love the atmosphere, loved the staff, but the food was lacking. \n\nWe got there for Monday Night Football and grabbed a great seat by the bar. We immediately ordered the Mexican Corn and the Spicy Shrimp Nachos. The corn was okay. Definitely over cooked or had been cooked and sitting out a while. The nachos were horrid. For $17 you get maybe 4-5 medium shimp cut up into smaller pieces. The chips were SO greasy!!!! For $17 I was expecting more. The worst part is that I've been up since 3am with food poisoning from the under cooked shrimp. I should have known by looking at them. \n\nThe staff is the only reason I gave two stars. Attentive and genuine.  I so badly wished the food was better. I'll gladly go elsewhere, pay half that price and get 5 star nachos.
4648	1	a	I came here last night for happy hour and was pleasantly surprised... I am not a fan of Mexican food and had frequented the Firefly that was previously here so I was not quite sure to expect. \n\nThey have a decent happy hour menu - $5 dollar house margaritas (and they didn't skimp on booze). I was happy with the food on the happy hour menu as it wasn't all carbs. I had the ceviche and I have no complaints. The grilled corn tempted me too.\n\nI don't really have anything negative to say. Perhaps they could have free chips and salsa? (I was always a fan of the bread/weird butter at Firefly)\n\nI would go back.. and I know my friends definitely will (they live much closer).
4649	1	a	Came in for drinks and was welcomed from the minute we got in. Sat at the bar and was greeted by Ann the bartender(great smiling and upbeat personality). Saw the sign outside saying you have the best Margarita in town. Ann suggested the Primo Margarita and decided to give it a try. I absolutely loved it!!! Your employees are very attentive to the needs of your customers, I will be back in the future!!
4650	1	a	"I always jeered at the prospect of going to a restaurant that specialized in nachos.  I would hear stories of my friend who would praise Nacho Daddy on his side of town for hours on end.  I was so close to going the one Downtown, however I was recalled home prematurely by my significant other.\n\nThis time.  This time, it was DESTINY!   My friends and I counted the days to opening when we first saw it was coming to our side of town.  The the time came.  We sat, we ate, we got full.  We left happy.\n\nThis place was awesome.  Great ambiance.  Awesome Servers.  Insane menu!  The prices may be a tiny bit higher than what we usually spend, but totally worth it.\n\nI got the \""Fiesta Chicken Nachos\"" with my now infamous custom order of Diet Cherry Coke.  \n\nBoth were spot on.  The Nachos were very tastey.  When they came, I didn't know how to attack it.  I accidently got a  little bit of cheese on my finger and when sucked my finger clean, it hit me!  My first bite of Nacho Daddys.  It was epic.\n\nThe Fiesta Chicken Nachos was very creamy, very rich (but not too rich) and there was definitely enough for me to take it home if I was sensible that day.  But I wasn't.  I DESTROYED the plate and it was glorious!\n\nI swear up and down that it tasted like I was hitting pockets of CHOCOLATE in my nachos.  As crazy as that sounds and as gross as the prospect may be, it was good!\n\nOur server was astute and prompt.  For being open for only a few days when we visited, the place was well put together and on the ball.  \n\nI highly recommend this place.\n\n- Clean\n- Spacious\n- Music Videos playing, Sports playing, TVs everywhere."
4651	0	a	"seriously nasty and obnoxiously overpriced.  10 bucks for a draft beer in a warm mug.  not a good way to start.   I also tried 3 street tacos (pork, chicken and beef).  other than the pork taco being similar to a salt lick, they were pretty flavorless.  on a dare I also tried the Mexican corn on the cob.  I know it's nearly winter and realize that no self-respecting restaurant would ever serve \""fresh\"" corn on the cob this time of year, but I couldn't resist (if only to have something to write about on yelp).  it was truly gross. a single, lifeless ear of corn most likely cooked some time yesterday or the day before and heated up for service.  at 6 bucks I could only laugh.  it lived down and exceeded my lowest expectations. zero chance this place will make it.  if I want food this lame and this overpriced, i'll go down to the strip."
4652	0	a	I wanted to like this place, I really did. \n\nPros: \nPrompt service\nGood margaritas\nFriendly atmosphere\n\nCon's:\nNoisy kids\nSub par nachos\nPrice\n\nMy nachos were just okay. They were chicken nachos and it was a constant scavenger hunt trying to locate meat. They should've been called 'bean nachos with a chicken surprise'. My date ordered some beef nachos, and this is where the 2 stars come in, his were great! Very flavorful with just the right amount of spice. The margaritas we ordered were very strong and a little sweet which made them perfect. At $60 for 3 drinks and 2 sets of nachos, definitely not worth it. I actually felt like Roberto's food had more flavor and I hate them.
4653	0	a	Honestly- don't waste your time. Way overpriced & even the water tastes bad.  I had a veggie burger- the only thing good about it was the onion I had added on .\nSodas are $3.50. Really? My brother says the nachos are mediocre (Rubio's nachos are better). My mom was non plussed by the enchiladas! Keep on movin past this one!
4654	0	a	We just ordered nachos and a burrito for delivery (via postmates) and were very disappointed by the quality of the food. It was average at best and pretty forgettable. We won't likely return again.
4655	0	a	My coworkers wanted to eat at Nacho Daddy for annual our work Christmas dinner & after hearing so much hype about the downtown location - I decided to give it a try.  (I figured Summerlin location would be just as fun as downtown). I tried to make reservations for our larger party in advance twice, each time my phone number was taken and they said a manager would call me, which did not ever happen. I finally called again a few days before our planned outing and just made a regular reservation, no manager approval needed. I realized it's probably a lot more casual than I was picturing.\n\nAfter we got there the servers and hostess were super nice and accommodating however the food itself was not great (I'd rather eat nachos from Robertos or KoMex) and I am not sure if it is because of where we were sitting or the fact there were other large parties there, but half my party ordered extras (like sour cream or guacamole) and it didn't come until the end of the meal, after they had eaten most or all of their food.\n\nThe name Nacho Daddy is cute and the thought behind the food and menu was better than the food itself.  The prices were reasonable (my bill was half of what I had budgeted on spending on our party) but I do not plan on returning there again.  After hearing feedback from my staff in the office the next week their sentiments were the same.
4656	0	a	Tried this place for something different.  Like some other reviews, don't waste tour money.  Very overpriced for what you get.  The service was good..the food, not bad but there are other great options for less.  Most likely great for some drinks and overpriced appetizers.
4657	0	a	Videos playing were the best part. Service was pretty good. Food way,way overpriced for mediocre taste at best. Wife was surprised I brought him here after trying it once before. Gave it two shots, won't be back.
4658	0	a	This was the worst pizza and worst service I have ever had. DO NOT spend your money here. It is awful!!!!
4659	0	a	I found this place through groupon.  I will probably never return.  the store is pretty, but the actual service has been sub par.    \n\nI got an eye exam & 2 pairs of glasses.  from the time of my exam to the time I got both pairs of glasses was 3 weeks 5 trips total with 2 cancellations on their part.  I have politely requested an itemized receipt 4 times in person & have called in 4 times after receiving my frames just for this receipt.  I have not received my receipt or any follow up phone calls.  \n\ni've been wearing glasses for over 20 years & it has never taken so long to receive my frames.  while I am satisfied with my actual frames & lenses.  I think my overall experience has been unsatisfactory.  next time I will go to lenscrafters where the service is faster & I know I will get an itemized receipt.
4660	0	a	Although the restaurant was very clean with decent service, it was very pricey for some mediocre food and bland hot chocolate.\nWe and a couple of friends ordered the three fruit crepes with warm compote, chicken fettuccine, and chicken fried steak. \n\nCrepes- Weren't too satisfied with the artificial flavored syrup and coloring.\n\nChicken Fettuccine- Chicken was lacking seasoning, not very tasteful.\n\nWe don't believe we would return back here in the near future.
4661	1	a	Food is delicious! Portions are big. Everything about this place is amazing. It really looks and taste like everything is freshly made.
4662	1	a	Ate here a few hours ago as I wanted to try this location for the first time since I'm used to the Charleston and Decatur location which I frequent when I can. Anyhow my first impression is this location is alot bigger then the other location and I love the design they also have alot more to add on the menu compared to the other location as for the food it was just as good as the other location same big portions for the same exact price the only negative was the potatoes some were cooked the others were real raw to the point where I couldn't eat anymore but that's my only grip with the food as it was delicious I'm still full and this was about 10:30 am and now it's 1:24 pm lol. As for the service it was so so the lady didn't check on me as much as she did and she didn't offer me a knife fork or spoon she was nice but I just wish she checked on me more then she did other then that with those major gripes I think I might come back here again.
4663	1	a	Turkey dinner is pretty good.  But the gravy was a bit too salty.  Next time will order it on the side.  \n\nThe Alaskan Waffle with Strawberries are my favor.  Warm waffle, vanilla ice cream and strawberries and whip cream.  So ooooo. Good!
4664	0	a	The food was alright, eggs not cooked all the way but biscuits and gravy was great., however the service was terrible with late food and drinks halfway through the meal, wrong drinks. I would never come to this place again thanks to the service.
4665	0	a	Don't waste your time or money, a better meal can be found at burger king next door. My sister sent back the turkey dinner because it smelled disgusting and unhealthy. The chicken salad was completely flavorless but maybe I could have tasted it if they put more than one tablespoon of chicken salad on the bread. Although the little bit of it that I had tasted like clean water. The chili, total garbage...it advertised meat and beans in the coli but I have yet to find meat.\nNeedless to say, I recommend eating someplace else
4666	1	a	I really enjoyed my experience at this location that is closer to my condo. We visited on Christmas night and we each ordered the Holiday special. \n\nI ordered the classic turkey dinner which was $12.99 for a complete turkey dinner which included, soup or salad, drink and any dessert! The sage stuffing was delicious and the gravy was so tasty! They really packed on the turkey which was tender along with stuffing, mashed taters and corn.\n\nMy guest ordered the cherry glazed Ham dinner which included, soup or salad, drink and any dessert for $12.99.\n\nThis was a lot of food and both of our meals were delicious! This was a Holiday special keep in mind however I would make a visit even if not a holiday to have a turkey dinner which is always on their menu!\n\nI really enjoyed this new location as it was clean, bright and comfortable.\n\nThe dessert counter looks Amazing as you walk in the front door. The hardest part was deciding on what dessert to order at the end which we asked them to pack up to go.\n\nWe will be back for sure to enjoy a nice restaurant meal and experience!
4667	0	a	Probably the worst corned beef hash skillet I've ever had. Sounded great but when it came out it was all potatoes and seriously about a two bites of corned beef. Server asked if everything was ok, I asked if that's normally the amount of corned beef, she says yeah and walks away knowing I'm obviously not happy.  Over all not a good experience.
4668	1	a	"My husband & I just bought a small condo for when we visited our family and we needed a mattress. After looking at a few other \""pushy\"" mattress stores, we randomly walked into this store. There are two Mattress Firm stores a few hundred feet apart (not related). We were warmly greeted by Ty (store mgr). He was direct, honest, and knowledgeable. We are now getting our new mattress delivered free ,with other incentives , tomorrow. Couldn't be more pleased!"
4669	1	a	Love the food. I rank this as one of the top authentic Pak Afgan restaurants in the U.S. To me Nehari is the litmus test and this place has passed that test almost every single time. I have taken my family, friends, colleagues and everybody has enjoyed the food.
4670	1	a	Just discovered Grape this past weekend. Had a fantastic meal and the scallops were amazing. Wine and service were equally amazing. Really enjoyed the Jazz band and will be back to Grape very soon.
4671	1	a	This is a great place if you have a burger craving! They have so many toppings to choose from! I had the semi serious burger with cheddar cheese and guacamole, it was awesome! We ordered an order of fries for the table which were very tasty! My daughter got a banana shake that was really good. Lots of Shake flavors too. They also have salads and wraps. The whole staff is super nice and we had great service! I am so happy that there is a location on my side of town! I will be back! This is my favorite burger place!
4672	1	a	I'm so happy you came into my life Cheeburger Cheeburger. I love me a good cheeburger, what do I love more than a cheeburger? A mik shak. Seriously, their shake list is a whose who in the milk shake world. Dozens of flavors and concoctions, so many to try, such little time! On my first trip to C-squared I went with the classic chocolate shake and was disappointed I only ordered a 1/2 size one. It was awesome, made with actual chocolate ice-cream. That's a rarity. I used to think Denny's had the best shakes, now I think this joint does. Well done!\n\nAs far as the cheeburger goes - good grief do you have options. 25 free toppings which includes things like jalapenos, onion rings, standard burger veggies, guacamole - oh ya, and they're all FREE. Free is for me. That's the motto I live by at least. I took advantage of a good 10 or so toppings, ordered a 1/3lb burger, and proceeded to house that SOB. Split an order of Fries/Onion Ring combo with my lovely lady, and called it a day.\n\nThis new location is located way too close to home. Writing this review makes me want to head back there for another burger, some onion rings, and about 7 chocolate shakes. What can I say? I love shakin' it up.
4673	0	a	Was looking forward to a new place I  heard that serves good burgers.  At the very beginning I knew I was not going to be happy with the service.  The server had to repeatedly asked how we ordered each of our burgers and fries.  \nNow  about the food one of the burgers only covered half of the bun on top of that was cold. They also had no flavor what so ever.  Took two bites and was done it was so small. The other burger that was the same size as my burger as ordered was twice as big and also cold.  My other friend ordered the pounder which is no bigger than any other large burgers in town and was very dry not cooked to order.\nAll three of us also ordered french fries the fries came out cold and needed seasoning but in all the best thing they had.  I ordered the onion rings they were some of the best in town.\nWe sat for nearly 15 minutes waiting to get our bill for our meal. Should have had it when we were done when the server cleared the table.\nOverall not happy with the place for what one gets all round.
4674	0	a	Ok so we decided to try out Cheeburger Cheeburger, and if you love kids then this place is for you.  Not only is the service slow they also messed up our order. The manager of the place is timid and does not approach problem tables and only go to ones with no problems. Just sitting here and watching numerous issues among other tables and how long food took to get served. Not sure we will be back.
4675	0	a	They have a lot to learn.  We opted to try this new burger place but will never know how the food is. Talk about slow that is an understatement.  It was so slow we never did receive our food.  After waiting an hour after our order was taken we walked out.  Now I heard excuses before but to say your food takes longer because it is so fresh holy cow!  Because you must have been slaughtering the cow onsite and grinding the meat.  Next time check on your customers more often, then offer the truth when you realize you screwed up.  Don't send a manager after the customer asked about their food 20 minutes ago and tables around them that received their orders before yours when yours was placed a good 15 minutes before.  Amazing Smashburger down the street had our fresh cooked burgers to us in 8 minutes.  A lot to learn.
4676	0	a	I ate at the original location on Sanibel Island in the late 80s. I can't remember what I thought of the place back then.\n\nFast forward to 2014...\n\nOrdered two burgers cooked medium. They came out well done and had zero taste. I loved the toppings but for a better burger at a better price, I'll stick with Five Guys. It blows this place away.
4677	0	a	First one I've seen since living in Colorado so I was excited. Disappointment followed quickly.\n\n\nRestaurant was empty besides the register employee friends so obviously I sat there for 20 minutes without anyone saying anything.\n\nOnce he came over he asked asinine questions. I think he may be a little slow.\n\nPrices matched my spectacular service. \n\n\nOrdered:\nPatty melt-$8.99\nLarge fry- 4.99\nAnd an original shake-5.69\n\nTotal: $21.26\n\nThis place sucks. Stay away.
4678	0	a	Wow.. I can't believe there's more than one of these bad boys. Two stars is very generous. \n\nI don't often write reviews immediately after dining, but these gem deserves special attention. I went the original location years ago, and have no memory of what I had or how it was (clue #1). I've explored just about every restaurant near my job, and I was excited to try something new. I was expecting a fast food joint, but to my surprise I walked into a colorful 50s style diner. \n\nEverything on the menu is a la carte, so I settled on a patty melt and medium fries. It took about 15 minutes to get our food which is decent for 12pm, however, I was completely underwhelmed. The patty melt was nearly tasteless and the fries were similar to Five Guys with less seasoning. It wasn't terrible, but for $8.99 (cost of the patty melt) I can get a complete meal up the street that I'd actually enjoy. \n\nSkip this joint. Instead try Freddy's, Smashburger, Wendy's.. even McDonald's. Yup, it's that bad.
4679	0	a	1 star for food , 2nd star for our waitress . This place is ok . Came here for a dinner with the family we are from L.A and I have always heared this place is awesome well no its not . Our order was all wrong and our burgers were undercooked. Took over an hour for our food and the fries and onion rings were discusting with grease dripping off . \n\nLoud and noisy \nCrammed seating \nFreezing inside \nThe hostess was pulling up her pants the whole time when she was walking around seating people her pants were falling and she was pulling them up by the belt buckle holes and her pants were ripping on the thigh from pulling so hard !
4680	1	a	I was on a mission to try this new restaurant. After having spoken with a fellow foodie I had learnt that El Cartel make everything fresh by hand. Which meant they make fresh tortillas by hand !! This is a big deal. They also don't use the usual, masa harina but blue corn which is much more flavoursome. I was sold. It's been practically impossible to find this level of freshness with Mexican food in Edinburgh, I had to try it ASAP!\n\nWe trucked along, to the old tex mex 2 location and were sat in a lovely booth. I was very impressed with the music selection, it's not everyday (or ever) that you hear souls of mischief in public these days.\n\n  The menu is very minimal but everything is cooked fresh, prepared to order. We ordered the guacamole & plantains, which were light and crispy. The guacamole had a little spice but nothing my toddler couldn't stand and was topped with fresh and sweet pomegranate seeds. Very lovely with the avocado pieces, and chunks of Mexican cheese (maybe cotija? A crumbly and light not very overpowering cheese) everything very fresh and tasty. And spot on taste wise.\n\nThe tacos were very good, each pair comprising of many different toppings. The steak had salsa verde some kind of cabbage and spring onions . The tortillas were very tasty, they had this nice earthy corn taste that you  don't get from the store bought ones. Very authentic indeed. \n\nThe carnitas pibil was spicier but also very tasty. The pork is roasted with ancho chilies  and quite literally smothered in a red onion escabeche but seemed more pickeled to me. Either way very flavourful and delightful.  We all enjoyed every bite.\n\nReally impressed and hope that this place does really well as the food is excellent and it is quite nice to eat homemade tortillas!
4681	1	a	when i saw that the doors of Tex Mex II were closed for good, i'll admit i was a bit heartbroken.  it had been one of my favourite mexican restaurants in edinburgh and to see that it was gone left me both nacho-less and with a small burrito sized hole in my heart.  but then, as the restaurant world turns, El Cartel opened its doors full of mexican goodness.\n\nEl Cartel is conveniently owned by the Bon Vivant (which appears to be building a small edinburgh empire) that is basically across the street.  but instead of the cocktails and bistro food this is very much tequila and tacos.  i went for lunch time between christmas and new year and at 1pm found the place completely empty.  i was a bit surprised as there is always a bit of hype around a new restaurant but this suited me fine as it meant i had my pick of tables.  the layout remains very similar to Tex Mex but has a more rustic feel with some exposed brick walls and dark wood furniture match with purple hues.  it's cosy enough although was bloody freezing when i went for lunch!\n\nwhen my friend arrived we decided to order a few tacos to spilt between us and the guacamole.  as some have mentioned previously the guacamole with plantain chips is the true standout dish.  it was simple and delicious and i wish they had it in a to go option to take home.  between us we had the fish tacos, duck tacos, and plantain tacos.  they were all good, i particularly enjoyed the plantain ones but found the portions to be tiny.  this was good for lunch as you probably don't want a massive portion but may leave you hungry after dinner.\n\nwe didn't try any drinks (it was lunchtime afterall) but they have a few varieties of margaritas on offer that would be good to try another time.  i do plan to go back, but not in a rush.  i thought the price was a bit high for what was on offer and while the quality was good there was just something lacking.  i know a new restaurant takes time to bed in so i'll make a point to visit again in another few months for the guacamole if nothing else.
4682	1	a	"It is the \""Chipotle\"" of Greek food!  Portions are very generous.  You can choose your protein, veggies and sauces.  They have a yogurt-based tzatziki and a sour-cream based.  We had one of each between us, and really liked both.  I had the bowl which was an awesome salad.  It comes with pita triangles which was just right for lunch.  Very kid friendly in here, but no kids menu that I noticed."
4683	1	a	We saw The Simple Greek on the tv show, The Profit, (Love Marcus) and decided to drive the 30 minutes and take the family.....we were so glad that we did.  When we arrived the restaurant was super busy and we thought it would take forever, not a chance...We were able to place our order quickly and being a newbie, the workers were very pleasant and helpful.  My 6 year old (picky eater) even loved it.  Bottom line...the food was awesome, place was super clean, the employees helpful, and the baklava was da bomb diggity.  It just melts right in your mouth!  We can't wait to go back!  P.S. Would love to hear the Greek Music!
4684	1	a	Neat little thing to check out if you are downtown. Its on fremont and 8th, just a block away from container park so it's super convenient. Free admissions, lots of lights! They just charge for photos, ice skating, sledding, and food trucks. If you're looking for a fun, free christmas adventure, this is the place to go! It's filled with Christmas trees, lights, and a giant tree right in the center. They also have free shows in the lounge area. Plenty of seating but it might get packed closer to the holiday.
4685	0	a	K its a Thursday night at 7:00 pm and this place was a ghost town.... Very sad by this told my 4 year old about this got in the car and pull up and YEP IT CLOSED. WHy promote this and downtown wants local business but if you cant have the places open how will that happen....\nSee my review on the BBQ place at the container park Big Ern's BBQ. It just was a crapping evening in DOWNTOWN tonight
4686	1	a	A bit late for a christmas attraction but we like the quiet, a few days after the holiday with the kids and some friends and we have the whole park to ourselves. Besides the fact that is not the best area to walk alone, its a nice production. Where else my girl will enjoy snow in vegas anyway?!
4687	1	a	So impressed with this new location! It's much roomier than the other locations, you have room to paint, look, and shop without feeling cramped. The staff is very helpful- I ended dropping my piece and rubbed off/smeared the majority of the BLACK puffy paint. Grayson helped me scrape it off and it ended up looking like it did before the mess up. I would highly recommend the classes, very informative, fun, and a great deal. If you're looking for something fun to do I would definitely check it out!
4688	1	a	Had a yummy toasted Chicken Torta sandwich for lunch today.  Staff was super friendly and the owners stopped by my table to chat and make sure everything tasted great.  Looks like they have a nice bottled beer and wine selection as well as a small bar with some beers on tap.  Definitely check them out!
4689	1	a	So nice I ate there twice. In a row. And I'm already having withdrawals.\n\nThis place serves up sandwiches large enough for, well, a rhino. No need for a side item. They source their bread from Local Loaf, which in my opinion, make the sandwiches. Grab the Chicken Torta for your first try. It's incredible!\n\nService is well paced and friendly. I can see this place easily sliding into a Charlotte staple. So glad someone is stepping up to the plate and filling the affordable, local lunch spots we desperately need. Thanks!
4690	1	a	Rhino Market is situated in Wesley Heights right behind Burger Co.  It is a great addition to this area, and if I still lived across the street they would have to name it Michael's Market.  This would be due to me drawing against my 401k to pay my tab every night.  It is comparable to Common Market without all the quirky toys/gifts you can buy.  Their sandwiches are top notch especially the sicilian. Add in great beers on tap and  a more diverse beer to go section and there you have it, Rhino Market.
4691	1	a	This place has great quality stuff. I think it might be better than Allegro Hearth Bakery, and the products are a lot more appropriate for everyday than Gaby et Jules's fancy desserts and macarons. So, I'll be back.\n\nI've been there twice, and I had a mushroom quiche ($3.50), an onion, chevre, and pear focaccia tart ($4.50), and a smallish baguette ($2.00).\n\nMy only complaint: they don't post the prices! Their online menu shows only the special-order items, not the everyday one-offs that you can find in the shop. So, if you want to know how much you're spending, you have to ask the cashier about each item individually. I guess I don't mind doing that but many people find it pretty awkward.
4692	1	a	I know this spot is cursed, due to many restaurants closing at this spot. However, this place seems like the new touch of tuscon desert needs and fills a valid role in Chandler fashion square. To be honest I was not willing to go at first and got dragged here by my significant other. The explain the service I doubt I could do it justice. They were willing to let us sample all their flavors from cheese to several of the beets before deciding. They were very attentive and caring for a chain restaurant. I understand this is the fifth in the chain. The food was great. Actually the portions were larger than expected and the flavor was not skipped. I have tried at least three of the tacos. Not to mention diet friendly for my vegan and gluten free friends. Just wow. I don't normally dish out a four star rating a first time but this place really has it. Even the rice is good. Something most places overlook. It's blooming with cilantro and flavor.
4693	0	a	My friends wanted to try this place for the first time on his birthday and it ended up being a horrible experience. After two drinks they cut everyone off! So we decided to leave of course and the staff over heard where we were going and called that bar to tell them not to serve us! Unbelievable! We did nothing wrong, were very calm and polite and I can tell you, no one was near drunk off of two drinks! We will never go there again.
4694	1	a	Cool place to hang out at the mall. We will definitely be back to watch games and hang at the bar. The garage theme is cool, and it'll be great to hang out on the patio in the spring.  The shrimp tacos and carne asada tacos were excellent. portions are big, not those little sample size tacos. Try it out if you are at the mall or looking for a good place to day drink or go for happy hour!
4695	1	a	"This restaurant is the best \""garage\"" ever!  \nMost of the staff is incredibly friendly and welcome you as you walk past. \n\nDecor is all moto... Shop rags for napkins, wheels for the base to booths, drop-light lighting, wrench chandelier, truck and motorcycle parts on the walls & ceilings, side mirror collage over sink basin, and the list goes on.  So very creative.    \nBig screen TVs everywhere for the sports fans.   \nThe food is a mixed lot.  \nFirst visit we ordered nachos... Thankfully only one order as they serve a HUGE amount.  (Seriously 1/4 sheet cake piled high). We chose the pork with prickly pear salsa and the meat was melt in your mouth perfection.   \n\nSecond visit I had the best hamburger that I've eaten in years.   No bun, but they do offer Gluten Free buns. Woohoo! Drag strip chicken was pretty good, dredged in corn flour, no wheat!!  Hubby had chimi, again like the nachos, the portion is HUGE.  ( good for a big dude )\n\nThe fries were undercooked and a little cold, but have potential.   \n\nThey were out of their \""special\"" (cannot remember what it was that day).  Good thing they have plenty to choose from.   And GLUTEN FREE options.  Which is good for those of is with intolerance or mild allergies.   I hope they are successful and stay!!!"
4696	0	a	Food is okay. Was sandbagged with a $27 bill for a steak and fries bowl, and sandwich. Careful when ordering!!!!
4697	1	a	I recently went to Vegas on 2 separate occasions, and Justin at NLS really made things come together perfectly. I've gone to many of the clubs in Vegas through many different hosts throughout the years, but how Justin takes care of you makes things just so easy and worry-free. I think I'll just call Justin every time I plan a trip to Vegas now.\n\nFirst met Justin when I came in the summer 2014 for my now brother-in-law's bachelor party, and was rolling with 25+ guys. First night got the biggest poolside table with a perfect view of Deadmau5. The next night, Zedd was spinning but we didn't want to get a table that night. Didn't have presale tix, sold out. I called Justin, and he walked all of us, the whole horde of guys straight in, NO LINE, and no extra charge other than the cover. Had other guys trickle in throughout the night and Justin walked them in as they came. Importantly, if you just waited in line to pay to get in, you would be restricted to OUTSIDE ONLY, but with Justin walking us in we had FULL ACCESS, no problem. Pretty much the perfect bachelor party weekend and all the guys thought I had some serious hookups at the clubs. \n\nThis past weekend, 6 of us went to Hakkasan and XS, no line, no problem, no funny business. Tons of people just waiting outside, and we just walk right in. He was really trying hard to get us a comped table at Hakkasan on Friday night, and he almost did, but we just got there too late (needed to be there at 10 but by the time we got there from LA it was past 11). \n\nJustin seems like he will always hook it up if he can and is always fast to reply, friendly, and seems really honest.  If you just want someone to take care of things for you, skip lines into clubs or getting a table without adding big fees, basically at cost and hassle-free, Justin is your guy. Just make sure you take care of him when he takes care of you...
4698	1	a	I recently turned to NLS to help plan a night out at life nightclub with friends. They definitely took care of us and the night was a blast.  I will definitely use them again.
4699	1	a	I absolutely love this place!!! The music selection is great it has not only a lot of oldies but goodies but also a bunch of new stuff!!! The staff is great,  the chef is awesome, and the prices are even better! Best spring rolls of my life are at this place!!! This is ny go to kareoke spot.
4700	0	a	Bring back the old wings! Used to love this place but now they serve wings that are larger than life, might as well serve the whole chicken. No more deri-q. Sad face...\n\nOnly upside is that their corn cheese and kimchi fried rice are still tasty.
4701	1	a	Looking for new seafood restaurant to try, and this one came up on yelp.\n\nIt is located inside the TPC club house.  The view from the restaurant is beautiful, especially now, a little over month away from the PGA tournament, the green was at the perfect condition.\n\nService was great. We had our server, but there were two other servers helped us with bringing food and refilling drinks.\n\nI had artichoke Atlantic salmon lunch. Salmon was very thick and juicy.  Sauce they poured on top complimented the salmon and mushrooms.\nThey used really good quality salmon and I enjoyed every bite of it.\n\nThey offered three different desert the day I went. I decided to try their vanilla pudding.  It was overly sweet, and fresh fruit mixed well with the pudding.\n\nEspresso was really good as well. It complemented the desert and was nice way to end a great lunch.\n\nSince the view was very nice, I would like to come back for early dinner during sunset.
4702	0	a	Meh.... Had the oysters to start and they were gritty and not shucked properly... Moved on to the lamb kabobs and were not at all expected..... Thought would be chucks of lamb instead was a slab lamb pop wrapped on a stick ... Tasted ok but expected different and expected better.... However.... The fried rice was Awsome!
4703	1	a	This place is top notch. The sushi was excellent as was the service. Great upscale atmosphere and bar. This place isn't just for golfers. It's worth a night out.
4704	1	a	"A\nlove\ntrain\n\nURRKN stands for Underground Railroad Rescue Kitty Network and was started by Tina LaBlanc in Oct of 2011.  It's a way of transporting kitties from shelters, foster homes and temporary homes to their \""forever homes\"".\n\nIt's basically a series of wonderful volunteers that are willing to transport cats from one place to another.  One long trips each volunteer will drive whatever distance they feel comfortable and then meet another volunteer at a prearranged location.\n\nOn a long trip it might be many volunteers that selflessly give their time and transportation to help the kitty get to it's finally destination.  A person waiting for the kitty can actually keep track on the progress as the cat travels on it's \""love train\"".\n\nWe recently adopted a kitty from Florida that had to be transported to Rhode Island.  We contacted URRKN and volunteers were quickly arranged so our kitty, Gersemi, arrived to us quickly and in great health and spirits.\n\nThere is no charge for this incredible service but of course donations are accepted.  It all depends on the kindness and generosity of strangers who anonymously do good without asking for anything but a simple thank you.\n\nThe volunteers of the URRKN along with Tina LaBlanc, are doing great deeds in a quiet way.  Such acts of kindness for no other reason but to be kind are wonderful and rare things that should never be taken for granted.\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/groups/URRKN/"
4705	0	a	I was a volunteer driver for two years for URRKN.  They are a nonprofit 501c (3) organization run by Tina LaBlanc and her husband.  I was very excited to be a member with all these cat lovers taking cats to their forever homes.  Unfortunately, there is a dark side to URRKN.  Tina LaBlanc was asking members to donate to various causes that covered personal, not URRKN related, expenses for Tina and other Administrators only.  From trips, vacations, car repairs and clothing to house upgrades.  All members, including management, are volunteers and provide their time free of reimbursement.  URRKN is not a rescue, foster, or other pet related organization.  It is a transportation group only.  Moving cats from point A to point B, all free of charge.  Any expenses for the cat is absorbed by the adopter and adoptee.\nIt was also brought to my attention that transports were based on how big a donation you made to URRKN, not the first come first serve basis we all thought.  Some transports were taking up to 5 months to organize.  Others in two weeks.\nJust recently, a You Caring request for $3000 in funds was posted on the members page requesting donations to fix a administrators car.  At this time, no administrator is taking a salary or being reimbursed for expenses.  I questioned these donations and was banned from commenting.  I since realized that URRKN was violating 501c(3) nonprofit operation rules and found another group to drive for who is totally transparent.\nBefore you join or donate, please research this organization.  Do not be taken advantage of like I was.
4706	0	a	Unfortunately, this group does not always get their kitties to their new adoptees.  One cat was lost while in the care of an URRKN overnight hostess's home.  As of this date, she has not been found and its been a year.  The adopter is still devastated.  Another adopter received a kitten with a deadly virus that not only killed the kitten, but, also infected two of her family cats, one who perished along with the kitten.\nMismanaged donations and unfair scheduling of transports are just a couple of concerns for this group.  It appears the more money you donate the more VIP treatment you get.  Some transports take 5 months to organize where the norm is 2 to 3 weeks.  If you want your kitty you need to shell out the money.\nURRKN has been known to transport kitties across state lines with no Health Certificates.  Hence, sick kittens are being transported when they should be under vet care.  Donations cannot be accounted for and are being requested by management from the members to support management personal causes as in eye surgery, home improvements, car repairs, etc.\nBefore you donate or become a member, please research this organization and its reputation.
4707	0	a	"It's great to have a nice place in the neighborhood. \n\nThe decor is very professionally done and it looks like a fabulous place for a date or nice night out.\n\nI met some clients at the bar where we had drinks. I found the service at the bar professional, but somewhat ambivalent in attitude. I don't want to be fawned over, but I do expect staff at a place like this to be a little more engaged and present. The selection of tap beers was short, but nice.\n\nAfterward, that same night, I met another client there for dinner. The service was good and the menu looked great. My guests all enjoyed their food. One had a large dinner salad, another had the buckwheat crepes, a third had the grass-fed steak and I had the Cornish hen, which the wait person had recommended because it was a family recipe. The presentation and appearance of all of our dinners was excellent. The flavors in my Cornish hen and the sides were delicious. What I am in shock over is the portion and the price. The menu states \""Cornish hen\"", it is $23 and there is no mention of the portion. It was not a full Cornish hen. It was not a half Cornish hen. It was a 1/4 Cornish hen. One very small leg connected to one very small thigh. That's it. I've seen more meat in an average size chicken strip.\n\nI will try Oliver's again, but will be more careful when I order."
4708	0	a	"I was really excited for Oliver's to open but was pretty disappointed when I ate there on their opening night. I had read that Oliver's price point was supposed to fall between nearby Lombardino's ($$$) and Blue Moon ($$), and was pretty shocked when I saw that most main courses were actually in the $18-$30 range. I ordered one of the less expensive dishes, the macaroni, and found it to be a little burnt. When I ordered the macaroni, the waitress asked me \""would you like a soup or salad with that?\"" so I requested the soup, assuming that it was included in my dish - I was then shocked to find that an $8 charge for soup was included in my bill. I thought that this was pretty misleading. \n\nOn the pro side, the soup, bread appetizer, and cocktails were really good. But again, they were a little too expensive (minus the bread, which was complimentary). I really really hope that Oliver's lowers their prices or adds some cheaper dishes (e.g. burgers and sandwiches). The neighborhood is mostly medical students and residents, and in my opinion, a menu and price point similar to The Old Fashioned would fare much, much better."
4709	0	a	"I should've known my visit wasn't  going to fare well when our waitress mentioned \""We've been open for a week and working out all the kinks\"". Unfortunately, the kinks were not worked out by the time of our visit.\nThe interior is warm and inviting and caught our eye when we walked by. There is a bar as you walk in with some seating and the a larger dining room in the back. When I saw \""public house\"" as part of the restaurant's name, I was expecting a menu more focus on casual fare with a few sandwich options. Not the case here. With entrees in the high teens-low 20's and appetizers hovering around $10, the bill can get pretty high pretty quick. \nWhile the craft cocktails were worthy of their price point, the food was definitely not. I was impressed when the waitress steered my daughter away from the $15 adult mac and cheese and towards the version on the kids menu (she thought the adult maybe had too strong of flavors). I was not impressed to find out the bland kids version (served with ice cream) was $14. This is an absolute joke. My girlfriend went went the clans and mussels while I opted for the whitefish sticks appetizer and squash soup. The mussel/clam combo had a nice broth and served with grilled bread for dipping. But, for perhaps 7 mussels and another 6 clams, $16 is priced too high. My whitefish appetizer (with homemade chips) was fine but again overpriced ($10). On the other hand, my squash soup missed the mark severely. It took on the taste of the kale and was finished inexplicably with balsamic vinegar-completely masking the flavor of the creamy squash. \nParking is hard to come by (there is a space for patrons about a half block away) and with price points this high (and not having the food to match), I would be surprised if it lasts even a year. A shame as its a beautiful space."
4710	1	a	I wish I found this amazing delicious healhy place sooner! Im 35 weeks pregnant and just found my new favorite sweet fix...and its super healthy! Dragonfruit, Acai Bowl...granola, peaches, pineapple, papaya, banana, coconut & honey....no more ice cream for me! Its so easy to eat healthy and cure cravings at Juice N Go!! Thanks foe the suggestion Alex.
4711	1	a	I would give it all 5 stars but i don't want it to go to their heads.  They just opened and I have only been here this one time.  Anyway I am so happy a more than decent sushi bar is in the neighborhood.  I am sure i will be adding the 5th star soon. By the way the service was awesome Mike and John are tops.
4712	1	a	Excellent sushi. The service was outstanding. Quality and freshness superb! Will be going back very soon to this neighborhood gem!
4713	1	a	What a great local shop! Loved Meeting the owners and taking a look behind the scenes at how they make some of the yummy confections. The coffee was really smooth and tasty as well. Thanks Nikki for hosting such a fun get together!
4714	1	a	The Filmont Company built me a dining room table made from a reclaimed bowling alley. I absolutely love it!  Even after having it in my house for a few months I still get excited when I walk in my kitchen and see it. The craftsmanship is outstanding. I love the design of the picnic table style legs that were made from steel, then welded to the frame and polished. It is so well built and so unique that I know it will be a piece that is passed down for generations. I get compliments on it every time some one sees it. Not only is the table incredible but the guys were great to work with, all of them were so nice! Thank you so much Filmont Co!
4715	0	a	AHHH I checked yelp for this immediately after walking in. Biggest joke by far. I wanted to take pictures to show how absurd the display and over all appearance of this place was, but didn't want to spend any extra time in there, trying to get a refund. It was sparse, everything was a duplicated version, apparently chairs from other presidents and other First Ladies dresses were in there. Nothing what I thought it would be. I would give a higher review for the supervisor that refunded me the 3 tickets I bought for locals, totaling $71. I would have been disappointed even if it was free. Oh well. Dallas here I come for the real deal.
4716	0	a	"Terrible.\n$25 a person (plus a $4) fee on top of each ticket. \nWhen we got to the ticket \""booth,\"" (it was actually a dining table with a table cloth draped over it), the ticket machine wouldn't work. Two people were ahead of us and we still were waiting 20 minutes to buy tickets. Finally (a plus here) a nice couple gave us their extra tickets for free: Thank-you (and boy am I glad I didn't have to pay).\n\nOther than the cars, and about 5 wee things, nothing is either real or even related to JFK. \n\nIt was set up like a primary school science project in a giant, vacant room. The posters with \""facts\"" were full of misspellings and even had some questionable accuracy.\n\nI spent time in there hoping that I'd stumble upon some gem, but alas it was awful.\n\nThe icing on the cake was when I fellow decided to cross the rope line to sit at one of JFK cars. HE SHOULD NOT HAVE DONE THIS, AND I DO NOT  CONDONE IT. HOWEVER, the man working at the \""gift area,\"" who I assume is also the curator and security guard?? Began yelling an screaming at this person. He then continued on to call the man \""stupid\"" and uttered swear words to himself. Then he did nothing. He allowed this \""offender\"" to continue on looking unsupervised. Then I witnessed him talking to another female that appeared to be working the exhibit as well. He spoke loudly using the F-word so that everybody at the exhibit could hear. Finally he expressed that he was less concerned about the car and more about getting the picture back from the \""offender.\"" What the Hell?\n\nI left shortly after that. I feel like the Tropicana did not do their research on this particular exhibit. I feel that the whole thing was purely for profit and that no legitimate interest or research on JFK was presented.\n\nVERY DISSAPOINTED. Glad I didn't pay. To the couple that handed us the free tickets Thank-you in more ways than one!"
4717	0	a	This place says it closes at 11pm and its 1020.... And they denied us service! :( \n\nWas actually really excited for this, sadly place is still run by unprofessional people.
4718	1	a	Clean atmosphere.... Ronin Burger....Dee-Freakin-licious !!!  Highly recommended !  Definitely coming back to try other specialty burgers.
4719	0	a	Grand Re(soft)Opening\n\nHappy Thanksgiving to Monkey Part I. \n\nSame clean and modern interior, 3 TVs, bar and kitchen visible behind large windows. Greeted & seated right away. HLK may be gone, but half it's menu items including smoothies still exist. The breakfast menu featuring their Hash and those delectable Pancakes will be making a return soon. \n\nMonkey do:\n\nSAPPORO DRAFT\nBLACK & GREEN BURGER - mushroom, spinach over Wagyu beef\nPORTUGESE DOUGHNUTS - very dense, fried balls of dough covered in sugar, served with jam.  mmmm donuts...  \n\nMonkey ordered burger medium, it arrived very rare in the middle.  Though, savory and delicious, i killed it without giving it a second thought.  Why would i?  It's Bachi Burger!  My ultimate favorite burger in Vegas...  \n\nI no longer posses a cast iron stomach to devour anything in my path...  therefore, it returned 2hrs later.  every single bit.  Lesson learned.  Well done from now on.  Monkeys still a fan, but with fear of this kitchen.  Monkey shall return for them Taro Pancakes.  One day...
4720	1	a	The same burgers as the windmill location plus a few extras they kept from when this location was Bachi HLK I am here at 6pm and the restaurant is basically empty. I'm sure it will pick up as they have just re-opened
4721	1	a	My husband and I have heard great things about this restaurant and with receiving a gift card for Christmas it was the universe telling us we had to go. \n\nWe asked the waitress what to get and she recommended the oxtail chili cheese fries as an appetizer. These were delicious and could be a meal by itself! We each order a burger as well: Ronin Burger and Black and Green Burger. We barely had room to finish it all. We will definitely be back to try it again!
4722	1	a	We arrived at this location after we were told the Windmill location had a 45 minute wait. Thankfully this location is a lot closer to where I live. We were immediately seated in a booth that we asked for. The ambiance of this new location was great. Table and utensils were clean. The menu was extensive and took us a few minutes to decide what to order. I ordered the Ronin Burger. It was delicious. The presentation was well executed. We also ordered salt & pepper fries; the menu is a la carte. The fries were served with a dipping sauce, which I forgot the name of, but was very delicious.\n\nThe service was less than average. It could definitely be improved. We asked for refills for our water and he only managed to refill my cup and didn't refill my girllfriend's; she had less water than me. I will definitely be back to try a different burger and hopefully get better service.
4723	0	a	I gave 2 stars because even though the food was good. The service was horrible. We didn't feel welcomed at all. We had a party of 9 and only 2 orders were served the way they were ordered. The waitress sucked. She clearly took the orders wrong and paid no attention to us. The woman who served us our drinks was way more pleasant than the lady that took our orders. At least she thanked us for coming. Due to the horrible service we didn't leave much of a tip. I'll stick to the Sahara location
4724	0	a	Two stars cuz the food is good. Why i give low ratings? Never make a hungry man wait to long! Walked in and got seated after 5min. What started to irritate me more is that no one came to approach us and ask for drinks or anything within the next 15min. Wtf! What pissed me off more is a bigger group got their fkn water and their burgers before us. Smh Thanks for making this hawaii boy disappointed on my very first experience of this place.
4725	1	a	So, I typically go to the Sahara location but we tried their newest location on Russell. The food, as always was BLOODY AMAZING!!! I had the Black & Green burger, it was NOM NOM & it only got better with aioli's!! We also ordered all of their fries, sweet potato ones, truffle fries, salnt & pepper fries and the jalapeno fires, the latter are my FAVORITE!!\nBut here's the BEST part of our dining experience, the service! When we arrived we were greeted and seated right away. There were a total of 6 of us but only 2 of were there first. Carla seated us with a laugh & a smile! She also shared with us that her co-worker had called out 2 days in a row; yes, someone will be AXED from there! \nOnce the rest of our party arrived, Carla continued to be a ROCK STAR! She was on point. She was pleasant. She was funny. She was fun. She made us laugh. She was just FRICKIN AWESOME!! Not once being the ONLY Server on the floor did it hinder her work or her personality! \n\nTHANK YOU CARLA for an AWESOME time! And we WILL be back to see YOU!
4726	1	a	I was speculative on coming here but it was close to where I live and there aren't many good pho place around here. \n\nCame Tuesday for lunch, first impression is that it's nice and clean which is always a great sign. Our server is nice and helpful, brought our tea out quickly, very tasty. \n\nWe ordered the spring rolls and combo pho. The spring rolls were awesome! All the ingredients were extremely fresh, peanut sauce was just right. The pho came out soon after that very hot which is just how we like it because we always get the steak on the side. Everything was well sliced, nothing was really coarse or carelessly made. Only thing is the soup could be more flavorful. Overall it was a surprising great experience and we will be back for more :)
4727	1	a	My boyfriend and I were very hesitant eating at a pho restaurant in the east side but the reviews here helped. It's very clean and the service is awesome. The appetizers are great and the pho is awesome. The soup itself is a little on the sweet side. This is definitely going to be our new pho place instead of driving 20-30 minutes to Henderson or Spring Mountain.
4728	1	a	This place is probably one of the best pho places in Vegas. Amazing customer service! Not like other pho restaurants I'm used to. The broth was light and very delicious. I can't wait to go back and try other dishes from their menu! Also, THANK YOU for being on the east side!! No longer have to drive to Chinatown for a hangover cure!
4729	1	a	This place took over Beijing Noodle & I'm glad! I am sad to see a local spot gone but the family that owns this place is cute. I feel like they just opened a place to serve food they make at home. They claim to be a Vietnamese and Chinese spot but I didn't see much Chinese except for the fried rices.\n\nIt has a typical Vietnamese menu minus the curries. I did however see they offered a beef stew with bread yum.\n\nBasically the food was good, the place was clean, and the service was polite. They could do to stop by the tables more often except to drop food off but I enjoyed all of the staff I encountered. Very sweet and friendly. \n\nWe tried their combo pho $8x 2, a ban mi dac biet $3 and some change, and their spring rolls $3. All came out to $24 and some change. We were stuffed. It was a bargain IMO.\n\nI really liked their sandwich. Their bread was hot, fresh, and crunchy. I've never had one like that. I want to say they didn't put the patte part. I have to say I didn't miss it, and I've been eating those sandwiches since my childhood. At first it looked like they skimped on meat but it was perfect. I loved it.\n\nTheir pho was good. It was a good size with a large amount of meat. The broth was good, the noodles were cooked just right, and it was served super hot. The bowl looked below average in size but it was just the right amount. I finished the whole bowl and the broth. \n\nTheir spring rolls were good. The dipping sauce was good. I enjoyed them. \n\nI have to say for a newer place I thought they did a great job. If they are reading and I could help them improve I'd say to offer straws for their water, get a napkin dispenser for the table if they don't plan to walk by too much, and lastly take their service to the next level. \n\nOverall I do plan on returning soon. In comparison to a Pho Kim Long, Pho Saigon, or Pho So 1 it is just as good but with the friendly staff you won't find in China Town.\n\nCheck them out!
4730	1	a	Attention!! This is a really cute cafe that just opened! Food is excellent, service is great, and ambiance is nice. I really recommend their rose oolong latte, I think it was the best tea latte I ever had...it was made not too sweet according to my request. Their baked goods are awesome too like the pastry puff that had fresh cream put inside when I decided to buy it. I had also ordered the salt and pepper popcorn chicken with rice and I thought the portion was really good, not too much food. I think this place deserves more exposure because I thought everything was really tasty.\n\nPerfect place to go for coffee, snacks, meals when you are in the NDG area, particularly near Vendome metro.
4731	0	a	After waiting for over a year for this place to open I was excited to go. I wanted to like it, I really did... And perhaps with some edits we will be back...  Oy beer on tap was Old Mecklenburg Brewery (OMB). Need  more options need, much better options... Food was just ok, wanted a burger but they do t have fries... Really? Ordered the BLT that was nothing special.   Fix the beer menu and the food, maybe you will get more folks in.
4732	0	a	Won't visit again.\nSat at the bar as with most places.\nTaphoiuse and bartender doesn't know how to pour Guiness from draft.\nVery small liquor selection...no Seagrams 7 huh?!\nBar menu...meaning limited selection of food.\nFish tacos got 3 but no side like fries elsewhere.\nFish and chips TONS of fries.\nBoth meals were interesting...flavor was lacking. Tasted like eating moldy bread ugh.\nCustomer beside was beyond buzzed and other bartender gave another wine.
4733	0	a	Mediocre food.  Took almost an hour to get 3 burgers and a Philly Cheese Steak.  The Philly Cheese Steak was supposed to come with steak sauce - but they were out if Steak Sauce.  Waitress said they had been out for a week. Here's a tip - Harris Teeter is 1 mike away.  I believe they sell steak sauce.  Another disappointing restaurant in a potential great location.  We had the OMB Copper.  The beer should was not very cold.
4734	1	a	I had low expectations and was pleasantly surprised. I hadn't read any reviews and had never been there when it was another restaurant so I based my impression on the location and exterior only. the place is bigger than I thought it would be. The interior is unimpressive. I went on a Friday night at 6:30. There was no wait. The staff was friendly and provided excellent service and the food was surprisingly good! I am a recent TC resident and I will definitely go back. The only negative I want to call out is the noise level. It was perfectly fine when you come with your family and kids but if a quiet evening is important I would keep it moving.
4735	0	a	Bon! L'endroit vient d'ouvrir et il faut laisser la chance au coureur... Je me promets d'y retourner dans 6 mois \u00e0 un an, pour voir s'ils sont arriv\u00e9s \u00e0 en faire quelque chose de d\u00e9cent.\nMais pour l'instant...\nD\u00e9j\u00e0, il y a l'am\u00e9nagement...  L'espace est tr\u00e8s peu convivial, d\u00e9coup\u00e9 en banquettes, avec des murs de s\u00e9paration, ce qui rend la communication avec les gens autour \u00e0 peu pr\u00e8s impossible.  \u00c7a \u00e9voque vaguement une rotisserie St-Hubert, en plus joli, il faut bien le dire...  Autre comparaison avec la c\u00e9l\u00e8bre chaine : des t\u00e9l\u00e9s un peu partout, branch\u00e9es sur le canal sportif.  Pendant une soir\u00e9e du hockey, je peux comprendre, mais sinon, \u00e7a n'est qu'aga\u00e7ant.  Qui aime \u00eatre bombard\u00e9 de publicit\u00e9 et d'information sur la carri\u00e8re de Wayne Gretsky quand il boit sa bi\u00e8re avec ses amis?  La musique n'est gu\u00e8re mieux...  J'avais l'impression d\u00e9sagr\u00e9able que quelqu'un avait synthonis\u00e9 CHOM \u00e0 la radio...  En somme, tous les ingr\u00e9dients \u00e9taient r\u00e9unis pour cr\u00e9er une ambiance totalement navrante, tout juste bonne pour plaire \u00e0 des banlieusards n'aimant pas \u00eatre d\u00e9rang\u00e9s dans leurs petites habitudes.\nC\u00f4t\u00e9 bi\u00e8re, il para\u00eet que la s\u00e9lection \u00e9tait tellement incroyable que le serveur n'a m\u00eame pas pu nous la pr\u00e9senter!!!  S\u00e9rieux!  Pas de liste des bi\u00e8res disponibles!  Il a donc fallu lui dire qu'on voulait une IPA pour qu'il nous dise ce qu'il avait (il nous a parl\u00e9 de deux bi\u00e8res, je ne sais pas s'ils en avaient d'autres).  Seul point positif, quelqu'un m'a dit qu'ils tiennent \u00e0 peu pr\u00e8s tous les produits de Simple Malt, qui est un bon brasseur.  Ma IPA \u00e9tait fort convenable...\nFinalement, le prix paraissait raisonnable (7$ la pinte), jusqu'\u00e0 ce que je r\u00e9alise que les taxes \u00e9taient en sus (donc 8$ la pinte).  C'est cher pay\u00e9, je trouve, mais il semble que cette escroquerie devienne la norme dans le quartier latin...\n\nBref, un endroit o\u00f9 on ne fait pas de rencontre ni de d\u00e9couverte, et o\u00f9 l'on paie trop cher pour une ambiance morne.  Je pr\u00e9dirais sa fermeture dans l'ann\u00e9e, s'il n'\u00e9tait situ\u00e9 dans un quartier hautement touristique, fr\u00e9quent\u00e9 essentiellement par des gens habitu\u00e9s aux grandes franchises, et qui ne rechigneront donc pas en payant cher pour une exp\u00e9rience fade.
4736	1	a	Las Vegas has tons of restaurants, bars, casinos, and even an unusually high number of grocery stores- what we need more of is book stores! Happy to hear that The Writer's Block has opened in the Fremont area- in addition to tons of books, they also have interesting and educational d\u00e9cor and knick-knacks like anatomical animal models. \n\nBooks are divided up by new releases, fiction, nonfiction,  and children's books with separate sections for health/diet, poetry, and lifestyle. Though the store itself is on the small side, it is packed with books and there is good selection. Staff is friendly, greeting customers as they enter and offering to help find specific items if needed.
4737	1	a	Stopped in around 8pm, hungry and tired after a long day. The owner was very friendly and recommended the chicken briyani to my husband. I had the qorma curry. The portions were generous and the food was tasty.  I do wish that the curry had a little more depth of flavor, however.  It was very slightly spicy, which was great, but there wasn't a ton of flavor behind it. The owner came over to ask how the food was and offered my husband more sauce to go with his meal. Overall it is a decent place to stop if you are looking for a quick, easy meal at a good price.
4738	1	a	For a quick simple sushi lunch, this is a good place to go in this area. They have a lunch menu that includes katsus, teriyaki, tempuras, and simple standard rolls such as spicy tuna. All lunch dishes come with a side salad with ginger dressing and miso soup. Their regular menu has a variety of nigiris, sashimis, special rolls, and some Chinese and Korean influenced dishes such as honey walnut shrimp and kimchi noodle soup. They also have different types of soups and curries. The lunch menu is reasonably priced, 1 dish around $8-9 average. The service was good and it's clean and spacious. Going in I didn't expect much, but overall it was a good visit. I especially enjoyed my salmon skin handroll. The sushi rice is seasoned well and they are portioned well as in they don't over do it on the rice to save the goods. They give a generous portion of fish. The freshness was ok, good enough to eat. One thing I dislike is that they serve tap water... boo. Overall I am happy this place opened. Now I have my go to Sushi place near work when I don't know what to eat for lunch.  Oh, they also have bobas!
4739	0	a	Stopped in for a quick dinner. Had the Sushi Combo 2 for $18, with a spicy tuna roll.\nFelt it was just alright, nothing terrible but I wouldn't want to order it again. service was great though.
4740	0	a	"#500 review!!!\n\nI've been trying to save #500 for a noteworthy contestant, but I haven't quite ran into anything outstanding for a few months :(\n\nWith that being said, my neighborhood bar/lounge recently had ANOTHER restaurant ownership change, and since it wasn't on Yelp yet, I figured I would do the honors....too bad, it's not a very positive review.\n\nFirst of all, the main reason I believe they continue having issues with the restaurant side of their business is the fact that the interior shares a half-wall with the neighboring bar which allows cigarette SMOKE to linger. It's not nearly as noticeable today in comparison to the pizza restaurant that resided a couple months ago due to the fragrant meats and sides, but still bothersome to most non-smokers.\n\nBefore I start on the food, let me first point out that this is GOOD BAR FOOD...just not great BBQ.  Let me clarify, if I was sitting at the bar watching the game, I'd be hard pressed to find much better bar counter food ordering selectively from the menu.  But compare this to the better BBQ spots in town, and you'll leave unimpressed...especially given their price point.\n\nI ordered the Combo Platter: \""Sweet\"" Ribs, Pulled Pork, Smoked Beans & Mac Salad. Ribs were TERRIBLY OVERCOOKED, blackened crispy & dry. Bones were BRITTLE & actually BROKE APART when given little effort. The Pulled Pork was good though, crunchy bits and smokey undertone, with the only complaint being the sauce too SWEET for my tastes. Smoked beans were a nice change from the norm, but the mac salad was forgettable.\n\nAlso tried the Chopped Brisket, Baked Beans & Coleslaw. Brisket was DROWNED in sweet bbq sauce that masked all the smokey flavor that was hiding inside. Beans were run-of-the-mill but enjoyable.  Coleslaw tasted like raw cabbage and water.  Where is the vinegar...sugar...flavor? \n\nAnd last but not least, the Fried Pickles. Some pieces were a bit salty and overcooked, but most were tasty and well done. \n\nTo summarize, if you are in the area looking for a good place to watch the game & some good bar food (and don't mind the smoke), this would be an great choice given what we have in the Northwest.  If you are looking for the best BBQ in Vegas, you won't find it here."
4741	1	a	"Phe-nom-inal with an extra \""nom nom\"" because you want to keep eating.  Inside the Town Center Lounge so if it wasn't for the massive smoker outside you would think typical Vegas Tavern Food, but it most definitely  is not! Stepping inside you are greeted by a quick service vibe with order at the counter and take a number type of service.  No sweat, efficient and I don't have to wait for the attractive blond to bring my beverage.\n\nFood was on the table (sliced brisket sandwich - $11) before I was finished filling my green tea.  Immediately I reached for one of their BBQ sauces and remembered \""Nick you have to taste before you douse\"".  Needless to say I put the BBQ sauce back and all I was left with was wanting to get another sandwich!  All and all, will be back, must come back! I'm even going to throw it out there, better than Road Kill Grill. \n\nBasically Bubba's brings a big Texas bite to this little Vegas watering hole."
4742	0	a	I have been in Austin for the past few months for work and I was tempted by this new BBQ place in the wilds of the Northwest. I came in today, ordered chopped brisket because sliced was unavailable and had the pulled pork. The pulled pork was terrible. Dry, chopped instead of pulled, drenched in a poor quality sauce. I did not enjoy it. The brisket was OK, the only part of the experience deserving any stars, but drenched in BBQ sauce. In Texas they let you add your own sauce. I feel like they were compensating for poor quality preparation. The Cole slaw was dry, the dressing was watery and pooled at the bottom of the cup. The baked beans had little flavor and were too soft from being cooked too long. Not worth the price at all. Go to Road Kill just a mile or so away to get something amazing, twice the food at the same price and as good as anything I have had in Texas.
4743	0	a	"Why? Why? Why...can we not get more solid BBQ here? Has Vegas been cursed by some sort of barbecue hating devil? Have the BBQ Gods no mercy on Sin City? I really just don't get it. But before I self-explode, let me explain...\n\nBubba D's is a brand new BBQ joint located inside the Town Center Lounge on Sky Pointe, just off Ann & the 95. I'm not super familiar with this lounge, but I do know from driving by it everyday that the restaurant inside has seen its fair share of changes. Not long ago, a breakfast place used to be here that I had bookmarked, and never got to try. According to Bubba D's, they shut down due to allowing guests under 21 to dine-in. Because they share the space with a lounge who's ceilings are 28 feet high, and it's way \""too expensive\"" for them to legally block off the area, this is strictly a 21 and over spot. So, for families with children, you're stuck with takeout only. I don't want to fault them much for the location, as I'm sure they're just working with what they can, but I really question why a BBQ joint would pick this spot. Even if I had been at this bar drinking beforehand, I'm not sure I would've wanted to spend that much money on what is technically just bar food. \n\nMuch like other bars, the menu is larger, this one just focuses on BBQ. Obviously there's classic choices like meat plates and sandwiches, but they also have some unique items like giant potatoes, tacos and even burritos. Tons of sides are available, although some are only available a-la carte, and there's a separate \""To Go By The Pound\"" menu as well. In my opinion, pricing is flawed and kind of all over the place. A 1/2lb of brisket alone starts at $10, yet a burrito or potato that they proudly display as weighing over 1lb, with brisket, is only $12. Sure, there's other ingredients in these, but how small are they making the meat portions? And because sides are separate, most of which you can not order with the combos, the bill can get rough. We only ordered 2 combo plates with 1 dessert, no drinks or extras, and our to-go bill was just a few cents under $40. I have no problem paying for good BBQ, we all now how much meat is, but they've got a lot of work to do. Here's what we got...\n\nI'll start with sides. All borderline terrible in my opinion. The coleslaw was either packaged, or made with a very generic cookbook. No flavor at all, and way too watery. Potato salad was just as bad flavor-wise, and I swear they put rosemary in it. It just didn't work. Then sadly, my most anticipated side of all was the smoked beans, and they were probably the worse. I had to scoop some up to take the photo, but most of the container was liquid. And that liquid tasted like straight up smoke water. Imagine taking a cup of water and leaving it in a smoker for hours upon hours, then sipping on it. I love me some smokey flavor, but whoa!\n\nHoping the meat would make up for the lackluster sides, we dug in, and were let down with just about everything. I ordered a 2 meat combo with chopped brisket and sausage, Lore ordered a 2 meat with ribs and pulled pork. They don't offer a classic hot link, but do have locally sourced sausages made just for them. My pick for the sausage was jalape\u00f1o, and tasted like just about nothing. It was drowned in sauce, which is most likely why, but I'll get back to the sauce. Both the brisket and pulled pork seemed to be smoked great. The meat wasn't overly smokey, you could taste a bit of seasoning in them, and they were tender with nice little crispy burnt-endish pieces. Unfortunately, the ribs were probably the worst of all. I'm no smoking expert, but they seemed to be cooked at too high of a temperature, way too fast. The outside was burnt black, yet parts of the inside seemed undercooked. It had a raw meat look and texture. And I'm not talking about the pink from smoke rings. 80% of the rack got trashed. \n\nBut here's the thing, I can honestly say this was my first ever backwards BBQ experience. In most cases, the meat at joints is what's lacking, but you can get enough sauce on them to make it taste okay. But Bubba D's is the only place I've been too where it was the complete opposite, and I wished there was no sauce on most of the stuff, like the brisket and sausage. This sauce is bad. Really bad. I'm not sure if the photos will do it justice, but the only thing I can compare it to is some sort of old, canned marinara/pizza sauce. It's thick, it's tomatoey, and it seriously ruined every piece of meat on all our plates. The ribs couldn't be saved, so that's another story. But I'm not even sure what sauce we got either. We weren't offered a choice (even though there's 3 on the menu), and we attempted to get as much of it off the meat before we ate to try figuring it out. \n\nI hate giving places like this such a bad review, but this was just bad food. The friendly owners and service is worthy of 2 stars, but I can't say the same for the eats."
4744	0	a	Dissapointing. Seeing the smoker outside we had high hopes for this new BBQ joint, boy were we let down. Meats were all overdone and dry. Beware, the meats come smothered in sauce. You have to ask for no sauce so you can sauce your own. The sauces were mediocre. My ribs were hard on the outside and not in a good way. \n Ordered both the regular and jalape\u00f1o corn bread. The regular was like a crumbly dense flavorless cake. The jalape\u00f1o was the exact same piece with a whole jalape\u00f1o cooked on top. Come on, take the time to slice up the jalape\u00f1o and mix it with some roasted corn into the batter. It tasted like Jiffy cornbread mix.\n The beans were ok. They were a bit overdone but had chunks of meat for flavor which redeemed them a little bit. The potato salad was the best thing about my dinner, on par with a store deli counter salad, didn't taste homemade. \n The waitress was sweet and I hope she finds a new job soon. I can't see this place lasting much longer. Sad because Vegas needs more good BBQ.
4745	1	a	Oh. Mah. God.... What an awesome treat to see this show! I am a broadway fan, but had never seen this play ( and had no idea what it was about). When we arrived, we were greeted with some awesome Yelp and Pippin items, a 10$ credit (which I used for a delish san tan hef), and tickets on the first balcony (which I had never sat on, has a great view, and is better than my usual seats in the nose bleeds). This show was packed with great music, amazing performers, and jaw dropping acrobatics... I even said it was better than cirque du soleil... by far! Thank you so much to Yelp, Lindsey, and Gammage for allowing me to see this fantastic show!
4746	1	a	Love this place! They have the best sandwiches and they have the best gluten free bread! Great service and great atmosphere! Highly recommend!
4747	0	a	Brand new location with the worst customer service.. And their fryers are broken and down already! Not to mention dude in the drive through laughs at me for being angry.. This business needs to be ran properly..
4748	0	a	More employees than customers in the dining room.  Hmm. \n\nFood is over priced and awful. I've had Popeye's before elsewhere ,  this is not on par.  Too many kids behind the counter not knowing what they're doing.  Chaos. \n\nGive it a few months,  try it out then,  if it's still open...
4749	0	a	Waited waay too long at drive thru before even anyone helped. Customer service is HORRIBLE. Who trains these people? Emily was extremely rude..so left without my food. We ain't in da hood not going back.
4750	0	a	"Just popped in to try their new \""Ghost Pepper\"" wings. Small pigeon wings and drumsticks that are battered and deep fried.  Thery are about as spicy as KFC original reciepe, but not as good.\n\nWhat is the point of advertising ghost peppers if it isn't spicy?"
4751	0	a	"Don't go to this Popeyes expecting fast food. They must have a different motto as the other Popeyes. They are extremely slow and by the time you get your good you are lucky if you get what you ordered, not to mentioned of its cooked all the way. The manager doesn't even seem to be concerned, only response they know how to give is \""oops sorry\"".  While waiting 30 minutes for my to go order I heard numerous other customer complain about the wait time as well. I get it has just opened but you don't have to have a masters degree to figure out how to cook and serve chicken at a responsible pace. Every other new restaurant has figured it out, why are the hires at this place special.  Would be surprise of this place stays above water, the only thing it has going for it is it's name. If you decide to go here clear your schedule."
4752	1	a	I have to agree with Brenda in that I don't think the Scrooge character was 'hitting on all cylinders'.  He did seem to be just delivering lines where the rest of the cast was fully engulfed in their performance.  Our seats- orchestra floor- were awesome and with it being our first trip ever to the Byham- we were SO happy to have gone.  I don't typically pay upwards of $60 per for a performance but this one, and getting to see the inside of the Byham, might help to convince me to do it more often.\n\nThanks again to Yelp and Rachel C. for the comps...!
4753	1	a	I'm a huge fan of musicals, but I have to admit - A Musical Christmas Carol was never on my radar. Not that I didn't want to see it; there are just many other musicals I have on my bucket list to see. After seeing this production (thanks to Yelp!), I am now a fan! \n\nI thought the set was awesome. The Byham has a noticeably smaller stage than other theaters in the city, but they made the most of the area. I thought it was beautifully decorated and made be feel like I was truly in the scene with them. Costumes were great as well!\n\nThe show itself was great. It definitely exceeded my expectations. I was afraid it was going to go slow and I was going to lose interest, but they did a good job keeping things moving at a steady pace. I was particularly fond of the woman who played the maid and wife. Her performance was hilarious. She's a true comedy act! I also loved the man who played her husband (he also played a ghost I believe). Once again, so funny! I loved seeing him come out because I knew we were going to laugh. \n\nPeople are criticizing Scrooge's performance, but I thought he did good. There may have been times he could have added more to his character, but he's Scrooge. He's supposed to be bland. \n\nMy only criticism (maybe because I wasn't too familiar with the story) was that I expected there to be more music and singing. There were only a handful of times music was involved and each time it wasn't a full song. It seemed like it was more or less used to help transition scenes. I loooove Christmas music so I would have liked to hear some carols. \n\nThanks again Yelp for giving me some Christmas spirit!
4754	1	a	Filip is Awesome, Very Professional, and Trustworthy!!!!! I have already given his card out to 2 friends. Please read my story below to better understand the automotive repair experience Filip provided.\n\nWhen I moved from Ohio I lost my very reliable automotive repair technician. For the past 8 yrs I have been trying to find a professional automotive (ASE certified) technician that understands what customers need. I have a 2004 Toyota Camry that was due for several automotive repairs so I took it to the local Toyota dealership to get an oil change and have them inspect the entire car to generate a list of the needed repairs. The following items were on the list:\n      Leaking High Pressure Power Steering Hose\n      Leaking Return Power Steering Hose\n      Torn Lower Control Arm Bushing on the Drivers side\n      Torn Lower Control Arm Bushing on Passengers side\n      Rear Struts leaking-Both Sides\n      Air Cabin Filter\n      4-Wheel Alignment\n\nThe price they quoted was ridiculous and was obviously out of the book used to quote how long a job takes. The worst part about dealerships is that they charge you for every hour the book quotes to make the repair even if the techs finish the job faster than the book outlined. Most repair jobs that have a repair list like above have some overlapping of hours between the jobs which is never recognized in the quote. The faster the tech gets the work completed, the more money they make(Both the Crooked Service Advisor and the technician). Also keep in mind that the massively inflated dealership repair shop rate includes profit for 4 parties(Dealership, Parts Department, Service Advisor, and Technician). After getting the list I then decided to search on craigslist in an attempt to find another reliable technician like in Ohio. Interestingly enough I noticed the Add for Flop Shop, which at first glance made me very skeptical about the place(My initial thought was chop shop?) but I figured why not just give a call and see what happens. Surprisingly, Filip answered the phone on New Years day even though Flop Shop was not open!! Yep that's right...this intrigued me enough to pursue a quote which he politely said he could give once back in the shop the following day. He did request the repair list I received from the dealership. The following morning Filip called me with a quote and I was very pleased with the pricing. Filip uses the same books to quote the hours of the work but accommodates by removing the greedy crooked other parties(Dealership, Service Advisor). Filip gets the parts directly from the manufacturers if possible so there is a lot less markup than at a dealership plus the warranties are always better. If he is unable to get the part from the manufacturer then he will search other local avenues for the new parts, even dealership parts departments, to make sure he can get your vehicle repaired in the timeframe you need. I agreed to the price and dropped the vehicle off on Saturday morning 9am. Filip outlined the level of communication he would provide throughout the day so I could stay up to date with the status of the repair, and he followed through perfectly. I always knew how the repair was coming along and when the repair was finished. In the morning Filip generated his own list of repairs and called me about what he found. Here is Filip's list of repair items:\n      Leaking LOW Pressure Power Steering Hose \n               (Dealership said it was the high pressure line which was double the cost   of the low pressure one)\n      Leaking Return Power Steering Hose\n      Torn Lower Control Arm Bushing on the Drivers side\n      Slightly Torn Lower Control Arm Bushing on Passengers side\n      Rear Struts-Weak(Not Leaking) on both sides\n      Weak Battery(Rough Starting)\n      4-Wheel Alignment\n      Broken Dog bone motor mount bushing\n\nFilip called me letting me know the changes(Low Pressure Steering hose, Battery, Motor Mount) and that the cost would not change because the combination of the Dog bone motor mount and the low pressure power steering hose equaled the cost of the high pressure steering hose. What shocked me was that the dealership didn't even noticed the completely blown out bushing on the dog bone mount and the weak battery. Filip noticed that the battery was from O-Reilly and called to see if it was a free warranty replacement and thankfully he was able to get a new battery for free saving me money and being stuck somewhere because my battery died. One of the other things you may have noticed between the lists was the exaggerations on key repairs(Leaking, etc..). Filip finished the majority of the repairs on Saturday and then had the alignment completed on Sunday. The car was repaired in the timeframe that Filip indicated and now it drives like it was new. Filip knows customers service and understands the needs of the customer. Filip is My New Automotive Repair Technician. Thank You Filip!!!!
4755	0	a	this review is not good because I can't even get into their website or get there a app to download on my phone...they say they're in Las Vegas but I keep getting a problem when I try and get a quote for a trip...help!
4756	0	a	They have suspended service in Nevada!  Only two stars cause they still list Las Vegas as served on their website and it took me 20 minutes to find out that is BA.
4757	0	a	My expectations were crushed. Phoenix needs a Tucson Tamale like place with a wide selection of fun and delcious tamales.\n\nAlas the Steamed Tamale only offers two, A beef tamale and a corn one. Even more confusing is that by default the non meat tamale comes in a green meet sauce.\n\nThe corn Tamale it self was bland and their normal prices are not cheap. \n\nThere are a few seats inside and a few dirty tables on the patio. Not very inviting.\n\nThis was a one time visit for me.
4758	1	a	New Szechuan restaurant with genuine Chengdu chef. They have a westernized menu, but for the good stuff look to the Chinese one. Dishes are authentic and inexpensive. There is a lot of variety to the dishes but certainly most are at least somewhat spicy.
4759	1	a	I came here to try traditional Chendu Szechuan cuisine and was happy.  Squirrel Hill is quickly becoming Pittsburgh's Chinatown- I read a review that raved about the silky tofu and pork intestine - I ordered and liked it-  but felt it was too heavy on the Szchuan oil - it pooled in the pot.  I also ordered the fish filet in hot pot ( a Traditional Chendu dish) note it is spicy-be ready with the rice-  it had the same sauce as the silky tofu was good but again had too much oil.  The two home runs were the water spinach with fresh garlic and the shreaded tea smoked duck with ginger.  Was not as cheap as I thought based on the other reviews- Entrees were around $16 they are large enough to share.  Service was fair polite but they forgot to serve rice and were hard to get refills on tea and water- I am not a fan of the utility of plastic chop sticks for picking up silky tofu but like that they are washable - I love the traditional family style food, large round tables and the thunder of the pins crashing on the bowling lanes upstairs.
4760	1	a	I have been waiting for a while for The Bar to open up and was happy with the final product. I sat at the bar and they had fast service great atmosphere (Thursday Night football was on). There is an abundance of HD TVs to watch sports on when I want to get out of the house. Very clean, approachable gaming bar, that makes you feel comfortable and welcome when you come in. The reason for the 4 stars and not full 5 was a mix up with my food order. The manager of the establishment came over and made sure that the problem was taken care of and made me want to return even though my first experience was not perfect.
4761	1	a	Great food AND service !! Food really tasty too must try tater tots with crumbled bleu cheese omg good
4762	1	a	This is cool place to eat. Great atmosphere and good food. Good people. Food has been great every time I go.
4763	0	a	This bar sucks. Wow I was so excited anout this place. Adam and most of the bartenders are literally a 4 out of 10. Even tipping ten bucks a drink there slow. I was so excited about this place and needless to say this place is a joke. PTs much better service. What a joke  to Las Vegas.
4764	1	a	Joseph is great to work with!  He has done our family photos several times and they always come out great!
4765	1	a	"I was the other patron with Scott M who wrote the first review. He went into great detail of our experience so I will limit mine. All I have to say is the drinks were amazing. The smashed irishman was an awesome drink. I love how balanced and uniquely crafted the drinks were. They go into great detail when making these drinks and they could be loaded with various types of spirits and you would not have a clue what was in it. Everything balances out to bring a wonderful drink to your mouth. Nick was our bartender and he was on top his game. He answered all the hard questions we through at him and explained all the different items on the menu both food and drink. Jason the GM was great as well. Very thankful for him to give us the ultimate VVIP (very very important person) experience before they were even open to the public. The soft opening is tonight and the hard opening is December 9th. I'll be back on December 9th with friends and other family members to say hello to Nick and Jason and enjoy some great food and amazing drinks and toss a few bags around as well. \n\nThis is going to be a great hit for Tempe. It will bring a nice diverse crowd and not so much the college scene as it will be for everyone. Keep in mind its no longer referred to as Mill Ave but now \""Downtown Tempe\"" with new businesses going up just off Mill Ave such as Postino's, east of Mill and now The Yard and The Lodge west of Mill. It's more of a district that you can enjoy vs a single strip of bars. \n\nLastly, parking is not an issue here. This is a huge bonus for them with an adjacent lot that has 800 parking spots available which is free after 4pm. You can easily park, play, eat and go home. No fighting for traffic spots and walking a distance to get to your destination."
4766	0	a	Excellent food and very impressed with services. The waiter Conor was awesome .I shared with him my list of food allergies and next thing you know the General Manager  Jason took my list show it to the chef and I end  up having a great meal . Very grateful Thank you.
4767	1	a	One sentence, so nice, so cool...
4768	0	a	First time at this club and I hear crickets. Where is everybody tonight?  Complete waste of time except for the crew I'm with.  Might give it another shot some other time:(
4769	0	a	Over rated hype.\nI have been here twice now, and both times I found the food to be average at best. \nThe first time I went, it was very busy, and it was like watching someone herd cats when it came to getting the orders out to people.\nThe restaurant is small, and gets real small with the crowd that has been there of late. You can get a few people in line to order, but then there is a massive group standing around waiting at a small counter for their food. \nThe drive-thru is always long, and in my 2nd trip there, I did use the drive-thru and watched people who would enter the place after I already placed my order, walk up, order, get their food and leave before I even went up 1 spot. \nSo my advice is go inside if it is a slower period in the day.\nThe food was OK. I had a chicken sandwich, that I have had better at other places, and some really nasty greasy chicken strips. It was hard to tell if the juice coming from strip was grease of juice from the chicken. I am missing something here with this chain and their food because I found it to be OK. \nThe staff working the counter was really seemed to be in a hurry the whole time I was ordering. Once my order was placed, I was told to stand to the right for my food, yet the person bringing it to me was coming from the left. Like I said before, herding cats. \nThe drive-thru person was just as useless it seemed to me. I handed her my credit card, she dropped it, I had to pull forward and stand at the drive-thru window to pay for my order. I could have gone inside and done this if I wanted to get out of my car. While standing there, she was telling the manager that I dropped the card and was the reason for the hold up. \nThis place should be getting a 1 star, but solo because it was not the worst experience I have ever had, and because the 1st time I went in it was REALLY busy, I am willing to give the benefit of the doubt. But the drive-thru experience was totally uncalled for, and really should have me giving this place a 0 star. \nI know this is a fast food joint. I know there is a stereotype that comes with the workers at fast food joints, but I would like to think that this place would break the mold and have people working there that know their left from there right, know how to grab something, and know not to b.s about something in front of the customer. \nFool me once.....
4770	1	a	I am a transplant to Madison from Va and while I love living in Madison there are many things I miss from home.  Chick fil a is one of those things!  I was so excited when they opened one 5 min from my house!  Stopped by the day after their grand opening and was almost deterred by the crowd.  Convinced my husband to stick it out with me.  Surprisingly the massive line took no time to get through and I got my chick fil a!  This is the only fast food restaurant I ever eat at.  Love the food and they are always so friendly.
4771	1	a	"Came in here because I saw the word \""cheesecake\"" & had to. (Haha) Very cozy and well decorated cafe. Very clean as well. The owner was there & was kind. We left with 2 cheesecakes from the case. Both were yummy! So rich & creamy! We will be back for random cheesecake cravings or to order cheesecakes for events."
4772	1	a	"When you look hard enough, there are some amazing mom & pop shops to be found in Las Vegas. Although a bit different, as this is more of a mom & daughter team, Gotta Love Cheesecake is a truly one of a kind spot...\n\nThe owners, mom Kathy, and daughter Heidi moved to Las Vegas from Michigan to make reality of their mother/grandmothers dream to open a bakery. They've set up shop in the Northwest part of the valley just off Ann & Rainbow. In fact, this review is a little bittersweet for me as they've taken over the exact same spot where Legends Cafe used to be. Sadly another great mom & pop that shut down due to complaints from neighboring residents. But luckily, Gotta Love Cheesecake aren't going to be running a smoke pit outside and are hopefully here to stay!\n\nIf the name didn't give it away, this shop is a bakery that focuses much of its attention on fresh, scratch made cheesecakes. Over 25 flavors are available, including seasonal selections, and they rotate daily. They come standard in a 4\"" personal size for $5.95, but can also be custom ordered in a couple different larger sizes (8\"", 9\"" & 10\""). For custom orders, they only ask for 24 hours advanced notice, and while not directly advertised, Kathy & Heidi said they'll also do just about flavor request, even off the menu.\n\nNow, if you're looking for something made in a factory, frozen, shipped and then thawed on location *ahem Cheesecake Factory*, this isn't the place for you. Every cheesecake is scratch made from bottom to top. Starting with the crust, which I think is a signature for them. It's thick, buttery and adds bother flavor and texture to the cheesecakes. The filling itself is silky, smooth and has the perfect creamy texture. It's also very flavorful, especially when you go with something more bold, like the chocolate mint. And depending on what you order, you'll get even more flavor with yup, you guessed it, scratch made toppings. You can really taste the love, and respect the time they put into their classic family recipes. \n\nWhat's even more exciting, at least for cheesecake or even overall sweets lovers like me, is that they're continuously looking to branch out with new flavors. Rumor has it there might be something with maple, maybe even a bacon & maple on the horizon. I may or may not have it had a little influence on that one. ;)\n\nGotta Love Cheesecake isn't only making spectacular cheesecakes either. They also rotate different daily treats including scratch made cookies, dessert rolls and other baked goods. And if that weren't enough, they also serve up coffee and over half a dozen fresh loose leafed teas. Top all that off with some of the absolute friendliest service you can find, and a nice homey feeling little shop, this is a must try spot, regardless what side of town you're coming from."
4773	0	a	I understanding that it's the grand opening but things seem very unorganized. The cashier in condescending in questioning everything you order. Ordering in itself is a challenge because you have to write down your order...since this is my first time here I was unsure on what to do. The gentleman taking the order was no help. \n\nFood: Amazing. \nPrice: Great \nEfficiency: Poor \nOverall experience: Blah\nWill I be back: my wife likes it so yes.
4774	0	a	I wasn't sure what to order so I ordered  one of my favorite side dishes. Mac and cheese. I was extremely disappointed it was very dry and bland. It cost almost 4 bucks im really glad I didn't get more i really was hoping that it was good.  The portion was a good amount , just lacking taste and cheese.
4775	0	a	Have eaten here twice and both times were a big disappointment. First time was for shrimp and fries - standard deep fried stuff and nothing special. I tried again and had the pulled pork with two sides - mac & cheese and the greens. The greens were the best thing on the plate which has to be one of the most disappointing statements one could make. The mac and cheese was dry and as bland as anything. The pulled pork was a disaster. The appearance should have been warning enough - unappetizing looking slop. The taste? I am sure there was pork in there as I got a very faint hint of smokiness from time to time. However, other than a somewhat stringy texture amongst the overwhelming flavor of sugar it could have been anything. Did I mention the overly sweet sugar taste? That was all you got. Sugar, sugar, sugar, sugar. I only ate half because it was just impossible to continue eating. And all that for $9\n\nSuch a shame
4776	1	a	Karen Berg is an absolute joy to work with, she is highly ethical in everything she does, very responsive and willing to go above and beyond to meet the needs of her friends and clients! She is extremely knowledgeable about Arizona's real estate market and her passion for her business and her clients sets her apart as one of the very best! I would highly recommend Karen Berg to anyone who is looking for a fabulous local real estate expert!
4777	1	a	We have purchased homes in the past and have always had issues with our realtors until we met Karen. She was very knowledgeable and even though we were very particular in what we wanted she was able to find us our dream home. Her professionalism and attention to detail when we made our offer actually made the owners pass up a better offer and choose ours. Karen walked us through the whole process and set up all the appointments which allowed us to focus on securing the loan. She answered all our questions and treated us more like long time friends than just clients. Even after we had closed on the house Karen remembered my daughters birthday and took the time to send her a card. Karen was an absolute blessing and I am extremely thankful to her for all she did for us. I will recommend Karen to anyone I know who is looking for a new home!
4778	1	a	Searching for good BBQ and Mexican food in Montreal has often proved to be a challenge for those who appreciate authentic and tasty options. After travelling around the Southern United States, and making a yearly voyage to Texas, I can attest to how good Tejano BBQ is. The amazing team behind Blackstrap BBQ, the only authentic slow smoked Texas style BBQ in the city, finally brings delicious burritos to Montreal's  food scene. All of their mission style burritos are great, but special mention has to be given to the brisket, slow smoked from Blackstrap and flavoured with a Mexican twist. You can't go wrong with whatever you order and I have been back several times to check each burrito off my to-do list. The perfect marriage of BBQ and Mexican Burritos, Tejano, which means a Texan of Spanish or Mexican decent, honours its name and heritage.
4779	1	a	My first experience of what I would qualify as true BBQ occurred a few years ago now when Blackstrap BBQ opened down in Verdun. I remember hearing about this new Southern BBQ joint opening and being interested enough to go on the first Friday they were open - getting in just before they ran out of meat - and being in awe of the level of smokiness and juiciness that the crew achieved with their meats. From that moment on, it was pretty clear to me that I would go whenever Dylan Kier and his pit mastery would go next. That thought process is what brought me a few times over the past month to his most recent project, a small burrito joint called Tejano BBQ Burrito.\n\nLocated in St-Henri right beside Bar de Courcelles and nearby many of my favorite different culinary spots - quick shout out to Campinelli, Rustique, Leche and Grumman 78 - Tejano feels primarily set up as a take out joint although there is a small sitting area with about 7 stools. The space is sparse - plain white walls with old partially sanded down wood used for the counters. Some smooth laid back music in the background. The menu printed on paper tacked above the ordering counter. The look is definitely in keeping with its older brother Blackstrap BBQ - functional and sparse with just enough of a style and vibe keeping with a southern BBQ joint.\n\nBut let's be honest - you don't go to a Burrito space for the decor. It's all about the food of course. At present, the menu is short and concise - burritos (regular and XL sized), tostadas, salads, guac, salsa and chips. For the burritos and tostadas, there are 3 meat options (smoked chicken tinga, chorizo pulled pork, rancho cumin brisket) and one vegetarian (black beans and hominy). Once you make your selection of a base, you can add either re-fried beans, black beans and hominy (if you went with a meat) and/or rice then a collection of different vegetables (pico de gallo, red onions, radishes, jalape\u00f1os, peppers, corn, etc...) followed by cheese, fresh lime juice, house guacamole, hot sauce and/or sour cream.\n\nIn terms of the burritos, all those options leave you with a fully stuffed burrito and a rather filling one as well. I tried both the pulled pork and the brisket options in burrito form. In keeping with Dylan's work at Blackstrap BBQ, the quality of the meats is impeccable. The pulled pork has that little heat from the chorizo and is wonderfully tender and juicy. The brisket is the same with just a subtle touch of the cumin which gives off a smokier element than the pork. In terms of the other ingredients, I enjoyed both bean options although I'm not sure I would enjoy a black bean and hominy burrito on its own - a meatless burrito just seems wrong to me. All the vegetables are fresh and crisp. Loved the creaminess of the guacamole although I'm not a huge fan of it being the only ingredient that costs extra to add in. Overall, excellent burritos that would be a regular lunch option for me if I worked anywhere nearby (which I don't sadly in this case).\n\nThe new menu item for me here was the Tostada which I had never heard of before. Basically, a burrito bowl - all the same ingredients pilled over top a crispy tortilla shell. The crisp shell was good but honestly, other than the texture change with that crispiness, it's not all that different from the burrito. A different presentation but given how I loved the burritos, I think I'll stick to those personally.\n\nReasonable price, good quality and quantity of food and quick service - All in all, Dylan, Clara and Co. have a great concept going with Tejano BBQ Burrito. It has only been open for about a month now but given what I've enjoyed, I suspect we will hear about this spot a lot more and very quickly in this new year. That particular corner of St-Henri is quickly becoming one of my favourite areas to enjoy food wise... I think i'll be visiting even more often in 2015!\n\nCheers!
4780	0	a	"No!\n\nI placed my initial order with BS and thats what it is BS! They entice you with a food credit or free delivery, but you have to purchase a minimum amount which is always $20 or more. I ended up choosing Southern Style Eatery for dinner and was excited to use this service. I ended up paying 18.22 out of pocket.\n\nDelivery guy Ronald was a very nice guy who delivered quickly, one of my entrees was incorrect so I contacted BS and was issued a refund for that one entree... come to find out it was a credit to my BS account. \n\nEverything went well until tonight. I placed an order for pickup from Chili's, I used my credit and paid for the difference. I sat there watching the tracker for 10 mins then finally started vacuuming. During this time BS contacted me and left a voice mail advising me the pricing on the menu was incorrect and if I had questions or needed help to email them or live chat. I immediately went to my laptop only to see they charged my card an additional amount, yet I never authorized this! When I contacted them via live chat \""Andrew\"" stated the menu prices were incorrect and that was the additional fee. I'm fine with the fees, but I'm not fine with being charged without being asked or told. THAT'S A HUGE MISTAKE! I asked to cancel the entire order and to please be refunded and Andrew stated he will credit my BS account... NO.... NOOO! Stop crediting my account, refund my GD debit card you liars! \""Sure in 3-5 business days\"" of course.\n\nBite Squad claims they do not mark up their food, THIS IS A LIE. I noticed Southern Style Eateries menu and the po boy I ordered was only 6.49... not the 8.49 I paid. Same with the catfish, I paid 10.99 for 3 pcs catfish and chicken and it should've only been 9.00.\n\nWhen I advised Andrew, he told me to email support@bitesquad.com with any \""inquiries\""\n\nAVOID THIS SERVICE.\n\n**Addendum** One of the co-founders Arash emailed me to offer a $50 credit if I deleted my negative review so they can have a \""clean slate\"" When I advised I could update my review, Arash said he would like for me to delete it instead. After 6 emails later, he said he would give me the credit AFTER I updated my review... based on what? During this time he stated the reason why businesses hate Yelpers is because we are all irrational and that 95% of Yelpers don't even leave reviews (Where do they come from?). When I would not come to terms with him and told him he was harassing me, he stated that I will soon be on the other side of the coin and that karma is a b****... This is also an issue in Seattle... Had this issue been taken care of when I first brought it to their attention, this would be a different story. One piece of information that he gave me was that soon enough BS Vegas will have \""over 4 star reviews\"" Funny how 2 of the 5 star reviews are from patrons living in Seattle... where BS is headquartered. This is all too shady for me. Delete your review for a credit? NAH."
4781	1	a	Tried it....LOVED IT!!! Will tell many and will enjoy this amazing service again. The delivery fee was reasonable and the service, prompt and exactly what we ordered.
4782	1	a	This place use to be called Tiffany's (check there for reviews). First time here the epitome of five dinner. I'm in freaking love!
4783	1	a	C.Love is a wonderful spiritual guide. She is inspirational yet truthful in her analysis. She assisted me in seeing the positive in my most difficult of moments. Her insights are uncanny. I highly recommend her guidance.
4784	1	a	I was looking for a medium to do a reading for me and my mom.  Love was recommended by a good friend and I am so grateful I got to meet her and be a part of such an amazing experience.  Love has a truly special gift and I was in awe of not only that gift but of her presence.  She has a such a calm, loving aura and I felt so comfortable with her right away.  I am looking forward to doing a Reiki session with her soon.
4785	1	a	C. Love Jordan is a truly gifted and intuitive healer and teacher. One could not ask for a more wonderful spiritual guide. Just her presence inspires confidence and trust. Whatever your healing or spiritual needs, you could not find a better person to help guide you along your path.\n\nShe is my Reiki Master teacher and has provided me wonderful Reiki healing. She is a spiritual jewel of the first-order.  Give her a try. I guarantee you won't be sorry.
4786	1	a	Drove past last night and noticed a new Bakery. Came to eat first thing in the morning to find out it was opening morning for the Bakery. I had the Apple Cranberry Oatmeal, and a  frappe Mocha. Both were very good. Oatmeal was a nice sized portion and very good.
4787	1	a	I work very close and often come for breakfast and lunch, The food has always been good and I love that they have gluten free options. It can be pricey if you do choose the gluten free bread though ($2).  I'd rather not spend $10 a day for lunch.  \n\nThe wait service is pretty attentive and I can tell they are trying to make a good impression.
4788	1	a	"Great stop during your stay at SLS, plus it's free! \n\nI was able to experience the Iconic Images Gallery a few times, both before and after it's completion and I must say it's a great reason to start using the hashtag,  #GalleryPorn. The works of Terry O'Neill are truly amazing and a fantastic glimpse into the golden age of Hollywood, the grimy British music uprising of the 60's, and the soft side of Agent 007. \n\nThe works here are for sale, but they may put a hefty dent in your wallet.  I suggest browsing the halls of the Iconic Images Galley and if your eyeballs are still hungry for more beautiful and thought provoking imagery, purchase one of the awesome coffee table books for sale at the gallery. \n\nRUMOR MILL: I hear they may start offering a \""Champagne Sunday Stroll\"" in the gallery."
4789	1	a	Another pizza place to add to my list of favorites! Before coming to Madison I'd never dreamt that pizza could be this good. I have heard all about Salvatore's but I'd never tried it before, the Sun Prairie location is just too far out of the way for me. But the people there must have heard me (and other pizza-lovers like me!!), and so they open an outlet here. Thanks to my co-worker I got to know about their opening and off we went on their second day. \n\nFor being a new place they were pretty busy. It was a nice and cozy restaurant on the east side (about 7 or so tables with a small bar area). Ordered the popular Carbonara pizza and it didn't disappoint. Runny egg yolks (3 eggs!!) and smooth egg whites right on top of the pizza. With mushrooms and bacon. With all the eggs on the pizza the crust is still super crispy. Enjoyed every moment of it. The small pizza was enough to share between two people. \n\nBut we were greedy so we also had the bruchetta as the appetizer. Fresh house made mozzarella with dipping bread, roasted garlic and greens on the side. I love how light the cheese is, it goes really well with the pizza. \n\nI am so excited about Salvatore's. Can't wait to be back again for more!!
4790	1	a	"\""Finally\"" would be the right word. It's \""finally\"" for those who went to its other location, and it's \""finally\"" for me, as I have been looking for a pizza to call my own in Madison for almost two years now. But it also isn't \""finally\"" in that Sal's needs to get on a west side location ASAP.\n\nI'm not into the California-style pizza with the garden on top, but their \""tomato pie\"" (regular pie) is a keeper. It's closer to a margarita in how the cheese sits next to the sauce, and that's the real winner: the flavorful sauce. The tomato pie is very well balanced, much less greasy than Glass Nickel's and much lighter on the cheese (around the same price, not a \""cheap\"" pie). I will still be back again and again.\n\nWent on a Friday night and it was absolutely packed. Hard-to-get-in-and-out-of-the-door packed. Lots of sad people are going to be waiting outside in the cold this winter as there isn't enough waiting room. Lucky for Sal's, I have a great remedy: open a west side location."
4791	0	a	What can I say Mexicans can't make sushi lol... Being Mexican myself I should have known better than to go there my baby loves sushi so we had to take her but I must say it was disgusting..... We had the hot wings and fries tastes like fish I'm not sure if they use the same oil which would explain the taste.... We also had the rainbow rolls they where okay I guess... The carne Asada rolls where the worst ..... I had two and asked them to remove them from the table ... A normal restaurant would have token  it off the bill seeing as it was hardly eaten but not this place I must say it was the worst 53 dollars i've ever spent and will I ever come back .... I DON'T THINK SO...
4792	0	a	i should have trusted my instinct- HOW CAN YOU TRUST AN ASIAN COOKING MEXICAN FOOD OR VICE VERSA??? but let me give you a piece of advise.. FOR you TO know if its a good sushi/asian restaurant  you HAVE  see abunch of asian in that place... the food /sushi and miso soup was cold.... \n\nservice sucks, the waitress were unprofessional ....the food was expensive and the food sucks...
4793	0	a	"Had been hoping for a good sushi restaurant in our little town, but once again, CG has worked its dark magic & given me yet another reason to head to Phoenix. The service was seriously lacking, the menu had no drinks listed (not even soda) and the 2 menus my bf and I received were both printed differently. To continue the inconsistent theme, all of my BFs food came out at once; the rice came out last WTH, 5 minutes later PART of mine arrived, then we had to remind the waitress that I had also ordered miso soup ( which should've come out before any of the sushi). Once all that was taken care of, my bf instantly noticed the over sized slices of salmon on his roll. While more is usually a good thing, if you can't  consistently slice fish (or any food for that matter) you have NO business being a sushi chef. The thick slices threw off the flavor consistency of the roll, and he didn't even finish his food; which has never happened at a sushi restaurant... Ever! He said the flavor was OK, not bad, but the whole experience was \""just off\"" and \""not right\"". My Caramelo roll tasted good, but it wasn't even sliced all the way thru, so ever other time I picked up a bite, it unwrapped the next piece.  I ended up cutting the damn thing with a fork! That chef needs to go back to school and work on his knife skills PRONTO! This all happened at 2pm, so it's not as if they were busy at all. Just like every thing else in Casa Grande, Senor Sushi suffers from laziness. This town has a long way to go. Nothing will ever improve if the people don't take pride in what they do; no matter how big or small the job. The wait staff was far too casual, they acted as if they were doing someone a favor by filing in for them. They seemed lost, almost like they didn't belong. Won't be returning."
4794	0	a	This is NOT SUSHI! way to much deep fried and rice can't even taste the so called sushi!
4795	1	a	This place use to be a little italian joint with pretty damn good pizza.  Now it is your typical new american eatery.  \n\nDamn if wasn't craving a burger and looked out the window to see this place.   Awesome.  \n\nSo I cant speak to anything but the FFs burger and coke.    But mmhmm good!   \n\nIt seems everybody is putting their own flair on a burger these days.   This one had the red onion jam.   RED ONION JAM WTF?   Ok sign me up.  Anything with jam as an ingredient is a must try. Right?    But hold the kale. Im not a kale person.   Arugula instead please.   \n\nNo complaints.  Good stuff.   Heres the kicker.  Im a mustard person.  Part Polish, so mustard and sausage is my thing.    \n\nHere, they have legit course ground brown mustard.   So thats pretty huge in my book.    \n\nCheck em out if your in the area. If you are really smart you would eat here before going to an event at the arena and just leave your car here.   Atleast, I would. I mean, good food before event, drinks after with dessert and you parked the car for free.  Duh. That a no brainer in this guys opinion.\n\nUpdate.   Grand opening is in two weeks sooo...  Nom nom nom.
4796	0	a	My wife disagrees with the two star rating thinking it should only get one.  My thinking is: 1 for good service and one for cleanliness.  Even though the vibe (decor and music) is mid-nineties, it's well done.  The positive remarks end there unfortunately.  We ordered the Mediterranean Board for an appetizer and split the burger.  The fries (although greasy) and the hummus wasn't bad, but the taziki, chicken and beef skewers lacked any sort of Mediterranean flavor whatsoever.  They must have been out of salt and lemon because I've never had anything so bland before.  The meat was overdone, charred and had too much gristle.  No where near restaurant quality in my humble opinion.  The burger was sloppy and barely edible.  Bad meat? I'm not sure, but we both had stomachaches after the meal.  I feel bad giving them such a bad review, but their chef needs to figure out how to actually cook, not just create a cool menu.  We will not be back.
4797	1	a	Thinking I'd have a nice Italian dinner from Villa Francesca, I was surprised to see the new @7th Restaurant. I decided to give it a try. I sat at the bar to have a glass of wine and take out. Since it was New Year's Eve, they offered a good-ol' traditional special of  pork belly, collard greens and black eyed peas. The pork belly was probably the best I've ever had. It had a sweet-salty crust and was rich and tender. Decadent! The collards had good flavor but I did detect a wee bit of grit. The black eyed peas were just slightly under cooked. I don't like mushy but would rather not have too crunchy.\nThe service at the bar was very good.\nBasically, I will definitely go back to @7th. They have a really nice decor, great location and a good thing going. They should be able to do well.
4798	1	a	"Okay I must admit, I was a wee bit worried. Sneaking into a building on a Sunday evening, through the back door, winding through corridors, following the yelp cookie trail signs, up the elevators, more corridors... it felt like a cross scene from TV Show \""Amazing Race\"" and some Scary movie. Let's just say that I was really glad to hear the muffled sound of laughter of my Yelper friends celebrating behind the doors of Centrale Culinaire! \n\nUpon entering, you could smell the rich fragrance of freshly roasted peanuts used in a sauce that accentuated a vegetarian stir fry dish that everyone enjoyed - so much that the plates were wiped clean! Meanwhile had the chance to stand, sit and walk around to reconnect with some familiar faces and got to meet new +1 friends (hopefully soon to be avid yelpers)!\n\nTo conclude the evening, we probably all ingested more than our recommended daily allowance of sugar, butter and flour by systematically going from plate to plate, alternating between cookie and a drink, to decide which was the best cookie - but heck, it was so worth it! Others were a little bit more shrewd and dove in, like an eagle, swiping a sample of each cookie and bringing the loot back to their lair and split the cookies amongst their team. Candy canes were dropped into cups of cookie favorites and a winner was crowned! \n\nRisa, thank you for organizing this memorable evening; once again kudos for originality! And to all of my Yelper friends: Merry Christmas and Happy New Year - Hope to see you at the next event!"
4799	1	a	Came in during the art show and was blown away at the treasures I found. Items are always changing and nothing is ever two of a kind here. If you are looking for that special certain piece for your home that no one else will also have this is the place to go!
4800	0	a	DO NOT SHOP HERE!\n\nI went in here on the evening of the Art Fest.  It was very crowded, as the space is small and it was a busy evening.  I saw a Felix reproduction clock on the wall and asked to purchase it.  To my surprise, they didn't take it off the wall, rather had some in boxes below the register.  When I got it home, I realized it was very poor quality.  Cheap plastic, not worth the $50.00 I paid for it.  A few days later, I went to return the clock and they informed me that they have a no return policy.  They said it was posted by the register.  I explained to the owner that it was extremely busy the evening I purchased it and did not see the return policy, nor did anyone inform me of it.  I asked him to make an exception this time and, at least, allow me to pick something else out as an exchange or to issue me store credit.  He refused to do so.  He was rude and unwilling to compromise.\n\nBUYER BEWARE!
4801	1	a	"Was in the mood for home cooked Chinese food and randomly searched \""Chinese Food\"" near this area. I recognized Liang's Kitchen from the other chains I've been to.  The location can be difficult to find for the first time. The main entrance to the plaza is on spring mountain road, and it's located in the Arville Square Plaza. The restaurant sits way back in the plaza, perpendicular to most of the other stores. We ordered 4 individual dishes and an appetizer: beef noodle soup, beef tendon noodle soup, pork chop rice bento, pork chop noodle soup, and wonton in chili oil.  Everyone was happy with their order, but the only thing I'd recommend is asking the cook to separate the pork chop from the soup to prevent sogginess. The portions were decently sized (I couldn't finish my bowl of noodles), and the staff is really nice. I asked for extra small side veggies that came with some of our dishes and the staff had no problem giving us more. Overall, clean restaurant, plenty of seats, nice decor, pretty good tasting Chinese food, and well priced (our bill was around $41 sans tax).  There's plenty of other options for Chinese food around here but this is definitely a place we would come back to!"
4802	1	a	I went to this place the other day because I love Taiwanese food. I really love beef noodle soup! It's one of my favorites. I have searched far and wide going to various restaurants. \n\nSo, my friends and I went and ordered green onion pancake, beef noodle soup, and green onion pancake with beef. I liked the green onion pancake. It was really delicious and flakey. I did like the one from Easy Earthen in California better, but this is pretty good for Vegas. \n\nThe beef noodle soup was amazing! I think it might just be my favorite. The beef is so tender and soft. I love the broth. It was very flavorful, and wasn't watered down. I would say this is best beef noodle soup I have ever had. \n\nService was a little slow here. It might be because the set up is  little difficult to see people because of the huge walls between each booth. I guess they didn't want to spend money remodeling the place. \n\nThe only downside is that they don't have shanghai dumplings. I was so disappointed. :(
4803	0	a	Went here on two different occasions. \n\nMainly came for their beef rolls and the onion pancakes. They're decent but nothing to be wowed at. \n\nService was mediocre on the first visit but the second visit was just terrible, aha. Couldn't even verify correct order or not because they don't put table numbers on their order forms so there's nothing to reference to. (We had a discrepancy with something we ordered and they thought we ordered something else so we wanted order form to verify.)\n\nService is slow so you gotta wave your hands around to get ahold of someone. Seems to be the case whether they have a lot of customers or if we're the only ones. \n\nFound a piece of plastic in my soup with the seaweed. Sighs. And the seaweed soup seemed crunchy/had that sandy texture like I'm eating sand or something. My friend has already said she won't be coming back. \n\nReally wanted it to be better but yeah... First visit was definitely better than the second in terms of overall experience.
4804	1	a	I was sad to see all of the Carmine's closing up around here but this small pizza restaurant/bistro is better than the old locations! The decor - photos of Coney Island, old New York, etc. - reminds me of my stomping grounds. The pizza is amazing. Any self respecting New Yorker who knows a good slice will NOT be disappointed. Slices are only a buck at lunchtime (maximum 2 per person) every day (not just weekdays). The garlic knots are delicious. Can't wait to try the zeppoles! We had very good service. Will be back often.
4805	1	a	I love these small, intimate Yelp events so much. This one was just the right size for mingling and relaxing. But someone must have told the owners of the Sweet Shoppe to expect an army because they had A TON of food for us. Samples of their made in house fudge, chocolates, caramel apples and nuts abounded. Everything was absolutely delicious (yes, I did try one of everything). Even better, they offered us 20% off everything in the store so I was able to get some stocking stuffers for Christmas... they even had a few sugar free options for my diabetic hubby. So awesome! Since this place is just a short distance from work I know I will be back.
4806	1	a	First time here. Have to say I my favorite thing about this place is the atmosphere. I love that every person working looks happy to be here.
4807	1	a	Been here twice now. The idea and concept are cool and really great for groups. However, the service is a bit slow since they just opened (it wasn't very busy- the bar was empty and there were empty bays). Still the waitress was super sweet. Really fun and it would have got more stars if it weren't for my second visit. Went in on a weeknight to get a giftcard. Had to wait in line 10 minutes for a specific person while about 8 other employees danced and fooled around the lobby. The system didn't work, waited for it to reload, didn't work. They tried it at the bar. Didn't work. After waiting close to 30 minutes they informed me this happens every night about this time... Then why did you let me wait so long? They apologized and asked me to come back another time. It would have been nice of they offered to mail it or have it waiting next time.
4808	1	a	A great place to take family and friends. Kid friendly. Would be great for a date night, bachelor party or corporate function. Great facility, great food and wonderful service.
4809	0	a	If you plan on consuming alcohol here be sure you have a horizontal valid drivers license. The concept of TopGolf is cool but this review I primarily to say customer service was not the best and very inconsistent. The point system is messed up and doesn't read properly. Here is my story: I walked in with my fianc\u00e9 and some family members. After being told it was a 3 hour wait for our bay we decided to get some food and drinks. Everyone was carded and received the drinks we ordered, we then also ordered some food. We received a text that our bay was ready way before 3 hours. As we are about to head to our bay our food comes. No one offered to deliver our food and we also were charged more for our bill (later we were charged properly). We go up to our bay and ordered some drinks for while we play. The waitress tells my fianc\u00e9 that she can not serve her alcohol because her VALID US DRIVERS LICENSE is past 30 days from when she turned 21. (Our licenses do not expire until 2019 so there is no need to get a horizontal license and we have been receiving alcohol our entire vacation). The managers eventually came and were very rude about the situation. Our group understands the drinking laws of Arizona but our point is we were literally served alcohol earlier in our visit to TopGolf. In the end it was a lot of fun besides the first hour we spent there. The place is super disorganized and needs a to understand the concept of customer service. Our point is make the rules of the establishment consistent in the entire building. If you have made it this far, thanks for reading. If you are an employee of TopGolf please do not contact me as I am uninterested in any thing you have to say.\n\nTaren, I understand that it's a law by the state of Arizona but our point is you DID serve us with our vertical IDs just moment before we went upstairs.
4810	0	a	This place is clearly a man cave kind of things. I mean, yeah, it says golf right in the name, but I had intel that it was supposedly a nightclub/bar/music kind of scene.\n\nOh well, okay. There were bars, there was music, there was no nightclub in sight, the elevator didn't work and they didn't have heaters at their outside terrace. \n\nThe selection of beer was on par for a man cave, and the people were a strange mix. I totally didn't get the concept.\n\nA+ for the valet, they rocked. Everything else was just too confusing. I recommend this for men, though, because: golf.
4811	0	a	"I'm not much of a golfer myself,  but went along with friends and family for a fun afternoon. The building is elegant and the golf setup was really cool. Food was goodish (made up word) and beer selection was excellent.  However, I'm giving 2 stars for the horrific customer service.  That bad. This is my first ever Yelp review of any sort. I literally signed up for Yelp just to write this. Here's what happened. I was a waiter when i was in school and know the restaurant biz. The place was packed and I immediately recognized grossly understaffed. I tried to order a drink at the bar and got a \""one sec hun\"" from the bartender lol. I stood there for 5 or so minutes and gave up. My group took an 8 top and we waited for 5 or 10 minutes, but a server never appeared. My brother drew the short straw and went up to the bar and right to a manager (name tag said hospitality manager or something like it). He looked at my brother like he just walked into his house and asked him to make him an omelet. It was hilarious. You could see the panic and sense of urgency in his eyes. My brother came back to our table with this poor, frantic, rushing hospitality leader and he took our drink order. 10 minutes later we were drinking very good beer and in 5 min we needed more. No server ever came to our table. We had to make another trip to the bar - dammit.  Got Mr inhospitable again and 10 minutes later we had our drinks. Wanting food we made the mistake of trying to coordinate a request.  Had two separate servers take our order. We think the first didn't have the photographic memory we assumed they had because ink and paper wasn't involved. Food took 30 min which isnt terrible when it's that busy, but it wasn't hot. Nachos stand out if they're getting cold. That goes back to short staffing and not having proper expo. We then golfed and that was a lot of fun. We had a sever out there and he took forever with drinks and was unfriendly and unhappy. We were there for about 3 hours and I think I had 4 beers. I would have liked to buy more. I cant be the only one complaining about Top Golf's cust service woes and I'm sure with the amount of money they're making they'll get there act together at some point, but I won't go through that circus again anytime soon. The company needs to hire just a couple more bartenders and a half dozen servers and train them, properly. Currently they have an awful front of the house management team and wait staff."
4812	0	a	Well I took a chance on this place after reading a couple of review.   This place was awful and a rip-off.  I ordered the fried fish plate with cabbage and mashed potatoes and gravy for a total of $10.60 including tax.  \n\nFor starters they only gave me one small piece of what looked like fried tilapia from the frozen section of Walmart.   It was TINY.  For 10 dollars they could at least put two or three pieces of fish in the plate.  I think Shomars nearby has better fish than this and they give you a lot of fish for less.\n\nNow the cabbage was okay but the mashed potatoes were horrible.  They tasted like over-salted boxed mashed potatoes that were old and sitting up all day.  \n\nOverall the food was below expectations and not good at all.  Especially for the price.  They could have added more fish to the plate instead of one small piece of freezer tilapia from the frozen section of Walmart.  \n\nStay away and if you are hungry try going to Shomars, as they have way better food than this horrible place.
4813	1	a	Try it today. Excellent food. Thai Fusion with thicker sauces. Will definitely be back.  Food isn't like all the other Thai places. Treat yourself and try Table Thai.
4814	1	a	So we got the advertisement on our door telling us of a new Thai restaurant that open right a round the corner, so we thought we would give it a try tonight!  What  outstanding experience we had a the Table Thai Bar and Grill, the food was fresh and favorable.  We started out with the Tom Yum soup and followed up with Chicken Panang and Shrimp Pad Thia and we enjoyed our meal.  Every nice place and the servers are very nice and friendly!
4815	1	a	I am a HUGE thai foodie. With that being said, I found Table Thai through Yelp, quickly placed an order for delivery and was very satisfied with what I got! Upon arrival the food was still warm as if it had come straight from the kitchen onto my dinner table. The driver was very nice and even gave me some free thai iced tea for ordering delivery. \n\nFood:\n\n- The first thing i got was a yellow curry. For the price it was a bit small portioned but really satisfied my hunger. The sauce was excellent and had a bit of a kick to it (i got a medium) and had a VERY generous amount of meat in it. The flavor was excellent as well as the consistency; not too runny, not to thick. This came with your choice of white or brown rice. \n\n-Second, I ordered the pad thai. Once again this was on a scale from not spicy-spicy. I got a medium but the flavor was not spicy at all. Anyways, the noodle were very flavorful and all around good. They came with chicken, bean sprouts, green onion, egg, a lemon, and peanut topping.  \n\n-Thai Iced Coffee. Enough said. It was absolutely amazing. \n\n-Thai Iced Tea: Simply amazing. Wow.\n\nOverall, this was the best delivery thai I've had. 5/5 would order from here again.
4816	1	a	Table Thai was such a lovely hidden gem to discover on a night out with my sister! It's in a such a nice location and the vegan theme between this place and sunrise coffee is really nice. I ordered the Tom kha soup which was exactly what the doctor ordered. Perfect spicing and they let me order it with just vegetables even though that wasn't on the menu! Our waitress was the cutest thing ever and was clearly helpful to everyone in the restaurant. Overall we had a great experience. 10/10 would recommend.
4817	1	a	The Veggie Collard Wrap was wow!!!! So yummy. Tons of healthy options. I had the Green juice, hubby had the Energy. They were alright, but not the best I've had. The wrap was certainly a 5 star, but the juice wasn't as 'vegetabley' as I'd like.
4818	1	a	Great customer service with knowledgable staff that patiently explained the menu to several people who looked confused. I had my grain bowl and smoothie within five minutes after ordering. This is a must stop for healthy-minded people on the go!
4819	0	a	"My wife and kids stopped by tonight at 7 p.m. We were all hungry after finishing some Christmas shopping.  The place wasn't very busy at all.  Got seated right away.  A great start.  That's were it ended.  No one came to take our order or acknowledge us.  We waited for 12 minutes then left.  Another customer nearby told me, \""I don't blame you.\""  The guy who seated us smiled at us on our way out.  I just told him, \""We sat there over ten minutes and we got no service.\""  His response on our way out the door, \""For real?!?\"""
4820	1	a	Sunday morning christmas family breakfast . Was very packed at 8 am , But also had plenty of staff. \nFood was great and our server was also.\n\nNewly renovated store. Its the nicest Dennys I've ever been to.
4821	0	a	So I just signed up to yelp just so I can write this review. We just left this Dennys after waiting for forty two minutes to eat. From the time we sat down, it took twenty minutes to actually have our server greet us. I actually had to go back up to the hostess stand to ask for a server. When she finally came, it took her over ten minutes just to bring us our drinks. It could have been longer. The people sitting behind us got sat after us and by the time we finally got out food, they'd already ate and left. Our food, once we got it was noticeably sitting around. It was Luke warm at best. The manager Jeff should have noticed, but didn't. He seemed like a nice guy but when I was waiting to talk to him about the experience, he took so long I just decided to pay and get out of there. I was seething! I did talk to him on the way out though and he did nothing to try to make  anything any better. He seemed shocked like a deer in the headlights so maybe that was why. The only other time I had an experience that atrocious believe it out not was actually was a couple years ago at a Dennys in Memphis. It was the last time it'd been to a Dennys. And after today,I have absolutely no intention of ever going to another Dennys again. I did like the new menu though so it's kind of a shame. However, nothing justifies going back. And one of the reasons I paid is because I didn't want there to be any shred of doubt to that manager that was why I was complaining.
4822	0	a	We were a party of 7 yesterday 01/02/15 at apx 5 pm. The restaurant was busy , but there seemed to be plenty of staff. It took 45 minutes to get our order and what we got wasn't worth waiting for . Nothing was hot , nothing was fresh and my boyfriend was served 1 piece of bacon when he ordered double bacon ?!! Seriously? Who plates 1 piece of bacon and assumes the order is correct ? I realize going to a Denny's means you aren't going to get a gourmet meal, however,  I did foolishly expect a hot , fresh meal. Do yourself a favor and don't waste your time or money on this place .
4823	1	a	Whaaaat?! How many people in the White Elephant gift exchange?  50+? I am going to need plenty more of the mulled wine and cranberry mimosas.  \nWhile waiting for the gifts to exchange I managed to decorate 2 ceramic ornaments and a sugar cookie in the shape of a mitten.  I also sampled the nosh. Charcuterie,  a triple threat of hummus, flat breads and topped it all off with some sweet hot chocolate. \n\nAnother Yelp Holiday Hit! !
4824	1	a	Home from the Yelp Elite Ugly Sweater Holday Party. \nGotta tell ya, that parking garage took us two levels down.  So freaky.\n \nBut tonight, fun people and great stuff to nosh on at The Corner.  Got to enjoy some yummy Historic Piehole Porter -a Cherry Vanilla Porter from Flag, decorated cookies, participated in a white elephant gift exchange (lots of great gifts -some stolen too) and we even dropped off several donations for the Arizona Animal Welfare League.  Ya know,  Ive got a soft spot for the animals.\nFestive music playing - yeah, I was singing along... And I saw you singing too!\n\nEven got passes to go ice skating tonight or in the near future.\nI had to make a mental note of the funny sweater ideas for next year. \nDowntown just keeps getting better and making me want to come back for more.\nSO GLAD we were invited.\nThank you The Corner for hosting this spectacular event.

4826	1	a	A killer time, and I expected nothing less!\n\nThe Corner did a wonderful job hosting us! I'm down there a bunch for different things downtown, but I had no idea what kind of host they'd be for a Yelp Elite party. Welp, they nailed it! I'm so taken back by the generosity put forth! Tons of food, tons of drink, and plenty of space with a super awesome staff! Thank you all mucho for the party!\n\nAnd of course...there's the lady in charge. It's a damn shame I couldn't share a drink with you (read: adult drink), but no matter! Congrats on being on your way to becoming a momma, Lindsey! You knocked this event out of the park, per usual, with your hella-kick-ass (that's one word) team! Cheers to all of you!\n\nTo all my fellow Yelpers... Have fantastic holiday and new year celebrations! Each and every time I see you all in one space, it makes my heart happy. It was a pleasure spending time with old friends, and a pleasure meeting new faces among the group! Love you all!
4827	1	a	My first official Yelp Event was so swagged out, I can't help but to rave about it to all my friends! When I wasn't busy noshing on exceptional charcuterie (gorgonzola for days!), I was sipping on some fancy mulled wine. Every staff member was jubilant about explaining their product and seemed genuinely in the spirit of the season. \n\nOver 50 yelpers had tons of fun with the awesome white elephant gift exchange. There were some legitimately amusing alms to be found, and I was happy to see everyone having so much fun. \n\nYes, it was cheerful indeed. Everything from the immaculate Santa, to the make-your-own cookie station was executed masterfully. Big thanks to Lindsey D, and major congratulations on the incoming addition to her family. \n\nAnd an even bigger thanks to the classy elite member who brought me! I cannot thank her enough. =) \n\nFinally, glad to finally meet so many of you for the first time. I hope we can all do this again in the near future. If only...if only there were some way to get myself into events in the near future without being a +1. ;-)\n\nGreat way to end the year, folks.
4828	1	a	The holiday party was so much fun. All my Elf friends were there. I loved the spread. How did I not know about this place with all the times I have been at Cityscape? The Hummus was delish! I also liked the hot cocoa. Lots of good food, fun and glee. I did not participate in the White Elephant gift exchange but it sure sounded like a lot of fun was going on back there. What types of gifts were they swapping anyway? lol--\n\nI appreciated the skating passes and the decorating activities. My cookie breakfast today was nice. Santa was cool too. Thanks Lindsey and the Corner for all your kind generosity. Happy holidays to all my Yelpie friends. A word of advice? Pack up all those ugly sweaters now. Better yet, throw them in the fireplace. Haha! Mine to be the first one in the flame.
4829	1	a	Every yelper who liked to party & Christmas a lot, \nput on their Ugly sweaters to gather in one spot.\nStore bought or homemade with ornaments &  glue, grinches, reindeer, naughty moose, and a stripper Barbie too, \ncovered the sweaters of Yelp's Elite Who's who!\nPlus 1's, white elephant gifts, donations of doggie toys and treats in tow; yelpers followed their invitations to The Corner of Cityscape they would go.\nGreeted by the most photogenic red suit wearing old chap, who let even the naughty yelpers sit in his lap!\n We spent the evening eating & drinking coffee, hot cocoa and a cocktail or two; all the while listening to the music only the infamous DJ Sterling can do! \nOrnaments were painted, cookies decorated with frosting &  glitter, another Grinch took my present but I wasn't bitter. \nIt was a night filled with laughs, food, and  holiday cheer, Oh Santa I'll try to be good if you make me Yelp Elite for next year!\nThanks to The Corner, Yelp and CM Lindsey D. congrats are in order for her future yelper baby! \nMerry Christmas, Happy Hanukkah, and Happiest of Holidays too, \nAnd now to end my review..Wishing a Happy New Year to everyone of you! \nXo *The Grinch* Xo
4830	1	a	Yet another fantastic event! This party was nothing to sneeze at (even though it was a little cool outside...) they had different stations for everything- ornament decorating, cookie decorating, beer, delicious special holiday drinks, yummy pizza/dips/charcuterie, and even pics with Santa! It was pretty legit. Thanks to the Corner, yelp, and Lindsey for a fabulous night!
4831	1	a	Thank you x300 to Yelp for making sure we acknowledge the positive potential in our Phoenix downtown scene again. Honestly, if it wasn't for these recent invites, you couldn't put $1,000 on a line and try to bait me in that general direction. \n\nI remember a time when the unspoken rule was to get out of downtown before 5 pm. If you were there any longer, someone might as well have tossed you a Barbasol can so you could wait to be attacked by someone/thing. \n\nPlenty of activities for everyone and it was great to be able to explore the area afterwords. I just want to give a celebratory high-five to whoever hired that specific Santa because he was so engaging, ridiculously awesome with his on the spot photo ideas, and he didn't think weirdly of my boyfriend who asked him for a hug (I would have). \n\nTo those who kept complaining about food running out, the party not being accompanied to your 'no egg or 'no flour' diet restriction, how the icing wasn't spreadable oh what an abomination - if I could have rolled my eyes any further at you as I listened to your mumbling, my eyes would be in China by now. It's a tasting party with free alcohol, that's as good as life will get and it's all thanks to the folks at Yelp.
4832	1	a	What a jam packed holiday season! Finally got some time to get back into a normal routine of writing reviews. And I only have great things to say about this Ugly Sweater Party! The night was filled with Yelpers, food, drinks, gifts, 1 Santa, 1 DJ, and 1 skating rink. haha.\n\nIt was good to see all of the Yelpers together and catching up like a big family. The white elephant exchange was hilarious and I got myself a lovely shake weight. lol. And seeing all of the ugly sweaters was awesome too. They were so creative! \n\nOf course, one of the best part was the food. There were pizzas, cookies, cheeses, prosciutto, salami, smoked salmon, pita bread, hummus, just to name a few things. And wine and beer! And there was this cherry mimosa! My favorite was the warm merlot boiled with rosemary, orange peels and apple cider. :) \n\nIt was a great holiday party. One of the best! I love catching up with Yelpers and having that holiday atmosphere. The staff was sooooo amazing at their jobs. They kept the drinks being served, food being replenished and cleaned up like a machine! I have to thank the wonderful Santa and the electrifying DJ Sterling who always jams out for us. And of course to Lindsey who always on top of her game! Thank you for a great 2014. It was a good event to close out the year.\n\nAnd after all of the food and drinks and gifts... there was ice skating. And falling.
4833	1	a	What an awesome party and a great way to kick of the Christmas season! Unfortunately we had to leave a little eary so we missed the White Elephant gift exchange. But I really enjoyed the hospitality of The Corner and had a great time anyway. I loved the Piehole Cherry Vanilla Porter they were serving. That was a phenomenal beer. And I had never even heard of Historic Brewing Company so now I have a new place to try out in Flagstaff next time we go. All the bites I had to eat were yummy and also enjoyed perusing the offerrings in their market. If Ilived or worked downtown, I would definitely be a regular at this place.
4834	1	a	Fantastic Holiday event to end 2014!  Love the crazy Ugly Sweaters that made the night festive.  The Corner treated us to delicious eats of pizza, cheeses, olives, and salads.   We also were treated to several local wines.  It wouldn't be a holiday party if Santa wasn't there to spread the holiday cheer!  \n\nWe have Christmas cookies!!!  The Corner provided the BEST cookies I have tasted in awhile.  What were those cookies made from?  Yelpers had the task of being creative and making a masterpiece of their cookies with icing and candy.  I just wanted to eat the frosting.  Thanks for the sugar coma.\n\nThe Corner, Yelp and Lindsay....thanks for an amazing event!  I love the holidays and this event kicked it into gear.

4836	0	a	"Very excited that Tempe has this new breakfast spot close to my office at ASU. I've been here three times, twice on my own cause that's how I roll. As a single diner, I like the fact they've got counter spaces where I can chill out and not feel I'm taking up precious table real estate. \n\nThe food has been great each time, but it's in the area of service that they need to up their game a bit. I happened to be in today when their computers were down, which led to much confusion on the part of bartenders, who now needed to figure out how to run a manual credit card purchase (the nostalgia of running a credit card to get an imprint). Kids these days don't know anything about manual -- so there were five 20somethings scratching their heads. Kind of hilarious if you ask me.\n\nSo, after a long wait for my bill to be rung up, the bartender comes over to explain what this \""oldfangled\"" manual credit receipt was all about. Unfortunately, she didn't know she wasn't meant to write out the full total on the receipt, that I was supposed to do that so I could include a tip on the card.  Since she'd totaled it and I couldn't put a tip on the card, she seemed a bit miffed that I pointed her error out to her, and came to the realization she'd errored her way out of tip.\n\nSo, I then had to wait another 15 minutes to get a 50$ bill changed, so that I could leave a tip, and not appear like some schmuck.  If she'd told me at the outset their computers were down, I would have just paid cash at the get go.\n\nOh, and when you sit at the smaller side counter next to the bar, I think it would be great not to have people standing behind me crowding me out and hovering like vultures sipping on bloody marys waiting for me to finish my breakfast so they could snatch the spot, because obviously they are more valuable for the space than me."
4837	0	a	Decided to try a new sandwich place in Ahwatukee. The place is in the location of an old Quiznos and it shows. The young man at the register struggled to take our order and a older woman who I am assuming is the owner let him fumble instead of stepping in. She apologized however the staff needs more training before going live. \n\nNext was the price. 2 sandwiches, 2 drinks, 1 bag of chips. ..... $25.00\n\nYou have to order by crazy names on the sandwiches. Goddess, wet willy, etc. I just want a turkey sandwich. \n\nThe owner was running sandwiches and came to our table 3 times with other people's food. \n\nThe upside is that the sandwich was good but the price and customer experience will make me go next door to Spinatos
4838	0	a	Just fair. No one greeted me when I walked in, not clear where to put in an order. At least acknowledge your customers. My warmed up hot sandwich had lukewarm cheese and cold chicken. Not a great experience overall. \n\nTo be fair they did want to make things right and they are giving me a significant coupon discount to try them again. However I am not going to go out of my way.
4839	1	a	Awesome flavor! They use some sauce that makes the taste pop. I got the three wishes sandwich, stacked high with toppings, it took a couple days to finish this beast of a sandwich. Really clean interior and great service at an unbelievable price for how much meat you get.
4840	1	a	Great sandwiches. Generous portions. Clean. Great customer service.\n\nI took a sandwich home from here tonight. I had a chicken sandwich with marinara and cheese. I was expecting slices of grilled chicken breast, but it turned out to be shredded chicken. I didn't get to eat it until about an hour and a half or so after they handed it to me, but it was still totally delicious. I pretty much expected the bread to be a soggy marinara mess, but it wasn't at all. The bread they use is awesome. I had the soft french bread. Overall, the sandwich was REALLY good - especially considering how long it sat in the bag before I devoured it.\n\nThe owner and staff were super nice and friendly. The place was very clean as well. It's set up sort of like a Quiznos, but it's clear the quality of ingredients used here is far superior. They will pretty much make you any sort of sandwich you can dream up. Their menu online has 150 sandwiches on it plus a build your own. \n\nLooks like this restaurant is going to be a new local chain - I'm told they plan to open more locations. There are a few other choices for sandwiches at this intersection, but having tried the other places, I can safely declare this the best option. \n\nWhile I was waiting for my food, a guy came in and said he's been to sandwich places all over the East coast (and listed some States known for solid sandwich shops) and that this was the best sandwich he's ever had. I mean, if I was a real professional culinary critic, I would have been suspicious that they paid him to come in and say all that stuff. But I'm not and it was legit. I don't know if it was the best I've ever had, but it was definitely good enough to make me want to go back. \n\nOh, and they deliver if you live or work nearby, so that's awesome.
4841	1	a	We LOVE this bakery! The breads are perfect. We've tried Honey Wheat (deliciously sweet), Light Wheat (a blend of white & wheat breads, not as dense but just as delicious), Chocolate Babka (airy white bread blended with Ghirardelli semi sweet chocolate twisted throughout, uh ya, yum!), Blueberry-Peach (perfect for breakfast), Tomato Basil (elevates any sandwich), and their Ciabatta (spongy with a chewy crust with a hint of olive oil & salt). Their Carmelitas are addictive (cookie bar layered with creamy caramel and quality chocolate). Raspberry scones, cookies, & brownies are all incredible.
4842	1	a	A must see for families!!  My kids loved it!!  Amazing job this owner has done. The lights completely and constantly change and are sync to the music. to the homeowner , he was outside handing out candy canes
4843	0	a	The best mediocrity money can buy--that's the only way I can describe Showstoppers.  This is definitely an ego piece for Steve Wynn, producing a show for his own exclusive pleasure without any regard for Vegas demographics or the taste of Vegas show-goer's.  I am not a Broadway neophyte, yet I found the choice of material puzzling, if not obscure.  The talent is at a high technical level, but the cast lacks charisma, and the show lacks charm and humor.  The show would have been considered old and dated 25 years ago, and consists very much the sort of material I have seen in high school Broadway reviews.  Showstoppers would be very much at home on a cruise ship, but it is an anachronism on a Vegas stage.  Given what Le Reve has to offer next door, the ticket prices (close to Le Reve's) are scandalous.  The show will appeal to the 60-plus crowd, which is exactly the Vegas visitor demographic that has been dwindling in numbers over the past few years, so it will have difficulty finding an audience--I couldn't imagine recommending it to anyone, other than a Broadway buff in their 70's (and I only know one person who fits that description).  Steve Wynn has proven that he knows a lot of things, but with Showstoppers, he has proven that he is completely out of touch with contemporary entertainment tastes.  Given the demographic to which it will appeal, the show stands a chance of success if they cut the ticket price in half (with a further 50% discount if you show your AARP card), have a showtime of 5 pm and throw in the buffet for free.  It's a shame that in a town where a really new and exciting show would be welcomed with open arms, the man who can have any show he wants decides he wants a dusty old Broadway review.
4844	0	a	Production values and performers are great.  It is only a one hour show so that is ridiculous for the price.  Also they need more modern musicals.  I am 65 and you need to be a lot older to appreciate most of the music.
4845	1	a	Excellent service, great food, and value for money!!
4846	1	a	I called on Miracle Touch to help with my pings and scratches. I have a new 2014 and treat it like a baby and I like it looking like new. Ramsey came to our house and restored it back to showroom looks. I'm elated with his service and professionalism.If you need the job done than Ramsey your guy! I also like the fact that he travels to you and it allows you to get on with your day.
4847	1	a	Ramsey did an amazing job on fixing a large chip on my hood and scratches on my bumper.  I love that he came to me versus having to sit at a shop wasting time.
4848	1	a	Awesome new spot in Mesa.  Great beer selection and menu.  I had the Piehole Porter that was delicious and the Moosedrool Burger.  Hard to beat jalapeno cream cheese and onion strings on a burger.  Careful with the smokin' jalapeno wings, as they are spicy (just the way you want them!).  Finally a great place to eat and grab a beer in the Fiesta District area, the place has a really great feel.  Can't wait to go back and try the pepperoni wheels (picture a pizza version of cinnammon rolls!)
4849	1	a	Same great beer selection, good service and waffle fries--something spokes took off their menu..  \n\nPlace is brand new and some speed bunps will be:  \n\nWork on tv volume for football games, way too loud (get some sound dampeners)\n\nDim the lights at night, way to bright\n\n\nOtherwise food, beer and service were solid!  We look forward to seeing this place evolve.
4850	1	a	Cool new restaurant spot.  Menu is better food than you would expect from your average sports bar, so it's really much more than just that.  Great selection of sandwiches, burgers, appetizers, salads, pizza, stromboli and pastas.  1 star.  They also have great vegetarian options for pretty much everything on the menu which you don't find often.  2 stars.  Great microbrew selection on tap.  3 stars.  Awesome feel and atmosphere, with photos from the outdoors, traveling and adventure sports everywhere.  Decor has a modern clean mix of wood, concrete, river rock, aspen and an interior bike rack for your ride.  4 stars.  Great service, odds are the GM Justin will stop by your table to make sure you've had a great experience.  5 STARS!
4851	1	a	Hey now this is how you have a holly jolly good time. Good music, great food, awesome cocktails and a reason to wear my Christmas blazer?!? What! AND, I finally met my virtual Yelp BFF Michael N. I'm always glad when a restaurant has a meat free option so thanks for the hummus and salad. The self serve photo prop station was cool...snagged me a few selfiesh there. Great event as always and I'm glad that the head honcho was there so she could see how awesome Nikki is. MERRY CHRISTMAS AND HAPPY HANUKKAH AND HAPPY KWANZAA AND FELIZ NAVIDAD AND SEASONS GREETINGS AND HAPPY NEW YEAR!
4852	1	a	I'm always so appreciative that restaurants welcome us so warmly!\n\n I had no idea that IOS Greek Kitchen was open in Charlotte but it could be because I don't venture to the EpiCentre very often.\n\nWe donned our best Christmas attire because who doesn't love an excuse to dress up!\n\nThe bar at IOS was lovely and well stocked! The American Mules with ginger beer were a new favorite. We then stuffed ourselves silly on their Greek salad, bangin' hummus and lamb.\n\nReally their hummus is divine get you some!\n\nIf you you work uptown this would be my go to lunch spot- fairly priced and fairly healthy with a nice outdoor area.\n\nMy date's favorite part was the s'more bar. Nikki throws the best parties y'all. Love the idea of stickers for the best costumes too. Sorry for anyone I groped inappropriately...
4853	1	a	Nikki!, Thanks for putting on another great Yelp event.   I would have never known about the IOS Greek Kitchen if it was not for this event.     \n\nThanks so much to the staff at the IOS Greek Kitchen, you guys are what really made the night Great!  They were really fun, helpful and great to talk with. I hope nothing but the best for you all. They worked there butts off.\n\nThe food was awesome favorite sample of the night was the lamb.  It was done to perfection in my own opinion. I'll be back for that for sure.  The drinks were tasty and I enjoyed the American Mule the most.  The pink drink hit me pretty hard and had to back off a little on it. \n\nThe sticker contest was a great idea. It really helped to stir up the interactions with people I never met before.  Props to all the snowmen/women and the awesome light up sweaters. \n\nThe event was packed! Only little thing was that it was extremely loud, not sure I was standing right next to the blasting Xmas music but my ear were ringing like crazy when we left.\n\nThanks AGAIN and can't wait to see what 2015 brings!.
4854	1	a	How do you end a great Yelp year for the Yelp Elites?  Well, you throw a fun party and invite all the gang.  This past Tuesday is exactly how Nikki W ended the 2014-year in Yelp (CLT Elite Edition).\n\nWas it fun...heck yes!  IOS Greek Kitchen provided the perfect intimate setting to throw this shindig.  \n\nAtmosphere - Lighting, intimately dim.  Noise, with a lively concrete floor and other hard surfaces abound the decibels were noticeable.  Fun factor, definitely set to high, as everyone seemed to be having a good time and were engaging.  Festivus factor, the venue was appropriately decorated...now the sweaters...that's another story (I think Bruce K. and Jeff S. will be receiving energy efficiency guides from Duke Energy).\n\nService - Awesome!  The staff was friendly, attentive, and handled the large crowd with ease.  The drink servers were doing a great job keeping my glass filled.  I thought the bartenders were on their game too.  I even saw one bartender hand muddling some mint (to release its flavor), which is much better than just tossing it into a glass.\n\nFood - Well, the drinks were very tasty.  The American Mule is now my new favorite cocktail.  Who doesn't like vodka, lime, and ginger beer?  Communists, that's who!   The food is where I get lost.  Yes, there was food.  It looked and smelled delicious.  However, the line was long and I kept waiting for it to go down before jumping in.  When I realized that people were already looping the line for seconds (and maybe thirds) all that was left was pita and lettuce.  I guess that is what I get for being lazy.    \n \nOverall - I had a great time talking to old friends an making some new ones (Tara L and Ian H were kind enough to adopt me for the night).  I was even able to take another inception (scenario 2) photo of Tonya from Poprock Photography.  Merry Christmas to me!  \n\nA big thanks goes out to our CM, Nikki W, as for me it was definitely a complete night to another tremendously complete year with Yelp. \n\nI hope to see everyone again in 2015!!!
4855	1	a	Thanks Nikki for always putting on a good party!\n\nThis event was super fun.  I loved seeing people get into the Christmas spirit donning on their ugly sweaters.  Someone got really creative and was a snowman with a super cute tutu!  Kudos to your creativity!\n\nI felt that the venue was great, it was cozy.  Crowded, but not TOO crowded.  We had a lot of food, but I felt like there wasn't that much of food choices.  I guess I have just been to spoiled in the past.  I did, however, like the different drink options.  Their mixed drinks were definitely my favorite part of the night.  It was a school night, so I only had three drinks, calm down people!  \n\nAll in all, a good night.
4856	1	a	I don't think five stars are enough to rate on how talented and amazing Sergio is. The first time Sergio did my makeup it was for a high school dance. Since then I have been in awe with his work.\nHe is such a sweetheart, so professional and creates the exact look you want. \nThank you Sergio!
4857	0	a	My sister LOVES this place, and I probably would too if I didn't order delivery. I am home babysitting my niece and we literally live 2 miles away. THEY CHARGE $7.00 TO DELIVER!!!!!! Im basically paying for 3 gallons of gas to get a sandwich---AND they have a $25 minimum charge! ABSOLUTE robbery. I SINCERELY hope they decide to change this, because I am SO DISAPPOINTED in this. I will CERTAINLY not be giving a tip---which if the driver does not get the $7, shame on this establishment.
4858	0	a	Californian staying overnight for business in Arizona  for the first time, definitely didn't leave with a good impression. In all fairness, the attendant did warn us that the hotel was under renovation, but he said our room had already been completed. However, when we got to the room, it looks as though they had just done a shotty patchwork job. The cold, unpolished and exposed concrete floors were covered with a flimsy runner. The sheets, temp unit and furniture were dirty. The table, toilet, telephone and bathroom door were old and scratched. Although the matturesses appeared new, they definitely didn't feel like it.  The only redeeming quality of the hotel was the pool area, but even with that there were problems (the pool bottom needed regrouting). The minor upgrades (flat screen, keurig, granite bathroom counter) and friendly staff absolutely did not make up for the state of horror the hotel is in and I would never stay there again.
4859	0	a	less than a week later I received an unknown charge for $70.00 from a company I didn't recognize (SMELL/SNELL?) so I followed up on it and it turned out to be the hotel trying to charge me for the room that I had already pre-paid for on travelocity. When I called for a refund, they didn't try to dispute/find the fault in their error, which makes me very suspicious. If you stay/have stayed in this hotel check your statements!
4860	0	a	Place was dirty. Beer selection was not exciting. Food was meh, and overpriced. Not somewhere I'd take my family, or a date to.
4861	0	a	"1) Venue does not fill pitchers to the top. When we asked them to, bartender refused.  Quote \""this is how we're trained to fill pitchers\"" rather then satisfying a customer. Not to mention attitude. This business just opened and is not willing to make customers  happy. 2) we showed up a little before 9 and was informed that the kitchen  closes soon. Definite con. Most bars we go to have the kitchen opened until at least 12. Alcohol makes people hungry and the previous business at this location had the kitchen opened later. 3) asked the waitress what the specials were, waitress stood there with no clue and said I don't  know. So evidently staff needs more training or know how to engage/respond to customers"
4862	0	a	Short staffed, long time waiting for service. Although our server was friendly and apologized for the long wait, She was not knowledgable on specials or products. After ordering 4 pitchers with a group of friends and realizing a trend that they do NOT fill them all the way to the top, I asked the bartender to please top it off and she refused saying it's not their policy and she knows what she is doing. You should be able to get 4 full pints out of a pitcher, but this was not the case.  This is maybe not a huge deal to some, but it's ripping people off and the fact that they didn't want to fix the situation, was upsetting. You order a 64oz pitcher, you should get 64oz!
4863	1	a	I dont understand the other commenter saying this place is dirty and doesnt hve a beer selection. It has five domestics on tap and 20! Microbrews from a dunkleweiser to double ipas the beer is served at the perfect temperature. It is very clean. Dont let the name fool you, this is not a trashy place. Rustic but not tacky, gives off an air of classy yet blue collared. The servers are easy on the eyes and wear an appropriate amount of clothing to still be risqu\u00e9. 4 pool tables, 30+ person bar, and a large open dance floor along with tables and booths accommodate the bottom floor. The top floor balcony overlooks the main room and leads to an outdoor balcony patio! 30 big screen tvs litter the walls playing various sports and rock/country music videos. The fries are crispy and lightly salted and the burger is thick, juicy, and flavorful. This venue is bound to satisfy the down to earth men and women that populate the west valley. Would male a great weekend night!
4864	1	a	Dined at Cebu Inasal at least 4x last week--breakfast (twice), lunch and dinner. The food was excellent, well presented and just yummy. Great service by the very friendly staff! The place (including the bathroom) was very clean, I highly recommend this place!\n\nAnd oh, btw-their yummy leche flan is sooo cheap for a perfect single serving size!
4865	0	a	"So the family was really excited for this place to open and we really wanted this place to be our next \""go to Filipino restaurant\"" Unfortunately, it will not be a usual spot for us. We ordered the lumpia Shanghai, dinuguan, chicharron bulak, pork bbq on a stick and pancit Bam-i. \nThe bbq on a stick and pancit were both delicious. However when we placed our order for the lumpia , we asked how many pieces in an order. We were told twelve. When my mom picked up the order, they showed her what we had ordered, she counted 9. Their excuse was it's because the pieces were cut big. My mom, didn't bother to say anything. But excuse me, if the lumpia was cut into the twelve pieces, they would have been only one bite lumpias. Regardless, that should have not been an excuse.\nNext up, the chicharron bulaklak, we asked for it to be extra crispy. What we got was crumbs, maybe 5 small pieces of soggy chicharron soaked up will oil. \nThe dinuguan, it wasn't bad, but it wasn't great either.\nWith the amount we paid for the amount of food that we received, we could have gotten a lot more and better quality at another Filipino restaurant that we frequent."
4866	1	a	Amazing! Seriously the best massage I've ever had in my life. I've been to many top rated spas and massage therapists and Dana Marie put them all to shame. She knows how to work out muscle pains and aches with talented hands. You leave feeling rejuvenated both in body and spirit. It is amazing experience to be had.
4867	1	a	Love Love Love getting a massage by Dana! She creates such a deep connection when I'm on the table it becomes very easy to open up to her, body wise, as well as spirit.  I usually prefer male therapists, but Dana is the exception for me. For sure one of the best therapists in the Valley!! Please do yourself a favor, and book at least an 80 min with Dana, and be prepared for some amazing massage and energy work!!
4868	1	a	The most important quality in a massage therapist is their diagnostic ability. Finding someone like Dana Marie, who is extremely proficient in listening to a patient's description of pain or discomfort and then being able to identify a treatment approach is why I continue to come back. She is really intuitive. I can't recommend her enough.
4869	1	a	Bread made on site is delicious! Very hospitable owners, love the olives. Wonderful beef with couscous, lots of vegetables. Will definitely be back as we work very close to here.  And must try the house hot tea!
4870	1	a	My first time here and it was great!  I came in for a haircut and, having been to other beauty schools before, I knew it could take awhile.  I was pleasantly surprised when I walked in and the student who was going to cut my hair (Kelsey) came right out and got me.  She sat me down in her chair, asked me what I wanted done with my hair, asked clarifying questions and then called her instructor over to let her know what I wanted done.  After that, I got a nice shampoo and then she got to work cutting my hair.  \n\nShe mentioned that it was her first day on the floor and I got a bit nervous when I heard that, but Kelsey seemed very confident and capable and she cut my hair exactly how I wanted it (I've had problems at other schools with students wanting to cut it differently than I want it). I liked that it only took an hour or so and the instructors were readily available to help the students when needed.  \n\nOverall, everyone was very friendly, Kelsey was a great stylist, I got an awesome cut, and it only ran me $9!  I'll definitely be back for another haircut and maybe to try a facial.
4871	0	a	If I could give negative stars I would. I started to write my whole story here, but no one really cares. I got a really bad dye job here and the girl Yvette that did my hair was so mean and rude. No nice way to put it. At one point in the appointment she called me a racist. When I left the salon I had a yellow racing strip up the back of my black hair and my roots were dyed orange. How embarrassing for the stylist that did it. Take warning, your at the Fiesta Mall that should be the first clue... If your as cheap as me and want some quality, go up to Toni and Guy...
4872	1	a	I had a not-so-good experience at another beauty school and decided to try here.  From scheduling the appointment to getting EXACTLY what I wanted done was completely great.  I did not have to wait long to be seen by my student, which was great. The down side was that it took 6 hours for a spiral perm.  I blame that mostly for my long hair though, not the student.  I was hoping to be out of there a bit sooner, but I will still go back.  I love that the instructors are there, walking through the rows of chairs and offering help and guidance when there is a question and affirming the student's assessment of what to do next.  I see a recipe for success in each student because of the leadership of the teaching staff.  This school is maintained well and very pleasant to spend half a day in.  Even the students seemed happy to be there, learning and doing.  I will go back, and I will bring my children here to allow these students to practice!
4873	1	a	Going here was actually a really great experience.  I loved the idea of being apart of the education process for these budding beauty school students, and I even learned a lot myself.  I had Walter who had 3 weeks of floor experience, so the instructor stayed with him the majority of the time and really made sure everything was perfect.  I'm assuming that when they get a little more seasoned, the instructor will only check in a couple times.\n\nPros: \n - $9 Shampoo, cut, and thermal.  Can't beat that price!\n - $15 Pedi/mani comes with free OPI nail polish\n - Fun learning experience\n\nCons: \n - Expect to be at the salon for the double the amount of time it would take a seasoned professional (due to instructor check ins and slower uncertain hands)\n - Know what you want because they aren't confident enough yet to make suggestions.  (But they do a great job at mimicking your photo request).\n\nI will definitely go here again.  Everyone was lovely and eager to please.
4874	1	a	This place moved to this location. All of the reviews disappeared from the other location. The food is very authentic peruvian food. Recommend the Lomo saltado or the Seco de Carne. Or any seafood dish. Also try one of the many unique appetizers. My mom was Peruvian,  so  I crave this food.
4875	1	a	New location  but same great people and food!! Might be a little pricey but well worth it. As a Peruvian myself I can tell you this is the real deal so come and try it!!!
4876	0	a	I just ate here for the first time a couple of weeks ago, at the new location. I definitely had higher expectations for this place that it did not come close to meeting.\n\nThe food seems great for hangovers, but if you are not sporting one then you will probably think very little of the food like I did. It is also grossly overpriced. The food portions are regular and you will not have any leftovers to bring home. \n\nOur meal started off with the Huancaina con Camaron...which is described well on the menu. It is a boiled potato with one small slice of boiled egg on top. A few small overcooked and shelled shrimp. $9. They must make a ton of money charging people $9 for 1 potato and a few small shrimp. \n\nI ordered the Saltado de Camarones and my boyfriend ordered the Tallarin Salteando de Carne. My plate was french fries with a bunch of onions and some more small shrimp on top. $16. They did not bring out the correct plate for my boyfriend (which the waitress even recommended to us)...instead they brought him Lomo Saltado which was the same thing as mine but with a few strips of beef (on top of french fries and onions). $12. \n\nI do not recommend this spot unless you have a hangover and money to throw at basic food. We will not be returning. The only reason this spot got the 2nd star is because the waitress was nice.
4877	1	a	My hubby and I were on the hunt for something light and fresh and this place fulfilled that craving for us.\n\nIt is a simple and cool space decorated with small colorful frames with veggies on them. They have a nice and easy to read menu divided in panels, for what I remembered seeing they have salads, wraps, burritos, noodles bowls and green smoothies. Each panel describes all the ingredients that come in every item and at the bottom you get to choose your meat, they have steak, chicken, tofu or vegetarian. For me, that's a good break from the rest of the places where you get dizzy just by looking at their long and confusing menus.\n\nGetting to the best part, I got a chicken wrap called the superbiotic, it comes with bell peppers, spinach, chick peas, artichoke hearts, sundried tomatoes (which I would have preferred rehydrated, they felt like a bumpy road in my mouth) and a cucumber dill dressing, everything tasted nice and fresh (as the name states, freshii). My hubby got a steak burrito and he said it was ok, he though it needed some kind of dressing since it just came with a little bit of avocado and beans. They also got natural juices and coconut water (I got one) and I liked it a lot, the brand was Buddha, it was from Thailand. I will be back for more :)
4878	1	a	Located in the Vegas Hot building! New owners and no longer affiliated* \n\nIf you don't see it on the menu, They say they will make you anything you want. :)
4879	1	a	The old fresh mama. Super good food. Get the veggie skewers. Can't wait to see what they can do when they expand. Will be back
4880	1	a	I am so excited that Sephora is now located in Downtown Summerlin!  I attended my first VIB Rouge event in November and I felt like a princess!  Employees greeted me, did a free makeover, helped me shop as if I were the only one in the store!  They were slammed for the event!  Wendy, Destiny, Moriah, Carol, Toni are just to name a few!  They are always giving me free samples and advice on skincare!  Thank you so much for all of my makeovers and customer service that is beyond the call of duty!  \n\nThe PodBrother Show:  http://youtu.be/S0Lusii7Tl0
4881	1	a	Finally! Shake shack opened their doors! It has a very nice interior and patio sitting. Its located between  outside of nyny and monte carlo, so its way better to park at nyny and go through the food court. \n\nBest burger ive had in east side and finally now here in vegas!!! I highly recommend the SHAKE STACK and second the SHROOM BURGER. i love how the cheese will oooooozzzeee out once you bite onto your burger, one word, BOMBDIGGITTY! \n\nAlso, their staff was very attentive and friendly! Please keep it up guys! Good service good food! ;)
4882	1	a	I love Shake Shack! Always good anytime everytime. I once stood in line for 2 hours in NYC for Shake Shack burger. Thanks for opening in Vegas.
4883	1	a	I've tried Shake N Shack in Miami, DC, and Las Vegas. It was all perfect! Love it and enjoy it!
4884	1	a	After seeing the line out the door and seeing other reviews we had to try it.  ShackBurger and fries were good.  Ordered a root beer float but they were out of root beer.  Fun atmosphere.
4885	1	a	Now I never have to move back to NYC. When I heard Shake Shack would be opening a location in NYNY I patiently waited for months to be reunited with the best burger ever. In and Out can't compete the burger, the bun,  it's all way better. The crinkle cut cheese fries are phenomenal. Who am I kidding everything is great. \n\nYea there are lines and wait can sometimes be long but it's worth it, it will always be worth it. \n\nDo yourself a favor drive to the strip and grab a burger but note the date and time, because you will remember this burger forever.
4886	0	a	"I was asked by Shake Shack to email them about my experience since I didn't rate them too well on my IG. I figure I'd copy and paste a portion of my email to them:\n\nI had gone earlier today to see what all the hype was about. I liked what I saw on the menu and wanted to order the double SmokeShack and was told that you had run out of bacon (it was roughly 11:30am). Fine. I also ordered one order of fries and a concrete shake (I forgot the name, but it included chocolate truffle cookie dough, which I was told was also out of stock). Fine. Replace it with peanut butter. My total was a tad over $19. $19? This better be the best burger in the world. That is WAY overpriced for any kind of burger meal.\n\nSo I wait and finally get my burger....\n\nWhere's the other patty? I went to the counter and notified them of their mistake. They apologized profusely and said they'd have my double right away. To my horror, however, they took the single and tossed it straight to the trash. A perfectly good burger. Apparently the profit margin is immense if your employees are willing to toss a perfectly good burger  away.\n\nI finally sit down with my double SmokeShack, minus the bacon. I bite into it and the burger was nicely seasoned. Nothing about the meat screamed \""unique\"", as there was no special seasoning to differentiate it from your competitors. The peppers were a nice touch and the bread was light and airy (which could also be a detriment due to the burger's juices almost making it soggy). It wasn't amazing overall, but it wasn't terrible either. I would rate the burger a tad bit lower than an In n Out burger and better than a Five Guys burger. The fries were done well. The shake was ok too. \n\nWas it worth the $19 price tag? Hell no. The overall meal had the quality of a hole-in-the-wall, $8 meal. Speed of service and customer service quality is definitely not the issue. I was served quickly and politely, even though the line was long. It was the price, the lack of preparedness/ingredients, and the willingness to waste food so nonchalantly turned me off to the whole experience.\n\nMy friends had told me about the mushroom burger and how good it was. I'm not sure if I want to try it when my meal's going to cost me the same price as a meal for 3 at some of your competitors."
4887	0	a	"Unforgettable experience - salty fries and burger to saggy. We order there supposedly famous ice cream in a big container but with no lead on it. We are family of 8 from California we feel that we mistreated. The location looks decent compares to other burger chain but may be becouse its new \""Hope will be Maintained \"""
4888	1	a	Went in to see what all the buzz is about and Shake Shack was definitely worth the trip! The restaurant itself is so nice and well-designed, I loved it. The food was awesome. I would compare the juiciness of the burger to SmashBurger - it almost melts in your mouth. The staff was very friendly and we even got some free fries thanks to a really nice employee. Overall, I was pretty impressed!
4889	1	a	The best!! Been wanting to try them since my foodie friends have been posting them.  I'm so glad they opened one while I was in Vegas.   The burgers were excellent and the shack sauce was delicious.   I love the cheese fries. Tried the salted caramel frozen pudding. It was creamy.  I took 1 star off because they only have Red Velvet on the 3rd week of the month.  I was pretty disappointed on that cuz I really wanted try it.   They need to open one up in LA, ASAP so I can try the red velvet.   Will definitely come back again.
4890	1	a	I've always heard about Shake Shack from all my friends who have visited New York but never got the chance to try. Super happy they decided to open one in Vegas even though I live in California :') \n\nStopped by here over the weekend on my way to Utah. Once you walk in they take you through a Disneyland type waiting line. The girl who took my order was super sweet and helped me pick out a burger since it was my first time.\n\nI ordered the Shack Stack a cheeseburger combined with the shroom burger which has a delicious crispy portobello mushroom filled with both ooey goodness of melted cheeses and muenster cheeses topped with lettuce and tomato. SO SO GOOD!! Especially with their shacksauce! Must try!!\n\nI also had a side order of their fries that I sprinkled with a bunch of pepper and dipped in ketchup, my fave :') I can't wait to visit Vegas again and stop by shack stack and try all the other things on their menu!!
4891	1	a	Very tasty! I'm in love with their brioche bun which is very soft and moist, and the bun is not cut across all the way so when ur eating the ingredients are not going to fall out the other side, genius! They have a special Shack sauce, which actually kinda tastes like garlic infused mayonnaise. The Shack burger will come with cheese, tomatoes, and lettuce, but if u want to add pickles or onions, they most definitely can. The cheese fries sauce are hot when they are served to you which makes it so much better, it's sort of similar to a nacho cheese. \n\nThere are of course tables to sit at but there are also some lounge areas without a table. But I don't see it being a problem since your food is served to you on a metal tray which u can set in ur lap. Service is very friendly. It is located right outside the New York New York hotel right by the Brooklyn Bridge.
4892	1	a	This isn't in n out but good so eat here to help their business yummy and get the concrete custard thingies and crinkle fries
4893	0	a	Very rude staff, also yelling over each other... food was mediokre at best, will not be back
4894	0	a	First off... know that you will be charged another $10 dollars just to PARK!. Basic ticket price is $37.50 per person (everyone over 12 yrs). Is it worth it? a reluctant yea.. there are a lot of inter-active games and displays. I bought tickets 4-5 weeks ago, and was so excited that it was opening here, just a mile away! If the tickets were a little cheaper I would go again, but now it's off my bucket list, i'm not going back. A lot of work and thought went into this event, nicely done and great staff. Bring a jacket, it's cold throughout. Bring the kids, it's more for them. I was told it was targeted to the adults, but that was lack-lustered for my tastes. First room they have you stand in front of a green screen for a picture, but give you no input on how or what it is for, they need to put samples of the three backdrop pictures up front so you can have a small idea of the finish product. They have cafe food on-site, which we didn't try, there is a lot to take in, you can spent a quite of a bit of time just reading everything. Yes there are restrooms inside (outside) available. My biggest disappointment is that I was expecting props from the Marvel movies, and backdrops, more museum type pieces, there was none. The simulators that held my interest were the 'Holo-Blaster Training Simulator' and the 'Black Widow Agility Maze'. There was an 'Avengers Encounter' that would not work at all for me, maybe because I was wearing dark clothes and black jacket, so the computer had a hard time in seeing my movements, not sure. At times it just seemed 'hokey', good-hearted but hokey, and you reflect on the money you spent to walk through. The Marvel Experience collects a LOT of information about you, and get ready to input your email address in their interactive displays everywhere. I own a couple restaurants and maybe I should start charging a $10 per car fee since you're already spending money at my place? That is sooo retarded, shame on you for not putting that in your website, or with ticketmaster. I carry just credit cards anymore... you need to bring cold hard cash and lots of it.
4895	0	a	Expensive, more for parking ($10), unorganized and line after line. It took 45 minutes just to get up to the registration with our bands to track the experience. Finally able to register, one of our bands didn't work. When I asked the attendant she said only 50% work and it isn't necessary to track... Don't wait in line to do it for that reason alone.\n\nFrom there we stood in another long line to get in, where there was another long line. Finally into the first area all of the lines were a good 30 minutes to try an interactive game, which we saw weren't working properly for those playing anyways.\n\nOn with the experience... We waited in line to go into a holding room which led to another holding room and more ahead. Not worth the wait unless you have children. It was advertised as entertaining for adults but I disagree. 4 hours later we made it through, tired and disappointed. We didn't even get to experience 3D because there was a glitch. Every time we went to a new area I thought to myself, it's okay, the next part is when it will pick up. It never happened though. \n\nBetween everything breaking down and 75% of it just being standing in a line, I would not recommend this for the price you pay. The one nice thing I can say is the staff was kind during the frustration, even though it was clear there was quite a bit of confusion/glitches on their end, they rolled with the punches. Overall, colossal waste of money and time. This experience must have been designed by Hydra...
4896	0	a	"We had tickets to the 10am experience.  Should have just gotten a refund when our original tickets (12/13) were canceled. That was a cluster-f in itself with Ticketmaster and our original tickets. \n\n$10 parking that you don't find out until you get to the dirt lot you park in. Couldn't bring in stroller for our 2.5 year old. The registration keyosks, about 60% were broken. Probably because those tablets cannot be in the sun. Whoever planned the setup didn't think that one through. A full canopy rather than an awning for the trailers, would have prevented the registration process fiasco. That and there was no sight of IT (though the staff knew there was an issue) until people started complaining loudly.\n\nStood around waiting at least 30 minutes to reregister (cause it wasn't recognizing our userid/pass we set up online). The quinjet area broke down and we ended up waiting in the \""hangar\"" for 40 minutes. The 3d dome area had problems, so we weren't able to use the 3d glasses. Couldn't experience the 4d ride cause of height limitations, which we weren't informed about until we were in the room. Not very young child (5 and under) friendly as there wasn't a lot that my son was able to participate in.  \n\nThough i didnt know what to expect, i was not prepared for this huge of a disappointment. Very VERY unhappy with the experience!!!"
4897	0	a	"Note: I rated this one-star because I can't give it less.\n\nMy wife Jill and I went to this at ten this morning.  First, let's talk about how we almost didn't make it because Hero Ventures and TicketMaster never got their act together.  When they postponed opening the event for a week, we did not get any information about our NEW tickets.  All they did was mention that we could bring a friend for free.  All that this did was add to the total number of disappointed attendees today.\n\nWe arrived and were very much surprised by a heretofore unmentioned charge for parking.  Not once was it referenced in any of the communications, or on the page for the event.  Ten additional dollars poorer, we then waited for thirty to forty five minutes, in the sun, while other attendees tried futilely to register their less than useless tracker bracelets.  The wait would still have been a long time, even if EVERYONE had pre-registered, because none of the pre-registration credentials were being recognized.  However, the wait was even LONGER because only fifty five to sixty percent of the kiosks were working, and only forty five to fifty of them working completely.\n\nWe were then treated to spending huge amounts of time standing and waiting.  The shortest wait, after the registration debacle, was twenty minutes before getting to the \""Interactive\"" area.  This consisted mostly of cheesy games (more at home at Castles and Coasters than a groundbreaking technological marvel) that had simply been reskinned with Marvel characters. But, most of the Marvel Experience was the waiting.  Waiting for the \""3-D\"" and the \""4-D\"" experiences.  Both of these were notable lacking in at least one advertised dimension. The 3-D Projection wasn't even working, so the glasses they handed us were handed right back.  This after a forty five to fifty minute wait.  The wait to go from the \""3-D\"" part to the \""4-D\"" ride was only twenty to twenty five minutes... But, also NO 3-D!!!\n\nSo we spent two and a half hours getting less than half of what we paid for.  The only thing this had in common with Marvel was the name, as well as the waiting that Marvels dedicated fans do.  But, at least that waiting pays off in dividends of great comics, movies and TV series.  The \""Marvel Experience\"" was the waiting but, it was only followed by profound disappointment.\n\nAlso, the staff couldn't have been more disorganized and I'll-informed if they were the voting public.\n\nThis event was an over-hyped, under-delivered, bad faith rip-off.  We will pursue this as far as we need to get resolution.  I can't get the time from my limited life back that was wasted this morning back from them but, they can sure as Hell give me back my money."
4898	0	a	The marvel experience was not marvelous at all.  It was indeed terrible, I must say.  I understand this is the second day it has been open but nothing was working well.  The lines were extremely long to get in and once inside there were lines for everything!!!  Picture disney lines and multiply that by 10 and then only to arrive to things that you can do at other places like the laser maze, or a climbing wall. The better things were not working well at all.  The wrist bands were lame and not functional, the 3d and 4d movies were not 3d at all.  The total experience was terrible and I ended up apologizing to my family from out of the country to have taken them there on their vacation.  My kids say they would only go back if they got paid.  As for me, they would for sure have to pay me a lot to go back.  I highly recommend putting all of the employees through the experience because many of them could not explain how it worked or what would be next, also, you need to manage the lines a lot better, and of course get the technology to work.  The idea is good but the execution is very poor. I also have requested a refund.  Do not waste your time.  This is more for kids than adults but even the kids did not like it.
4899	0	a	1 star is too much for this extremely disappointing experience. Do yourself a favor and save your money. Even if everything was working it was still not worth the time and especially not worth the cost. The Marvel Experience was a Marvel Rip Off!\n\nEverything was grossly overpriced. Just glad I only wasted 40 on the ticket and not the 200 for VIP experience.
4900	0	a	"I went with my family on the very first day at 10:30am. I read the other reviews and it seems like the proceeding days were worst than the day I went. From a distant the tent looks like Baymax laying on the floor. Haha. Surprisingly, parking on the dirt road was $10 (luckily we had cash on hand). \n\nWe tried to register our wrist bands which was a waste of time because the machines kept messing up due to the sunlight. As I scanned my band to participate in the activities, another person's information appeared instead of my own. Fail. \n\nThe most exciting part of the experience was the \""training\"" area. Since we went the first day, the lines weren't as long and all of the machines were functioning. They didn't function very well (Iron Man and Hulk training activity), but they still worked. The laser maze and rock wall were the best training activities, but I felt like I could have done the rock wall at a real rock climbing gym. \n\nOur mortal bodies grew weak. We needed sustenance! And everything was overpriced (as expected) and tasted worst than Subway. \n\nThe second part of the training dealt with learning about several villains such as Red Skull and Madame Hydra. It was kind of... Dumb. We couldn't really hear the interactive screens that gave brief infos about each villains because of the loud music and chattering going on around us. \n\nAs we proceeded into the 3D dome area, we pretty much strained our necks as we had to look up the whole time while the show was projected onto the ceiling. This made me pretty dizzy and caused a headache. \n\nI'm getting tired of writing this review... \n4D was 'aight. Again, it was neck straining and not fantastic.\nGift shop was similar to those overpriced gift shops at Disneyland. \nSave your time and money. Don't go. \nThe End."
4901	0	a	STAY AWAY! Save your money and get more Christmas presents for your family. I had purchased the 99.00 VIP pass. That pass basically got you 1) one time access anytime 2) free parking 3) access to front of the line 4) free t-shirt and poster 5) and access to the VIP lounge. Let's start by saying people must of read the reviews for this place because when my group went at 8pm last night ...no one was here. So, basically I spent 99.00 on parking, a t-shirt, and poster. How did I like the Marvel experience? It sucked. Entering the training room was like going to a Chuck E cheese with 1/2 the games not working. Then you would self guide yourself to another room where you watched a short animated cartoon. The last room...the 4D room...is a room set up theatre style where you sit and watch a cartoon and your seat shakes and you get an occasional gust of air blown on you. Now if you are 12 and under you would probably appreciate the Marvel Experience, but if you are a grown adult you would probably had wished you had spent your hard earned cash on a steak dinner with a bottle of wine for two.
4902	0	a	Let me start by telling you what they got right - the story is good and relies on comic book lore that goes a little deeper than the cinematic universe. There is one moment near the end that genuinely brought a smile to my face which I won't ruin for you, and the staff seemed like they genuinely wanted to help. However, none of that can make up for the complete disorganization and technical malfunction we experienced.\n\nI was part of the 10:00am Saturday group that others have written about. First, we spent 45 minutes trying to register our wristbands on malfunctioning kiosks, which was made especially painful by the fact that the wristbands didn't seem to work at all and that the registration served no purpose.\n\nWe moved through the first two domes in a long line but without any specific problems. When we got into the first experience dome, what others have referred to as the arcade dome, we began to see clearly that the experience was not ready for the public. We were told that the Iron Man flight simulator didn't work, only to see people using about an hour later with a long line. We waited 30 minutes to get into the laser shooting gallery, only to have it malfunction when we went inside, where they left us standing in the dark for 15 minutes before unceremoniously being told to leave. The only functioning exhibit we were able to experience was the reconstructing the adaptoid, which was ok but not anywhere near the entertainment we expected for the price of admission. By the time we left this room we we were already frustrated.\n\nWe then moved onto the vestibule for the next exhibit, where we waited for another 30 minutes for the next dome, where we were told 110 people were 'stuck'. When we finally moved inside, they passed out 3D glasses and we were told we would begin our training. Moments later, they told us to take off the glasses because the 3D wasn't working anyway. The 2D animated movie was ok, and might have been awesome in 3D but who knows. Most of the people I was with ceased being able to follow the story at this point anyway.\n\nThe next chamber in between training and the climax was good, and actually the best part of our experience, which I won't ruin for anyone. If the rest of the exhibit had worked as well I wouldn't be complaining.\n\nMost insulting was the '4D' ride at the end. They took our malfunctioning wrist bands before we entered, and throughout the presentation it became clear that we would have been participating if we had them. There were no '4D' effects beyond what you could get in a flight simulator at Dave and Busters. The movie was not in 3D.\n\nThe store at the end looked like it had some nice, unique merchandise, but we were so irritated and angry we just rushed through it and left, not interested in spending even one more dollar.\n\nI spent $215 dollars on 4 adult and 2 child's tickets and $10 for parking for an experience that left me sad, dissapointed, and angry. I had high hopes for this. I have since learned that some people have been offered refunds or passes to return when they have things working, but no one has reached out to us despite our attempts to contact them. The uneven reimbursement just adds insult to injury.\n\nUPDATE: I was contacted and offered a refund, which Ticketmaster processed right away, so kudos to the Marvel Experience and Hero Ventures for doing the right thing.
4903	0	a	Work out your glitches before you open. This is for kids. Arcade games are juvenile and not challenging. Unorganized. Long lines. The 3D movie crashed two minutes in AFTER they took back our glasses cause the 3D wasn't working. The motion ride was carnival quality at best. OVERPRICED!!! For what you get. Two hours of my life never get back. Not to mention the silly revolving doors between tents where the person behind me shoved the door into my heel. Like the other commenters, I was so angry by the time I got to the end. no way was I paying a ridicules price for our pictures. Save your blood pressure and money. Look elsewhere for fun.
4904	0	a	"Not worth the time, much less the price of admission.  The VIP package doesn't add anything of value.\nIt's a colorful game of waiting in line, dodging small children. The \""training simulations\"" aren't calibrated, so you can't play them without encountering more glitches than hits, making the 40 minute wait that much more bitter in hindsight. \nThe registration was broken, so we didn't get several of the features of the expensive package or any of the personalization that is supposed to be a feature of the whole Experience itself.\nThe opening scene had to be restarted several times because the audio and video didn't sync up.\nThe room transitions were poorly managed, with a bored looking person in a SHIELD t-shirt letting the music play a few loops before pressing the button to open the doors, making for a really engaging and immersive time, imagining you're in training for an actual government contract job, waiting for the instructor who is running behind due to a pile of paperwork and red tape.\n\nDon't waste your time, money, or sanity."
4905	0	a	"The Marvel Experience was REALLY an experience.  It was the worst experience that you could imagine!.  The lines were long, long, long.  After we waited in line to get in (only so many are allowed in at a time--makes sense to me) BUT and I mean BUT, there is NO time limit once you get in.  Hence, there are too many people in the Training area.   We waited 45 minutes in line to get into one of the Training games. (game lasted 3 or 4 minutes)   This \""experience\"" is being marketed as an Adult experience, but in reality it is for kids and at least 50% of the people there today at 11:30am were kids between the ages of 6 and 8.  There were too many other things that were wrong, but that would take up too much of my time.   If I could give a rating less than a One, I would.  Save your money, give it to charity, do anything else with it, but.......... Do not go !!!!!"
4906	0	a	"UTTER WASTE OF TIME and MONEY !\n\n$130 for family of four with parking and $4 for a bottle of water for.... waiting in line to get in to a tent where you AGAIN wait for in line to play second rate kinect games. Then you move on to the next tent where you AGAIN WAIT and WAIT to watch some trite Sunday morning cartoons.\n\nThe worst part of this is the way this is set up. THERE IS NO WAY TO LEAVE - you have to go through this gauntlet of boredom and tackiness to exit.  I seriously thought about using the emergency doors, no joke here. We couldn't wait for this NIGHTMARE to end. We couldn't get the hell out of there fast enough. \n\nWhoever came up with this, started with this question. How can I separate bunch of fools from their money while putting least amount of effort? I disagree with previous reviewers in that the poor experience was due to technical difficulties. The poor experience is due to fundamentally flawed design at every level. Almost everything there from plot of the story, cartoon design, organization, the attractions inside the tent, the 4D ride seems to be an afterthought. Something thrown together hastily and on the cheap. There were few set pieces that look nice... but that's not even worth the trip.\n\nWhat they excelled at was how to extract your cash. Starting with the overpriced tickets, parking, photo opportunities, way overpriced cafe and the classic exit through the gift shop. Now If your cash wasn't enough they also have you input personal information under guise of obtaining your \""agent\"" ID cards. Sadly you never get a physical ID and in retrospect this was just a way to gather your personal information  be resold for even bigger profit. It's just SICKENING. \n\nShame on Marvel. I actually enjoyed most of of their movies. Now every time I see Iron Man or Captain America I seriously cringe. I am definitely will not be seeing any more of the upcoming Marvel movies in the theatre or purchase any merchandise. It's a shame because Jon Favreau take on Iron Man really turned be on to the genre. On the opposite side of the spectrum we have projects such as Marvel experience - which completely turn me off from the Marvel franchise."
4907	0	a	"After sending an email via the Marvel Experience site, I received an email expressing apologies and offering return tickets or a refund.   \n\nIMO, the groups that experienced the severe tech difficulties, should have been approached by management before we left the \""experience\"".  That probably would have saved a lot of the negative reviews.\n\nFor the apologies and return/refund tickets, they get an additional star."
4908	0	a	Overall spent $300 for an experience that was hyped up to be the best experience.  At least that's wasn't what was shown on the advertisement my nephew saw.  That is the only reason we all wanted to go as a family.\n\nWhat did we really get?  RFID bracelet that didn't work. Why make us spend multiple time registering.  In the end, the games showed me up as some 8 yr old white kids.  \n\nThe Hulk game and Iron man game were not even sync or calibrated.  Whats the point of waiting in line to training and no be able to do anything except crash into the mountain or not even move the hulk.  You should invest in a XBOX.  At least they know how to get those game working\n\nThe only good game was the laser black widow game.  Too bad you only had 1 of them and it also had the longest line.  What were you thinking?\n\nThe 3D?  Really?  First of all, it didnt work or wasn't 3D to begin with.  Then we had to keep looking at the done.  Why not just tell us to lay down on the floor?  It would have been better than have to keep our neck in that uncomfortable position.\n\nThe 4D?  Great, still no 3D but now our seat gets some movement.  I guess it wasn't bad but from the look of the movie, i suspect our faces should have appeared on the screen to be part of the movie BUT since the RFID didn't work, we had some random people I didn't know.  I don't think a single person on the screen was in my party.\n\nIf you wanted us to test out the ride for people in the later day, I understand.  But you really shouldn't be charging for that since you didn't get your act together!  It should have been free or a greatly reduced price; not the same price as every one else. \n\nOh also you should have mention the $10 parking on the website.  Not all of us carry cash.  Lucky we had enough change in the car to cover this.  Even the sign directing us to the parking lot didn't mention $10 until we got to the gate.  Stupid poor planning!
4909	0	a	They should name the name from the Marvel Experience to the Awful Experience.  How can a company that makes such good movies associate with this rip off?  My kids were frightened.  I really need to look into this and see if anyone who runs this company has experience at this.  I heard Magic Johnson was involved?
4910	0	a	"The Marvel Experience has a lot of potential. The idea of playing the role of a recruit for SHIELD, training, and helping to defeat Hydra is awesome. However, the execution of this event was so disappointing that words can't even express it.\n\nIf you go, DO NOT buy VIP\nWe bought 2 regular VIP tickets for $100 and one Level 9 ticket for $180. The only difference between the regular VIP and Level 9 VIP was a small cheap spiderman action figure. THAT IS IT. Supposedly you get a custom figure from the gift shop, but none of the employees knew what it was so we didn't get it. The \""VIP Lounge\"" which we all had access to was a small crappy tent with 2 small couches, and the VIP food consisted of small cups of fruit, vegetables, and popcorn. Not what we expected for the price. The VIP bathroom they advertise is only next to the VIP lounge tent, so with the exception of the first 10 minutes you are there, you will be using the regular bathrooms with everyone else. \n\nNothing seems to work, not even the employees\nMost of the employees didn't seem to know what was going on. It took us almost an hour to even get access. Some employees were in character, calling you a recruit and acting as if it was all real, but most of them were apathetic and disinterested, and our VIP concierge was even texting on her phone. The wristbands you get at the beginning are supposed to be programmed with your information so that when you are in training, you scores can be recorded. BUT the machines that you use to register your information were broken when we were there, so our characters were just \""First Name Last Name\"". The training modules used Kinect to detect your movements, and often did not register when you were doing something. When I played the Iron Man game, it did not once register any of my movements. When I complained to one of the employees, she said it just doesn't read some people. Umm..Okay? Not what I wanted to hear after waiting in line for 30 minutes to play this game.\n\nIt just goes from bad to worse\nAfter you complete your training, you go to a dome-shaped tent to receive your mission. It is projected on the ceiling of the tent, and you are told to sit on the dirty carpeted floor to watch it. If this sucked for me, I'm sure this sucked for the older people there who brought their grandchildren. The transitions between each experience thereafter are unnecessarily long and you will find that you spend a large portion of your time just standing and waiting. Keep in mind, this is after the 2.5 hours you spent in the training room, waiting for 30 minutes at a time in line for each activity. When you do finally get to the final chamber where you, one of the recruits, are needed to save the day, you are asked to lift your arm band to save the day, only to realize they took your armband. You will then go to the giftshop where you see more employees in this one room than you saw in the entire event, and they follow you as you walk around the giftshop to make sure you aren't stealing anything. Stealing from them? I feel like they stole from me! I want my $380 back!\n\nThe moral of the story\nBe a real superhero. Save your money, save your time, save your sanity. Don't go."
4911	0	a	"So all of the things I posted about and feared...came true! Big surprise! So where can I get our refund? We had to pay 10$ MORE to get NEW tickets so we'd be secured a spot. Thank god we did because the lines for those who were told to come at \""any time\"" were atrocious. Poor kids waiting in the sun...EXACTLY what I feared. The ride was not in 3D and was short. A lot of props were very cheap and plastic they looked super fake. Legacy Effects should have been hired to do the props. It was laughable actually. A lot of things were not working and it was supposed to be geared towards adults....uhm, no...this was definitely for little kids. Even the marvel section at Universal (before being bought by Disney) was a way better experience. As someone with a low income, this was incredibly expensive and disappointing. The wrist bands tracked us for what purpose? They took them away before the MAIN RIDE?! So now you have all of my information and for what? Leave the production to Disney, Legacy or Stan Winston for a GOOD experience. Very poorly executed. Oh and we found some of the busts and frames they were selling for 75% cheaper at HOBBY LOBBY the DAY of the event! LOL. Give me a refund. Total bait and switch."
4912	0	a	"I really wish I could have my money back. And I'm kind of embarrassed that this was a gift activity too.  I'm writing this review actually, as I stand in a Disney-length of line to partake in a simple and probably overrated video game activity. Pretty sure the website hyped this up much more than needed. The \""times of entry\"" that you purchase tickets for, are overcrowded, for one... And for the first 45 mins you are here, nothing is happening.\n\nThere is a ratio of 5:1 kids to adults. The age of these kids!? 3-6 years old. The rules and FAQs do specifically state that this experience is for older kids and adults. And sure enough... A kid is crying next to me while the mother yells at the poor staff member because her kid is too small and unable to activate the video sensors. \n\nFor the price of $30 per person, and then paying $10 for parking... You too can enjoy crowded rooms full of snot nose kids, screaming parents, long lines to pathetic \""experiences\"" and a marvel themed caf\u00e9!!! \n\n... A kid just threw himself on the floor in crying hysterics next to me"
4913	0	a	Interactive video games that don't work well and some surround screen video that wasn't well done.  Not worth the time and definitely not the price
4914	0	a	"Not worth the time, much less the price of admission.  The VIP package doesn't add anything of value.\nIt's a colorful game of waiting in line, dodging small children. The \""training simulations\"" aren't calibrated, so you can't play them without encountering more glitches than hits, making the 40 minute wait that much more bitter in hindsight. \nThe registration was broken, so we didn't get several of the features of the expensive package or any of the personalization that is supposed to be a feature of the whole Experience itself.\nThe opening scene had to be restarted several times because the audio and video didn't sync up.\nThe room transitions were poorly managed, with a bored looking person in a SHIELD t-shirt letting the music play a few loops before pressing the button to open the doors, making for a really engaging and immersive time, imagining you're in training for an actual government contract job, waiting for the instructor who is running behind due to a pile of paperwork and red tape.\n\nDon't waste your time, money, or sanity.\n\nEdit:\nCalled ticketmaster several times and eventually they authorized a refund.\nCan't increase the rating in good conscience as I still don't think the show is worthwhile or well put together.  Maybe with its next incarnation it can become something I'd enjoy and recommend."

4916	0	a	"I never complain but this was awful. I felt sorry for the girl putting on the bracelets. She was having a hard time. The kiosks were down so couldn't even activate them.  Then we go wait in a line. They let 120 in at a time. So after 20 mins or so waiting there we got in. Look it's Iron Man's mask. Why does it look like a plastic toy?  All of the \""movie props\"" looked like cheap plastic. I went to the little marvel area at Disney and everything looked real. Here it looked cheap. Then came the lines. I waited in the wall crawl line with the kids while my wife waited in the 3D shoot em up line. We were able to do both after over an hour. So we had been in line for about 1 1/2 hours overall and got to do two things that took a couple mins each. Maybe 5 mins at the shoot em up. The kids were bored so we went to the next area. We got to see a video on one dome and the \""4D\"" motion ride. Those were decent but not worth the $120 we paid for tickets. When I asked the kids what was the best part, it was eating at YC's afterwards. As a fan boy I am totally disappointed by this. If I could give it negative stars I would."
4917	0	a	"Long lines. Only 2 of the training room events worked. I waited 5 hours in line, and only got at most an hour of \""experience\"" out of it. The staff was extremely friendly, but did not keep any order in the areas. VIP cut off everyone for everything at anytime. No separate line. No real explanation. Nothing. I came into this super excited and left with $40 for a terrible event. Plus $10 extra for parking in a dirt lot next to the event. Do not waste your money on this."
4918	0	a	"Not worth the money at all. Long lines. Disorganized. I could play these \""games\"" at home for a fraction of the cost. Obvious cash grab and a waste of time. \""The Money Extortion\"""
4919	0	a	I was disappointed when our check in time was for 11:30am and we didn't even get in until almost 12:30pm.  Then not only did we wait an hour to get in, there is long lines everywhere.  We waited at least an hour to do a 5-6 minute 3D game and then the lines were too long to do the other training so we just went on to the 3D movie and then that pushed us right into the 4D movie.  So we were there from 11:30am - 2:30pm and did 3 (5-10 minutes each) things.  Very disappointed.  A small churro was $5 so even to feed my kids a small snack would have been $25.  Very interesting idea and we would have enjoyed it more but my kids actually had more fun at Peter Piper Pizza after the Marvel Experience.  That's all they have talked about was playing games.  Never mentioned the Marvel Experience once to their friends. \nThey were not prepared for such a large number of people.  I figured having a check in time would help eliminate the crowd but it was a waste of our time.
4920	0	a	"I am only giving this one star because it is not possible to give it zero.  I was so very excited to bring my son to this. We had been eagerly anticipating this event.....I don't  even have words to express how disappointed I am.  I  genuinely feel robbed.  Robbed of my hard earned money.  Robbed of my precious valuable time.  And robbed of my sanity as I stood in Dinseyland long lines to play overrated arcade games the DIDN'T work.  I believe the website and \""Blogs\"" are guilty of false advertising.  I wouldn't waste my time if this event was free.  I hope I can find a way to get my money back.  I would also like to note that I have never written a review before in my life.  I decided to sign up with a Yelp account in hopes to save someone else from the major disappointment I just experienced."
4921	0	a	DO. NOT. WASTE. YOUR. MONEY.\n\nI know what you're thinking: How bad could this be? No way Marvel would endorse something that isn't 100% awesome. This must be a guy who went on the first day when they had glitches, it has to have gotten so much better since then. \n\nDon't do it. Marvel really duped us on this one. There are two decent activities to participate in (a shooting game and a maze) but both require a full hour wait and last only a few minutes at best. The rest of the area has very little interactivity. I went several days after the opening night and everything was working, nothing was out of service. Despite that, my kids (7 and 9) were bored the entire night. \n\nThe 3D/4D graphic shows were cool, but they were very brief and not at all worth the $150 we paid for a family of 5. I'd love to have time travel as a super power so I could go back and tell myself not to waste the money or the time. Hopefully, you don't make the same mistake.
4922	0	a	OMG do not, I repeat DO NOT waste your money!\nIt was literally a walk thru museum.... Couple 5 min 3D simulations but nothing more than the vibrating chair at bed bath and beyond.
4923	0	a	"Yelp limits you to 5001 CHARACTERS in your reviews--which simply is not enough for things like \""experiences.\""  That said I have posted a full review here on our blog at https://gerouxcrew.wordpress.com/2014/12/29/our-experience-at-marvel-experience/  for all to see complete with pictures if you would like more details about my comments below\n\nDisclaimer:\nIt should be noted that I refrained from reading any reviews or watching any news stories about this event prior to our visit so I kept my own expectations as high as they should have been for the cost of the tickets.  Also, while some may say it is not fair to compare something like this to \""Disneyland\"", I disagree.  Disney as the parent company who has \""theme park\"" entertainment down to a science would never settle for the poorly executed design and management of this experience to exist.  No reason to re-invent the wheel- pool resources from the Disney parks gurus and fix the kinks.  Several of the activities inside the experience are actual activities AT Disneyland (in the Innoventions attraction in Tomorrowland) so there should be zero \""kinks\"" with those, yet there are.\n\nCost: For our family of 4 (2 adults 2 teens) we paid $145 for the Marvel Experience plus an additional $10 for parking and shelled out another $20 for a souvenir photo.  So at $175 we are not talking about chump change.\n\nTime: We had tickets for Sunday December 28th at 3pm- the web said the experience would last 90-120 minutes. We were there for 3.5 hours ( i.e. 210 minutes) from 2:45pm until 6:15pm.  Approximately 60 minutes of that was actual \""experience\"" everything else was standing in line.\n\nWould we do it again?:\nnot likely- at least not at the cost that it was.  Again it was nearly $30 per person\n\nPros:  It's Marvel so if you like Marvel you will be able to find something to like about it.\n\nCons: 1-interestingly enough kids 6 and under were FREE- which blows my mind because there sure were a TON of them and they take up a TON of time on the activities that those of us that PAID to be there are now having to wait for.  Due to the structure of the activities I believe every person who enters should be a paying ticket holder that would make it fair. 2- parking was an additional $10 (if you ever go to anything at Talking Stick you KNOW you have to pay for parking, this just always sucks- but at $10 per event they need to PAVE that lot- the dirt is getting old) 3- poor crowd management (read full review for details) 4- low value high cost (see full review for details of what $30 per person gets you)"
4924	1	a	I went with a group of friends and we had a lot of fun. I enjoyed all the things I could do, especially the laser maze, the 3-d shooting and the motion-effects theatre. I would compare this more to an interactive museum experience rather than a disneyland-esque experience, so just go with that frame of mind when going.
4925	0	a	"I know what The Marvel Experience feels like whenever I've gone and seen a Marvel movie. Fun, excitement, laughter. All joyous emotions. I felt none of that during this experience. This was just flat out horrible on many levels. \n\nI avoided the dreaded $10 parking fee that others encountered. When I went with a buddy of mine Sunday night it was pretty dead. Guess the bad word of mouth had made it thru by then. \n\nThe staff was just so blah. No excitement or enthusiasm of any kind. But I will say that it was at night so maybe they are just tired from repeating the same stuff over and over.\n\nThe \""interactive\"" stuff isn't much. It felt very cheap and that they were thinking. Let's just slap the name Marvel on it and people will love it. The Spider-man wall climb was just a regular rock climbing wall that moved. Would it have killed them to make a rock climbing wall that looked like the side of a high rise building? Or something like a magnet or velcro suit that let's u stick to walls? Dome 1 mostly consisted of monitors that had the origins of the characters which were all covered many times before in Marvel movies and cartoons. And the noise level of the dome drowned out the sound of the televisions, so you couldn't hear anything anyways. The \""museum\"" was a joke. I was thinking it was a hall of Marvel history with props from some of the actual movies. All the props looked like plastic toys you could get a any toy store. Most of the games didn't work right. The holo simulator was ok, but it felt cheap. As far as computer animation has come along the graphics for the heroes in dome 1 was very lackluster. \n\nThe Quinjet that was advertised so much as a life size one that you wouldn't believe it was all one piece. Was just pretty much a wing. There was no cockpit or seats or anything like that. Just more monitors telling you about the origins of the villains.\n\nThey took away our initial bracelets when we reached Dome 2 and I for one have no idea why they gave them to us to begin with. Cause they told us when we first walked in that those bracelets they gave us didn't work. It just made no sense at all. The 3d movie was cool but it ends right when it starts getting good with no conclusion and the staff ushers you right into the next room. The 4d ride was fun for what it was. But again without those bracelets working the part where they want you to interact falls flat. \n\nThe gift shop was full of overpriced items and not many things to choose from.  It consisted of a certain amount of items just spaced out in different parts of the gift shop. \n\nAll in all for $37 its a major ripoff. I would feel like a straight idiot if I paid for the VIP package. The games are the same type of games you would find in a Peter Piper. You would think they would have people dressed up in character costumes walking around the place for photo ops. And it basically focus on The Avengers. If its a true Marvel experience where were all the hundreds of characters that they have in their library?\n \nIf your a 5 year old kid. This place is a blast. I got excited when I first pulled up to the place and I saw those huge domes all glowing and the music blaring. But if your a true Marvel fan thinking your going to go into the mecca of the world of Marvel universe. You'll come out very very VERY disappointed."
4926	0	a	Waited 1.45 hour for a 5 min shooting game and another hour to spend 1 min. walking through laser beams. Two of the attractions were broken and the wristband to track your points and keep the groups moving through were also broken.
4927	0	a	Huge disappointment. Gave it so many chances and excuses for it not to suck. But I'm the end it just flat out sucked. Not worth the 30 dollars if you're over the age of 12. I will stick to the Marvel comics/movies. We also noticed(while standing in an hour line for something that didn't work) was the interactive animations were full of lag and looked as someone set up a Xbox 360 kinect to use.
4928	0	a	Not much else to say that others haven't.  13 YO kid as well as 2 adults; all were bored.  Don't compare lines to Disney because there at least there is a pay-off at the end.  We waited almost an hour for a shooting gallery we could play on XBox. UGH.  Why is the 4D experience not in 3D???
4929	0	a	Do not waste your money or time.\n\nThe wait times were 30-45 minutes for each event, the technology was old, and nothing seemed to work. I was given a wrist band for no reason. The motion seats were nice, but the 10 minute 4D experience movie should have been in 3D.
4930	0	a	Got the VIP packages and that was now way worth the additional 100 plus for this experience. If your lucky once inside you can find a staff member with a red hat who is supposed to be your concierge to get to the head of the line. Well that only works on entry and one interactive exhibit. You stand in line for everything else. The VIP tent is tiny with $7 drinks and your VIP T shirt. NOT even close to being worth it. You do however save the $10 parking fee, whoohoo , it's a dust bowl dirt lot. Overall the group running it mentioned several things were not right, like the screen printed poster not being available (part of VIP), the 3D not working on something's , and the RFID wrist band, what's with that? It didn't do anything.  Overall the $25 ticket might be okay, but not the VIP.
4931	0	a	"I agree with others that this would have been more entertaining and fun if I were younger. \n\nI knew there would be many children, so I went in with that expectation. In reality, the adults and teenagers were much harder to deal with. Two forty-something year old women stood in line behind my boyfriend and me and they shouted as if they were at a concert. They would not shut up about every little thing they observed and kept butting into other people's conversations. Long story short...these kinds of events attract idiots and people of all walks of life. So brace yourself for an airport-like experience.\n\nThe entire event was rather boring and full of long lines. It focused on the Avengers characters; but for political correctness, they threw in the Black Panther and the \""strong woman type\"" She-Hulk. \n\nNone of the registration kiosks were open. So it seems they never fixed their IT issues. The technology is a bit dated, and to be honest a lot of the interactive games were of same quality as DisneyQuest in Chicago (closed since 2001). Seeing the Cox logo on a screen was in bad taste. I'm surprised I didn't see more sponsorship logos around. \n\nIt's not worth the drive, headache, or money to go. I would rather drive to Universal Studios Florida from AZ and stand in their lines for some decent thrill rides than this load of crap."
4932	0	a	As you can see from the reviews, The Marvel Experience sucked.  \n\nWhat are you going to do about it?\n\nThis whole fiasco was put on by a group called Hero Ventures entrusted by Disney with the Marvel brand and they are taking a big steaming dump all over it.  Disney, as caretaker of the Marvel brand, has dropped the ball. As a lifelong Marvel fan, I'm pretty pissed.\n\nIf you feel the same way, let Disney know: http://thewaltdisneycompany.com/contact-us
4933	0	a	The Marvel Experience, more like I took your money and there is nothing you can do. Do not go, 4-D will never happen. You will never be immersed in the 3-D and 4-D. \n\nThe Marvel website promised a lot, LOL. If you go do not expect a lot. Don't expect anything except long lines.
4934	0	a	"I was looking forward to this event in Scottsdale as it was one of the few times my fiance and I could get away from work to do something together. Unfortunately the day was far from pleasant. It began by not going in at our scheduled time, but over an hour later. We tried to relax with soda and water as the sun beat down on us, only to find the concession stand had only room temperature drinks! We were also unable to register our wrist bands which made the experience not quite as immersive during the \""training\"" as I felt like I saw just \""First Player\"". There were long lines for each activity and game, and the staff didn't seem to care much about it instead goofing with their phones, ignoring my questions, and talking with other employees about non work related activities. And the games and activities did not work or respond well at all. We finally gave up to go in to more hurry up and wait lines to see the 3D dome. the sound was so muffled we couldn't understand half the dialogue.  Then came more hurry up and wait while we waited for the ride. The ride itself wasn't bad though and unfortunately the only thing that went well. Even the gift shop area seemed poorly managed by employees that were more interested in talking to girls that were obviously much younger than them and \""checking them out.\""\n\nI felt as if I wasted my ticket money and spent it for overpriced warm drinks, poor staffing, and standing in line for 4 hours of my day. So glad I didn't opt for VIP"
4935	0	a	"Don't. Just don't. Every horrible thing people have said on here is 100% true. I read reviews before going but kept thinking that it couldn't really be that bad. Trust me, it is. I'm not technologically advanced as far as 3D and 4D so I was sure that those things would interest me and seem cool. Wrong. It was sooooo bad. Let me lay out my complaints for you, one by one.\n\n1)We went on 12/30 at 11:30 am. It was hot in the main dome. Uncomfortably so. This is AZ people. Even in the winter, the sun shines. Have adequate a/c and ventilation ready.\n\n2)The lines. For heaven's sake, the lines. I've stood in shorter lines at Disneyland. Not too mention after you stand in each line the game lasts no more than a minute. So I just stood there for 45 minutes to be entertained for 60 seconds.\n\n3)Broken stuff. The registration booths were broken but they still gave you these stupid bracelets to wear. They did absolutely nothing. Nothing. Try to explain that to a 5 year old who wanted to scan his bracelet at every game or exhibit we went to. Also that day one of Spiderman's climbing \""walls\"" (these were a freaking joke) were down as was some of the Ironman games.\n\n4)The expense. I took my 5 year old so he was free. Which was good because if he wasn't I would have been asking for my money back. Everything inside was overpriced, just like the ticket itself. They had a souvenir popcorn bucket for $10. You'd think for that price it would be something cool, printed with characters and stuff on it. No. It was a white bucket that said The Marvel Experience in black. That's it. \n\n6)The 3D/4D portion. Both the movie and ride were ridiculous. For the movie you had to stand in this dome and crane your neck up to watch it on the ceiling. You weren't allowed to sit and watch this. No, that would make too much sense. Same for the ride except you were sitting in a vibrating chair for that one. It was still uncomfortably high on the ceiling. And you can only ride the ride once. This should be said with a huge disclaimer before you buy the tickets. Sure, it was kind of lame but if I had been able to ride it more than once it might have lessened the blow. \n\nOverall my 5 year old loved it. I can't imagine anyone over the age of 5 loving it though. He thought the ride was cool. It's just too bad we could only ride it once. If it came back next year I definitely wouldn't take him unless the prices the went down and everything else went up."
4936	0	a	Just wanted to write a review to chip in with what the others said. I would not recommend going.  If you have little kids (under 8 maybe), they might like it but unless you have a lot of money to waste it probably wouldn't be worth finding out. A lot of the attractions are not very accurate. There's one where you strike a pose and you summon a superhero based on your pose. 8 out of 10 people would change their pose and summon the same superhero. Also, there's nowhere to sit. You wait in line after line and nowhere to sit. By the end, we were excited for the sitting ride. That actually was a cool part; really, the only cool part. Yeah, just thinking about it now depresses me a bit. I would gladly have the memories erased from my brain if I could have the money back.
4937	0	a	Ripoff is the only to accurately describe my experience.   To further explain the price was too high for what you got in return which was overcrowding to the point inhibiting participation.  The experience could all be had on wii and a local gym.
4938	0	a	I was ready to be a SHIELD recruit. But recruits are relegated to being INACTION figures standing in long lines forever for 2 lame rides. 4D just means you're entering a Dollar-Deducting Disappointment Dome. Run for your lives! Keep your $34/person in your wallet. Parking is an extra $10. The most fun we had was laughing while reading bad-funny Yelp reviews about The Marvel Experience during the endless wait for Nothing Much. Thank God our tickets were comped. Kill me now.\n\nTo be totally fair, I should add that the people working this event in Scottsdale were beyond nice and pleasant. We're talking Disney level niceness. The staff was great.
4939	0	a	Save time and money with the Marvel Home Experience... here's how in 7 easy steps!\n\n1.  Stand in a corner for an hour.\n\n2.  Setup your favorite light gun game... I like Duck Hunt.  Stand approximately 20 feet away from the light gun for an 1 hour.\n\n3.  Play the light gun game for 5 minutes.\n\n4.  Walk around your house for 30 minutes trying to decide on a thing that you don't want to wait for the next hour to do. \n\n5.  strap a lcd monitor to your ceiling, and put in an animated Marvel movie.  Anyone will do it doesn't really matter.  Watch that movie for 10 minutes or until your neck gets too sore to continue... whichever comes first.\n\n6.  Sit in a chair and continue to watch that movie while rocking back and forth.  Spray some compressed air in your face 4 - 5 times. \n\n7.  Go online to Skymall.com and look at overpriced crap.  Don't buy anything.\n\nThere you have it.  All the fun of the Marvel Experience in your own home. \n\nSeriously, all the bad reviews on Yelp are fairly accurate.  Really long lines, lackluster events, promised experiences that are often broken.  All leading to the ridiculously overpriced gift shop.  I regret every minute I spent there today.  Hopefully the people in the next town this traveling circus goes to next read Yelp before buying tickets.
4940	0	a	"What a freakin scam!!!!   I have not been this let down in awhile.  Ok so the web site promoted this amazing 3 and 4 dimensional experience, and I went to see the state of simulation technology. \n\nI should have known it wasn't going to be good when Robert Downey Jr. was not Tony Stark in the intro cartoon while you waited in line to be let in.  It only got worse from there.\n\nIt begins in the \""main dome\"" which I expected to be an interactive dream...  What I got was a bunch of displays of plastic that didn't do anything, a line to play a shooter game that would be better on the wii, which then proceeded to a five minute dome movie that was a cartoon, and a three minute simulation ride, where the seat moved, again with a cartoon.    And that was it...   no amazing interaction with the marvel characters, no four dimensional holograms that brought you into the action, no 360 degree movie experience to make you feel like you were there...  In short, Disney made \""circle vision\"" in the 60's and it was WAY BETTER than anything I saw in my 2 hours in this cheap scam to sell marvel apparel.\n\nIf you had a kid, who was 6, MAYBE they would enjoy it...   MAYBE.\n\nDo not waste your money...   Go go karting instead, there is a place right around the corner..."
4941	0	a	I jumped on to write a review, and sadly looks like I'll just be echoing a lot of bad reviews.  \n\nDespite my poor review, My 5 year old had a great time.  We got there right at opening, and had purchased a VIP ticket.  DO NOT buy the VIP ticket.  It did not do anything for us once inside.  It only lets you get in to a shorter line once or twice.  We waited in plenty of lines.  \n\nVIP lounge had great staff, but was not worth the time.  Lounge food was mostly communal bowls of chips, and pretzel mix etc, during flu season.  I was a bit grossed out.  Not even a complimenatry soft drink available.  Just water.  You could buy soda and beer at ball game prices.\n\nPositives: The Staff was incredible.  Really great people wanting to help you have a good time, many in character, with great attitudes.  I bet they heard a lot of complaints which is unfortunate as we liked every person we met.  \n\nThe technology worked for us throughout the event, and was very cool.  Bracelets were waste of time.  They should eliminate this aspect.\n\nIt's the lines that ruin the event.  As everyone has been repeating, the 30 minutes to an hour in line for a just ok activity is a massive let down.      \n\nI would give this event a thumbs down, and the VIP Pass a double thumbs down.\n\nIf they reduce the number of folks, it may improve the event.
4942	0	a	Let me add to the other reviews that mention the endless lines, malfunctioning exhibits, poorly trained staff, ridiculous refreshment prices, unadvertised parking fees and no warning that purses and strollers are not allowed inside. We were there on the infamous first Saturday, however, and I understand that there may be early glitches, and other excuses for Marvel to have robbed us of $100+. \n\nHere's another reason they suck: my husband was injured in one of the only experiences that was functional that day. I will fully admit that it was his fault, thinking he could be more flexible than his frame allows. The security and EMT staff were very kind and prompt. The husband ended up in the ER, but fortunately his injuries were not too serious. However, what appalls me is that they did not follow up with a phone call to either me or my husband when several staff members emphatically said they would, in order to make sure he was ok. I guess they were just relieved that we have insurance and are not litigious.
4943	0	a	We had photos taken at The Marvel Experience, but the paper stating the website where the photos are located got lost. We have tried contacting corporate to no avail. Does anyone happen to know the website URL? I will update my review and rating once someone contacts me back.
4944	0	a	"NOT WORTH IT FOLKS! Not enough words to convey about my experience but here goes. \nAfter reading all the hype, decided to take a chance and spend $30/ticket. I am a  fairly new Marvel fan and went with someone who is a [middle-aged] Marvel fan. The VIP tickets might have been a better bet IF I could have afforded them (about $100/ticket).  The \""hyper reality\"" is just HYPE. Poorly executed event, to say the least. The lines were incredibly long and once you got to do or see something, it only lasted a couple minutes. We only got to do three things in our 3 hours there! We stood in line for one 3D event for over an hour and the even took just 2 minutes. In our experience, there were numerous equipment malfunctions and glitches, so many kinks have to be worked out yet. We went on 12/30 so assumed any issues would have been fixed by then, but nope! The staff was poorly trained and at times, many of them did not seem to have any management or guidance around. A couple staff members completely ignored us when we asked questions, and others simply did not know or seem to care. \nOH and let me mention the $10 parking fee that they don't bother to tell you until you show up. Sadly we did not have cash on us and ended up being late to the ticket start time. Not a big deal in the end because at our 5pm start time we stood in line and waited for almost 20 minutes before being let in.\nAt the end of the event you get a free cheap plastic bracelet for completing and passing the Shield training and becoming a Shield recruit, whatEVER. Also at the end is a souvenir store where you can pay for overpriced this and that. Walk right on out folks.\nThis was a partial Christmas gift to someone I care about. I think it's safe to say we both felt let down. The hype says this event is geared to older kids and adults, however, it was clearly set up for younger kids, and kids under 6 were apparently free. Really young kids were the only one who seemed to enjoy it. And of course, food and beverage prices were astronomical. So overall, I would recommend foregoing this experience and save your money for something else. The people who put this on should be utterly ashamed of themselves. It was awful."
4945	0	a	This event was horrible. Lines, lines, lines. Has anyone been successful in getting their money back?? Ticketmaster won't budge.
4946	1	a	So, I was reluctant to see this but my wife dragged me to it. Surprisingly, I thoroughly enjoyed myself. The four singers did a great job and did justice to Sir Elton John, Barry Manilow, and billy Joel. A nice clean respectful show.
4947	1	a	I had never been to a Dutch Brothers before but one just opened up near my house and upon my daughters insistence we went. Best service I think I have ever had!  Not only was one person friendly but everyone was super friendly. I have never had an experience like that at any food/drink establishment!  And of course the drinks were delicious! ! Good job Dutch Bros on hiring great young people!
4948	0	a	My box of loaded fries came with a surprise: A DEAD FRIED COCKROACH!!!!! Luckily the incompetent employee forgot to put fork in my bag so I had to pick cheesy fries by hand and that allowed me to notice the bug!!! Big one too.
4949	0	a	The fucking employees are incompetent stop hiring highschool dropouts. When we got back the order was wrong the fries were cold, was so exited when they recently opened, with the shitty service and even shittier food i hope the shut this place down
4950	0	a	It's just sad, to be so excited to finally see a checkers and them to be so shitty. I ordered a big chicken club they assured me they had the right order and it wasn't. ..when I called to see if i could get some kind of something back for my wrong meal and super cold food they pretty much told me go fuck myself. Don't waste your time here cause the bad customers service and horribly cold food will just piss you off. Smh hopefully the right person see this and I can get back my 26$ we spent for something I would not eat in a zombie apocalypse.
4951	0	a	Oh god it was terrible! The employees were annoyed with the customers and even made fun of the guy in front of me. When I got my food there was a roach or cricket leg in it. Seriously. I'll starve before I eat here.
4952	0	a	As you walk in the order Kiosks are too close to the door and you walk right into people trying to order or people are walking into you as you order, bit akward, I don't suggest using them. The food was somewhat bland and a little overpriced for the quantity you get. There was fast and friendly service and the place was very clean. If you are hungry and you love to eat be prepared to drop a lot of cash!
4953	1	a	Quite a selection of donuts. Even had cronuts. The price for a dozen was around 10.00.\nThe donuts were fresh and delicious. The ladies behind the counter were kind and swift. \nI like the fact that they open at 5AM, I can then pick up a dozen for my office.
4954	1	a	I am not much of a doughnut person anymore but this place could convert me.  I stopped here because of Michael U's glowing review because I know what high standards he has.\n\nI got two fritters--an apple and a blueberry--and one croissant doughnut, a.k.a., cronut, that was raspberry filled.  The fritters were both quite good and while one was bought for my wife, she only got a small taste of it.  I had it gone in a flash.\n\nShe didn't care for the raspberry cronut thinking it was too sweet.  I soon dispatched the rest of that so she didn't have to suffer.\n\nBefore sundown, all three were gone even though I promised myself I'd save something for the next day,
4955	0	a	It's not terrible. Sushi menu is definitely limited. Did not try the hibachi only the sushi which was just ok. Not bad and not good. Probably wouldn't go back voluntarily. Some of their food is out of the box frozen like the crab Rangoon instead of made to order. I asked the waitress and she told me it was frozen.  The ginger salad was terrible because the ginger sauce was bad. Salad lettuce was browning. If you have options, I say pass.
4956	1	a	Nice atmosphere. I expected this to be more of a takeout place, but it is definitely more of an eat-in experience. We ordered  a Hibachi chicken meal, and some sushi rolls (Alaska and Tuna) The hibachi came with a salad, soup and choice of several sides. The salads came out, and almost immediately the soup and our main courses were brought to the table. The timing could use some improvement. The sushi was very good and the texture was better than most local places. We will definitely be back!
4957	1	a	I have been to the other Monks locations so I was excited when I heard they were coming Sun Prairie.  I was not disappointed.  We each orded something different and shared. I really liked my chicken sandwich and the fish tacos were great. My husband had a breakfast burger that while not something I would normally order, was pretty good.\n\nThere really aren't many places in Sun Prairie to eat besides fast food and I can see Monks being one of our favorites. I took away a star because the dining room is packed with tables,  when full it is a tight squeeze to get around.
4958	1	a	Great hospitality, great service, great food!  And they're open 23/7!
4959	1	a	Great service and amazing food. The meatball sliders are bond and the truffle Mac and cheese is something you will crave. This place is open 24hrs. Awesome place for late night food and drinks
4960	1	a	This place was recommended by the O'Sheas bartender. Excellent lunch. So good we went back for dinner. Calamari was the best EVER!!!!! Highly recommend!!!
4961	1	a	Forget about other nearby locations for breakfast. This is the place.  Delicious Belgian Waffles, Smoked Salmon plate and the most beautifully cooked poached eggs I've ever eaten. Service outstanding from everyone here.  Good ambiance.  Been here twice for breakfast.  Will definitely  be back to try lunch and dinner.
4962	1	a	For a place that's barely been open two weeks, this place is destined to be a hit. With an eclectic bistro menu downstairs and traditional chop house upstairs it has something for everyone. I had the grilled Mahi with quinoa, but also had tastes of the stroganoff made with fillet, the chicken parm and the gyro cheesesteak. It was all amazing. With some of Caesar's Palace's and Las Vegas' top restauranteurs, this place has all the makings of a home run. The    level of detail in the decor, food quality and bar offerings really is like no place I have ever been.
4963	1	a	The food is excellent and the service is great. Very homey and warm environment. The beef stroganoff is the best! Cheesecake is a must as well. Will go back again!
4964	1	a	Stumbled upon this place while walking around Caesars palace. I'm obsessed with the earl of sandwich inside planet hollywood (literally go there every time I'm in vegas) so I was pleasantly surprised to find a new location! \n\nThis branch is inside a mini food court next to smash burger, a ramen place, starbucks and a seafood restaurant so there's plenty of seating and different food options of someone in your party isn't craving a sandwich. \n\nYou can't go wrong with the full montague or chipotle chicken sandwich, but every sandwich I've tried is good. The bread is crunchy and soft and the ingredients are of good quality. Eat a sandwich there, take one to go.. Yum!
4965	0	a	Good food (small portions), Horrible Service\n\nI suppose any new restaurant has to work our wrinkles, and this place has a lot of wrinkles to work out.  While the food is good, the portions are smaller than similar restaurants.  That said, the service is horrible here, even by Chinese restaurant standards.  I felt like I was back in China w the rude servers and lack of hospitality.  I suppose I will come back again to see if the service improves after being open for awhile, but for now, this place is a fail.
4966	0	a	Waitress dropped a pair of scissors on the ground, wiped it on the towel and proceeded to cut the food. Nothing is outstanding here. Much better when it was Cathay house restaurant. The turnip cakes and taro balls were extremely salty. Egg tart is not bad along with the tripe. Siu Mai, shrimp balls, and banh cuon were hit and miss. Service was below average. Neglected our table a lot and we had to verbally call them over. Chrysanthemum tea.
4967	1	a	This used be Cathy House. . Now The Jade. . It is an improvement. . Dim sum is way better.  Prices are still to be determined.  They need to quickly get rid of the Nasty carpet and remodel the bathrooms. . They are busy and could use some help with getting the dim sum carts around more quickly. . Over good place.
4968	1	a	I just started coming to Puzzles after following my colorist Jenna from another salon. I love it! The studio is set inside Hair Personality and it has a wonderful cozy vibe decorated with art from local artists. Each time I've been offered a glass of wine or other refreshment. Jenna and Samuel are wonderful and I would definitely recommend this place. The color and cuts have been fabulous thus far!
4969	0	a	Pizza is great but service is crap. waited 10-15 min with 4 ppl in front of me to order a slice! of pizza then another 10-15 to get it. then u have to go search for water and napkins in the food park. not to mention trying to find a place to sit and eat the 7 yes 7 dollar slice of just peperoni pizza. no common sense is practiced here.
4970	1	a	Hard choosing a place to eat when you're on the strip with young kids. You can't go wrong with pizza (though not my personal first choice.) Was walking through Caesars and saw DiFara. Ordered a whole meat pizza for the family. Honestly the BEST food court or restaurant quality pizza I've tasted. Worth a try whether you are looking for something fast or just plain delicious pizza!
4971	1	a	Woooo!!!! Love this place!!! Missed ir soooo much. Havent had it in years. Since i moved to Vegas. Best fastfood FRIES!!!!!! Hands down
4972	0	a	Don't go here.  I know you might want to try it but these good reviews are people who sadly have no taste buds. I got fries a burger and the spicy chicken. The spicy chicken which I am almost positive they drive down the street got it from McDonald's re wrapped it and gave it to me for 50 cents more.. Only McDonald's chicken is better quality.. That's right McDonald's is better which is the only time I have or will ever say that.  Their burger was flavorless and had the same consistency as burgers you find in the frozen dinner isle at Walmart. They have a lot of bells and whistles. Like wings, seasoned fries and whatever but trust me it's not worth it. Don't waste your time go across the street you'll be happy you did.
4973	0	a	"I had high hopes for this place. When I learned that they were building one (at this location), I was incredibly stoked because (previously) they only had 1 on Boulder/Lamb and that was way to far for me to drive.\n\nThis would be the first time I have been able to eat frequently at a Checkers since I moved to Las Vegas from Georgia 10 years ago.\n\nUnfortunately, there are just too many flaws with this place for me to overlook, and here they are:\n\n(1) The cooks can't tell the difference between sandwiches: I ordered a Big Chicken Deluxe... the only difference between the 'Deluxe' and the regular Big Chicken sandwich is that the deluxe comes with a tomato and cheese. ON 2 OCCASIONS IN A ROW they forgot to add the tomato and cheese. I had to bring it back to the counter and explain it to them. The SAME staff prepared it both times... so apparently they don't learn their lesson nor do they care.\n\n(2) Pricing and menu layout is inaccurate and incredibly confusing. They have a HUGE sign on the OUTSIDE window stating that the \""Big Chicken Deluxe\"" is 2-for-$6 yet on the menu (at the top) inside the building, it says it's 2-for-$5 ... I pointed this out to the cashier and she did nothing to get this corrected. So, I ended up paying MORE than what the menu says.\n\n(3) For some strange reason, they make EVERYTHING available except napkins. Keep in mind this is really greasy food, so you're going to need some napkins. But, if you want napkins you have to go out of your way to ask them for some because they don't have the foresight"
4974	0	a	Went to checkers on a friends recommendation that they used to eat it all the time in California. I will start off by saying that the food is ok hence the one star, if I could give this place a 0 stars i still would give just the one star for the food. \n\nThe reason for the 4 star reduction is because of napkins and 3 stars because of the really crappy engineered drive through. Its the thinnest drive thru we have ever driven through. we made a wide right hand turn from the pick up window and still scraped our rim. Ok so I thought maybe we are just somewhat retarded and decided to eat our food in the car and watch other cars and how they navigate what I felt was crappy design. It took us 15 minutes to eat our food and in that time frame we counted 22 cars, 14 of them being Suvs out of the 14 suvs 9 of them hit the curb or ran over it. The other 8 vehicles 3 hit the curb. \n\nI would never ever recommend this place to anyone especially anyone who cares about their cars. If someone from Checkers reads this, I really think you guys need to redesign that drive thru.
4975	1	a	The food at this place is amazing. My favorite is the Chicken shawarma! I bring all my friends and family to this restaurant! The staff is friendly and very professional. Very delicious food, don't hesitate to give this place a try!
4976	1	a	Love this place! The portions are generous but it's not so much food that you feel gross afterwards. You can tell all the vegetables are fresh especially in the tabouli.. The tabouli is my favorite and its satisfying but still light..  If you are looking for authentic Lebanese food in Henderson/7 Hills area I suggest Shawarma Plus forsure.
4977	1	a	My wife and I live in the area and are pleasantly surprised by how nice Dakota came out.  Contrary to the other nightlife spots in this area, Dakota has a great morning and daytime vibe.  The interior is crisp and clean yet inviting. \n\nNow the best part of our visit was the coffee.  The cappuccino was smooth, the milk and coffee seemed to blend perfectly and create and almost silky texture.  I can say it was the best cappuccino I have had in AZ.  We will definitely come back for breakfast and will likely try lunch as they have a no mayo Tuna Melt.
4978	0	a	"Went for dinner with friends tonight. The place itself looks great, loved the lighting and projections on walls. That is the only thing that we found we liked. The music was a little loud and played during the commercials on TV, it was good club music though. When game came back on they switched on the audio for TVs. This was so loud that we could not talk across the table or even to the person next to us without raising our voices. This would not be a place to sit down for a relaxed meal and enjoy the company of the people you are with. Staff were friendly and for the most part attentive although apologized a lot for things they did not yet have. \n\nWe visited the website for the restaurant which is quite well done, the phone number listed though goes to a property management company that is not open on weekends. This number is on the website as well as on their facebook site. The menu on the website looked very good with a lot of options, once we got to the restaurant there was a limited menu. This was explained as they were trying some other options. The menu was so limiting as to have no appeal. Since they were trying out some options you would think they would come back and ask you what you that of them but this never occurred. There were salads but no appetizers. If you drink alcohol there were certainly options available. However, when ice tea was requested the response was the company they contract with had not delivered it so there was no ice tea yet. Certainly picking up a few bags of cold brew tea at a grocery store could solve this until vendor delivers. \n\nAs to the food itself, the short ribs had good flavor however they were cold inside. There was an Navajo fry bread option that had lamb on it. The flavor of the lamb, although a tad bit salty was overall very good. The \""fry bread\"" itself was inedible. It was nearly impossible to bite through and the taste was unpleasant. Of the three slightly bigger than silver dollar sized fry breads less than one of the actual bread parts was eaten. The meatballs were underwhelming and another ravioli/noodle dish looked so unappetizing as to not want to eat it. The Caesar salad was unremarkable and nothing about it wowed us. Portion sizes were small when based on price. The dishes almost seemed like appetizers rather than entrees\n\nHope this is just the issue that happens with a new opening and that they have success. It is concerning though if they have been open for less than two weeks and are already trying new menu options. The online menu was certainly appealing, the menu in the restaurant, had it been on line we never would have gone. Based on quantity and quality after we got done eating there we left and went out to eat. Do with the Dakota success however based on tonight they have a ways to go before they will be ready for primetime."
4979	1	a	Great ambiance, absolutely love the decor, very inviting and comfortable. The layout is great and not awkward when it's crowded. Went on a Friday night, good crowd great group of people. \n\nThey have a great brunch went on a Sunday and lots of TVs for game days! They have a DJ on Sunday's too . During the week they have a cute little coffee shop on the side for a quick coffee, pastry, and small snack that opens at 630 am. Great customer service easy to get a drink, definitely will be back!
4980	1	a	Red Rice serves the best chicken kelaguen!  \n\nI am Chamoru and grew up eating Chamoru food and this place by far has the best chicken kelaguen I have ever had.  I ordered the Grand Opening Plate which had 2 scoops of red rice, 1 scoop of chicken kelaguen, 1 lumpia, 1 shrimp patty, house salad (it was a choice between potato salad, grilled eggplant with coconut milk, or cucumber salad), bbq chicken, 1 bbq pork rib, bbq beef and a side of dipping sauce for the meat. The red rice was as it should be, orange-reddish color and not dry or too wet with a subtle flavor of achote which definitely complimented the other items on the plate.  The bbq chicken was my favorite out of all the bbq.  Grilled eggplant with coconut milk was just like my mom used to make, creamy and somewhat smoky with a slight citrus twist.  \n\nI went to Red Rice for dinner during their grand opening and though there was a bit of a wait, it was understandable.  The service was great though.  They apologized for the wait and even gave me 10% off my next visit which is a plus because I will be back.  The only con was the limited parking but I didn't mind walking over from the adjacent plaza.  \n\nRed Rice definitely does Guam proud!
4981	1	a	As a person who have lots of Chamorro friends,  they've been hyping the place up on Facebook even before they opened.\n\nHere's my two cents: food was great. Tasted very authentic and now there's a place I can go to when I'm craving some red rice and kelaguen. The kimchee was also great! \n\nBut, I think that next time, I will just order for pick up. Maybe it was the fact that they just opened, but the room for sitting is very limited. There's about 8 booths that seats 4 and one table for 6. There was 7 of us and someone had to sit in the car to eat. Yeah.... That wasn't too pleasant. The wait for the food is about 15-20 minutes after ordering. But the up side to that is that they make everything fresh. \n\nAside from that, I really have no complaints when it came to the quality and taste of the food. My niece and sister loved the lumpia (egg rolls) and I also liked it and the shrimp patty is also an honorable mention. Perhaps they might expand, which I hope they do. They are garnering alot of attention in the Islander community. And I wish them the best. I hope that they become very successful! I will definitely come back..for to go. LoL
4982	0	a	Buffet was recently open after renovation so my husband and I are thinking it should be pretty good....wrong. We arrived at 8:30 am for what we thought was a Saturday brunch offering champs, nope. Price is $21.95 but on Monday - Friday is $18.95...same food so why the increase? I can go to the Fiesta in Henderson with champs and better food for $8.99 Sat/Sun but we wanted to try something we thought was going to be an upgrade....lol what a joke. \n\n\nFood: everything I tried looked and tasted like food was leftover from the day before and reheated. \n\nShrimps were all water logged, the crab legs had a brownish color to them with an odd taste. \n\nPastries none..all offerings were donuts. They did have a fresh crepe bar, but then again looked very dry. I didn't want to stand on line for crepe paper. \n\nOverall I'm rating this one star because I have no choice.
4983	0	a	Having moved 15 times and having been referred to Classic Delivery- WHAT A NIGHTMARE.  VERY unprofessional and S L O W!!!!!!!  A move that should have taken no more than 6 hours stretched out to 10 hours.  The movers seemed to be strickly out of prison....just a TOTAL HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE.  Would DEFINATELY NOT RECOMMEND.
4984	1	a	We had the best experience. The movers were super polite and friendly. The service impeccable. The cost reasonable.   The truck was well equipped , everything was wrapped in plastic then wrapped in blankets.  There wasn't a mark on anything. I cannot stress how impressed we were.  I give them my highest rating , \nThey do book out about a week in advance so don't hesitate to call. \n65 per hour.
4985	0	a	A man came to the house to estimate. He gave me a card without a persons name on it (?) He said he recommended a large truck with three men. That is what was sent.\nVery nice men, contract employees, not employees of the company - but very nice.\nThey said they couldn't get all of our things in one truck and suggested they call for another truck. We declined at  that due to the additional cost. We had to make three additional trips with our vehicle and still leave several items in storage.\nA call to the office offered no help.
4986	1	a	Scottsdale Beer Company has only been open 2 days and the food and service were fantastic !!!!! Great new local hangout!! Didn't try the beer but it looked like they new what they were doing!
4987	1	a	Just found my new favorite hang out. This place has it all, good service, great beer selection, TVs all over the place, killer food menu, even the house music is on point. We will be visiting this place regularly.
4988	0	a	Really disappointing. Either the place was having a really off night (which you absolutely cannot have when you first open) or its just not good food. \n\nlet me start with one thing... we are not picky people. we honeslty are not one of these couples that send things back. we are the type like most who will just accept the bad food as a bad choice and eat something when we get home :)\n\nstarted with drinks... my girlfriend (who is cuban) said the Sangria was undrinkable. we sent it back - trust me - when it comes to alcohol we are never picky. if it gets you buzzed - it works. lol she couldnt even drink it. had to settle for a beer - of which her glass smelled like a wet rag. she was too embarrassed to say anything because we had just sent back the sangria\n\nwe ordered 4 things - some tapas and a margarita pizza to share.\n\nso - let me also say the place was empty.. only 3 tables were being used. probably bc that have done such a bad job letting people know its now open for business after many delays. the place is really nice. we walked in and were excited. looks like a very cool fun place to eat. \n\nbut the food was all a disappointment. they didnt have any platanos. so they had to cancel that (but still charged us for it on the final bill). the battered cod tapas were so salty they become almost inedible. she had a half of one and i choked down a couple more bc i was starving. but it was waaay too salty to be served in a restaurant. the pizza had potential - but the crust was odd.. we were joking that it looked almost like a wonton. i dont know if it was old or supposed to be like that - but it was hard. really hard. didnt taste fresh. again - i ate it because i was starving. she ordered the stuffed peppers tapas. also - very strange texture and taste. she ate half of one.. i stopped after a small taste. \n\ni know they are new - and i personally think they are having a hard time managing fresh food until crowds start coming in. we also got a kick out of the food being so bad and the chef outside shmoozing with the other two tables (which were obviously friends and family which made us the only real customers) instead of being in the kitchen. maybe if the chef spent more time in the kitchen and not on the floor the food will taste better.\n\nits a shame. i live across the street and was looking for this place to be a goto place like garfields was. perhaps i will try it again in the future. but someone will have to drag me. \n\ni write this in hopes the people at latin fish read this and work out all their kinks. id like them to succeed i think the place has a lot of potential to be a great hang out.
4989	1	a	When Corey sent the email about tickets being available for the show I jumped at the opportunity to score 2 free tickets. What a fun night! I honestly didn't watch a ton of I Love Lucy when I was little, but I knew enough about the show to know (kind of) what to expect. \n\nBut the show was so much better than I even expected. The cast were great, and Lucy and Ricky were perfect in their roles. I loved the combination of humor from the show, and humor from pulling an audience member on stage. My boyfriend and I were both entertained the entire time. \n\nThe Overture Center is beautiful, and our seats weren't half bad at all. Only complaint was that they are so close together. My boyfriend was pretty uncomfortable by the end of the show. He's pretty tall so he had to pretty much sit in a ball the whole time. But, I realize that's not always something that can be avoided!
4990	0	a	Wow, really?  Bought one item from them, a ham and cheese croissant.  First, I couldn't pay with my credit card since they weren't ready for such a strange form of payment.  Then, they were supposedly heating my order up with their toaster oven press and when I got to my room it was as if they had taken it out of the refrigerator.  Too bad I didn't notice it until I was already to my room.  Obviously they didn't have their little heater plugged in or something.  Plus, the woman at the counter who took my cash didn't even say thank you.  The other lady who thought she was heating up my order did say thank you to me.  That's the only reason they're getting two stars and not one.  You provide lousy service; you get one or two stars from me on Yelp.  Don't underestimate the power of reviews from real customers.  It'll decrease your businesses if you stink.  Thanks for reading.
4991	1	a	We tried the Cheese Danish w lemon. Creamy, flaky and not overly sweet. It was fantastic. Chocolate croissant was yummy too!
4992	0	a	Long line, inefficient staff. Maybe my expectations were too high but it just wasn't as good as I was hoping for the calories. We had the bread pudding and carrot cake cookie. Eh.
4993	0	a	"First: Please note that many people are reviewing the restaurant  NOT the bakery. \nMy review is for the bakery. I have been coming here for years, but I am extremely sad to report that my last two visits have revealed that they just don't care any more. \n\nThey seem content to just coast on their laurels selling this stuff to rubes and foreigners \n\nThe coffee is good, but the pastry is where they need to re-focus.  \n\nFirst, the biggest offender is their Macarons. They served us a nasty hateful hard lump of a cookie last week. This thing was seriously rock hard. They are supposed to be crispy with a slightly softer interior.  That is the WHOLE POINT of the cookie.  When we complained they said \""that is the way they are supposed to be, and the softer ones are old\"" No, no, they are not. You overcooked the crap out of these which formed, essentially, a meringue. \n I have eaten Macrons across the world and made them myself. I was in Paris a few month ago and took down a half dozen of these from Laduree. I am pretty familiar with this stupid little cookie because my wife loves them. \n\nDo not insult me by telling me this hammer-substitute is in any way acceptable. They told us to take it up with the downstairs location if we did not like it and refused to refund or exchange the cookie.  Astounding. \n\nThe rest of the menu items have just gone downhill. Their croissants are all but indistinguishable from the stuff they sling at buffets.  The outside should be flakey and the inside tender. Not some glupey congealed mess. You know how I know its a terrible croissant? There was absolutely no flakes to clean up. \n\nI hope Dominique Ansel opens a location and shows you guys whats up."
4994	0	a	I'm shocked everyone time I go to a Bouchon Bakery outside of Yountville. They are never good. Two stars just because it's located right by the elevators for the Venetian tower. But seriously, these places dilute the Bouchon brand :-(

I had some issues with my irrigation and he fixed them all quick and made sure all of the other lines looked as they should.\nWould definitely recommend this company to others and they will be my \"" go to \"" company for landscaping."
4996	1	a	Professional \nFriendly\nOn time AND affordable!\nWe will definitely call again if we need their irrigation repair services!!
4997	0	a	Phone calls always go to voicemail and messages are not returned.  Stupid way to do business.
4998	0	a	Looks like all of the good reviews have gone to their head at this place!  Jason and Ryan came out last fall and did a wonderful job pruning, etc.  Called them to come back this spring and no response after first call.  After second call, I was told they could only come on a Monday.  I work Mondays, and left a message what days would work for me. NEVER heard back from them!  After 3 calls, nothing.  Very UNRELIABLE and UNACCOMMODATING..
4999	1	a	Ryan Rocks! I called him this morning for some sprinkler help and some potential landscaping for my backyard. He showed up to my house within an hour and answered all of my questions! When I showed him how my irrigation box was leaking, he knew right away what to do - he went a grabbed a new part out of his truck, put it on, and it was fixed! He then set up my watering timer and we talked about some landscaping and pricing. His prices seemed great and I will definitely use him in the future! To top it all off, when I asked him what I owed him for fixing my irrigation leak and his time, he said don't worry about it! I was shocked and couldn't believe his service! Thank you so much Ryan!
