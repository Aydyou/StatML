1,"Food was alright, got the pide ground beef n cheese and the beef and lamb doner kebab. The taste was slightly off but I assumed it was just how doner kebab here tastes. Issue was the food poisoning I had for almost a week after eating here. I'm sure it was the doner that did it. Really wanted to give them 5 stars but using old meat or any stale food product is a big NO in my book especially if you run a restaurant."
